The deficits that follow ischemic stroke include memory and learning impairment. There are presently no treatments that can combat the effects of ischemia after the attack has occurred. Immediately following insult, locomotor activity increases in rodent models. The goal of the current research is to determine if methamphetamine administration following ischemic attack will have neuroprotective effects and prevent changes in locomotor behavior that are observed following insult. Ischemic insult was induced in gerbils by clamping the carotid arteries for 5 mins. Subjects in the sham surgical condition underwent similar surgical procedures, but the carotids were not clamped. Then, subjects were assigned randomly to saline or methamphetamine (5 mg/kg) injection groups. Drug treatment was administered within 2 mins of surgery. Measures of distance traveled, average speed, and number of line crossings were evaluated. Differences in levels of locomotion during the first and second halves of testing were also evaluated. Finally, sections containing the hippocampal CA1 region were rated on a 4-point scale for level of damage. Results show that subjects in the ischemic and saline condition traveled significantly further than those in the sham conditions and ischemic and methamphetamine condition. The speed of ischemic subjects treated with saline was significantly higher than ischemic subjects that received methamphetamine and sham conditions. Also, subjects in the ischemic and saline treatment group crossed more lines than sham and ischemic animals treated with methamphetamine. Analysis of cresyl violet-stained brain sections of ischemic animals treated with saline were rated as having less neuronal cell bodies in the CA 1 region. Ischemic and methamphetamine treated subjects' sections were similar to sham and saline treatment sections. These results suggest that methamphetamine, when injected after transient ischemic attack, may provide neuroprotection from damage that occurs to the CA1 region and prevent the impairments in locomotor behavior.</field><field name="date">2007-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/weeden/WeedenC0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preservice Elementary Teachers' Mathematical Content Knowledge of Prerequisite Algebra Concepts</field><field name="creator">Welder, Rachael Mae</field><field name="description">Research illustrating that student achievement is affected by teachers' knowledge advocates for K-8 teachers to be knowledgeable regarding prerequisite algebra concepts: (1) numbers (numerical operations), (2) ratios/proportions, (3) the order of operations, (4) equality, (5) patterning, (6) algebraic symbolism (including letter usage), (7) algebraic equations, (8) functions, and (9) graphing. The theoretical framework for the knowledge for teaching mathematics built for this study suggests that the mathematical content knowledge needed for teaching consists of specialized content knowledge in addition to common content knowledge. Specialized mathematical content knowledge extends beyond solving mathematical problems to encompass how and why mathematical procedures work and an awareness of structuring and representing mathematical content for learners. The effects of an undergraduate mathematics content course for elementary education students on preservice teachers' common and specialized content knowledge of prerequisite algebra concepts was investigated, using a pre-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design. A quantitative, 51-item, multiple-choice instrument, developed specifically to measure both types of content knowledge with respect to prerequisite algebra concepts, was constructed from the Learning Mathematics for Teaching Project's Content Knowledge for Teaching Mathematics Measures question bank. This instrument was administered to all students enrolled in Mathematics for Elementary Teachers I (n = 48), at Montana State University, during the fall semester of 2006. Matched pairs t-tests, comparing pretest and posttest scores within the single sample, show significant gains (p = .000) in both common and specialized content knowledge and in all tested aspects of prerequisite algebra knowledge (numbers and equations/functions). Results also suggest a significant correlation (r = .716, p = .000) between preservice teachers' common and specialized content knowledge. Lastly, a oneparameter linear model was constructed to predict the number of participants to incorrectly answer each item, based on item difficulty. Items missed by notably more or less students than predicted were identified and analyzed. The one item students performed better than expected on addresses common content knowledge regarding a linear graph. The set of troublesome items address both common and specialized content knowledge of reading, writing, and representing functions in a variety of contexts and using ratios to write and solve proportions.</field><field name="date">2007-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/welder/WelderR0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evolution Debate Onscreen: Unreliable Narrators Find A Home</field><field name="creator">White, Libbey Katherine</field><field name="description">Faced with increasingly influential opposition from fundamentalist religious groups, evolutionists could benefit from reexamining their strategies in the evolution vs. creation debate.

The modeling effort is based on recent experimental results for infused glass fiber laminates typical of current blades, and hybrid carbon prepreg laminates of potential interest for future blades. There are two focus areas: in-plane performance represented by stress-life (S-N) curves, and out-of-plane ply delamination at details including ply drops and joints, based on fracture mechanics. In-plane fatigue models for both the mean performance and a statistically fit model with a 95/95 confidence limit were developed for three laminates, each representative of lower cost materials with applications in the wind turbine industry. These include polyester and epoxy resin infused glass fabrics and a hybrid carbon prepreg; two of the materials were tested in the axial and transverse directions. Models were adapted for the S-N results at several uniaxial loading conditions, including special treatment of the time dependence at high loads. Materials are compared in terms of their fatigue exponents, constant life diagrams and in the context of a wind loads spectrum. The second part of this work contains a modeling study of delamination crack development in various composite structure detail regions using finite element analysis. Geometries include various ply joints, ply drops, and material transition areas, all using relatively thick glass and carbon fiber prepregs typical of lower cost applications. Two dimensional finite element models were used to determine the strain energy release rates, GI and GII, of delamination cracks by virtual crack closure with contact elements. Results are correlated with experimental data and approximate models where available. The model results, while static in nature, offer insight into trends observed for delamination under fatigue loading for various geometries and material variations, including a more detailed study of tapered ply drops. The results support and help explain experimentally observed trends of fatigue delamination resistance with material (glass and carbon), ply thickness, and crack locations. The influence of ply mis-orientation and ply drop location on the GI (opening mode) component is also explored.</field><field name="date">2007-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/wilson/WilsonT0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Moral Integrity Development on Nursing Students in Two-Year Colleges</field><field name="creator">Wirtz, Ellen Frances</field><field name="description">Moral integrity development and professional decision making ability is a vital characteristic in nurses. A review of the literature revealed that while the moral development of baccalaureate nursing students had been investigated, there was little data investigating the variables affecting the moral development of nursing students in two-year colleges. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate if age, gender, prior work experience in the health care field, prior college experience and grade point average made a difference in the moral development of nursing students in two-year colleges at the beginning and at the end of their nursing programs. The cognitive development theory of Piaget, the moral development theory of Kohlberg, Gilligan's theory of the moral development in women and Parse's nursing theory of human becoming formed the framework for this research. A cross sectional cluster sample of first term and final term nursing students enrolled at two year colleges were tested using Rest's Defining Issues Test - 2 (DIT - 2) to measure moral development. The sample included 156 first term nursing students and 144 final term nursing students currently enrolled at eight, two-year colleges in the Pacific northwest region of the United States. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were used to investigate the difference in moral development when considering these independent variables: term in program, age, gender, prior work experience in the health care setting, prior college experience and grade point average. Results indicated moral development was different in first term nursing students compared with final term nursing students at two-year colleges. Age and prior college experience were significant independent variables in moral development while gender, prior work experience in the health care setting and grade point average were not found to be significant variables.</field><field name="date">2007-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/wirtz/WirtzE0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mode-Locked Ramam Laser in H2 Pumped by a Mode-Locked External Cavity Diode Laser</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Yihan</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a theory is first presented for a far-off resonance mode-locked Raman laser in H2 with high finesse cavity enhancement. The theoretical derivation for the mode-locked Raman laser is based on semiclasscial laser theory and time-dependent continuous wave (CW) Raman theory. Numerically calculated results, including the intracavity fields\' amplitude and phase evolution and output Stokes power versus input pump power are discussed in three different regimes depending on the relationship between the coherence dephasing rate and the repetition rate of the mode-locked pump laser. Then experimentally, first an actively mode-locked external-cavity diode laser (ML-ECDL) was built along with a demonstration of how to frequency lock all the longitudinal modes from the ML-ECDL to a high finesse cavity. Then a tapered amplifier diode system was designed to increase the ML-ECDL power. Finally, a far-off resonance mode-locked Raman laser pumped by a ML-ECDL was demonstrated. With nine longitudinal pump modes, when operating at an average power level slightly above the CW threshold (3.89 mW), each of the pump modes, taken on its own, is below the CW lasing threshold. If these pump modes are not in-phase, the threshold will be nine times the CW threshold, roughly 35 mW. However the measured threshold for the ML Raman laser is about 5.4 mW, much less than 35 mW, because the pump modes are in-phase, and they can augment each other through four-wave-mixing processes causing all of them to lase as expected from the theory. The full width half maximum of the ML Stokes output is 310 ps. The beat signals from the ML Stokes showed that the Stokes pulses were made of at least eight modes.</field><field name="date">2007-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/xiong/XiongY0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between First-Generation College-Bound Students' Stated Intentions to Attend a 4-year College or University Directly after High School and the Engagement Factors of Students, their Parents, and their Peers</field><field name="creator">Zuck, Barbara Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between tenth grade first-generation college-bound students stated intentions to attend a 4-year college or university directly after high school and the engagement factor of students, their parents, and their peers. Data collected for the National Center for Education Statistics Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (NCES ELS:2002) were used in this study. The population for this study was tenth grade students in 2002. The NCES ELS:2002 is a nationally representative sample of that population. The dependent variable was first-generation college-bound students' stated intentions to attend a 4-year college or university directly after high school. Twenty-two independent variables, classified by student, parent, and peer engagement factors, were used in this study. A logistic regression model developed from a backward stepwise regression analysis was used to answer the primary research question considered in this study: "What relationships exist between first-generation college-bound students' stated intentions to attend a 4-year college or university directly after high school and the engagement factors of students, their parents, and their peers?" A number of significant positive relationships were shown to exist between the dependent variable and independent variables. The results suggest that students' college entrance test plans in grade 10 and grade 11, participation in an AP program, and AP test plans appear to be important predictors of students' intentions. When considering the highest positive odds ratio among all independent variables included in this study, the results suggest that the parent engagement factor, educational aspirations for the tenth grade child: graduate from college with a BA/BS degree or higher, stands out as the strongest predictor of students' intentions. The results suggest that peer influences matter. Students who stated intentions were more likely to have friends who feel it is important to attend classes regularly, study, get good grades, finish high school, and continue their education. The results also suggest that three independent variables were not found to be predictors of students' intentions: 1) student' participation in a college preparation program; 2) parents' checking of school work; and 3) parents' financial savings for the tenth grade child's postsecondary education.</field><field name="date">2007-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/zuck/ZuckB0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FP-growth approach for document clustering</field><field name="creator">Akbar, Monika</field><field name="description">Since the amount of text data stored in computer repositories is growing every day, we need more than ever a reliable way to group or categorize text documents. Most of the existing document clustering techniques use a group of keywords from each document to cluster the documents. In this thesis, we have used a sense based approach to cluster documents instead of using only the frequency of the keywords. We use relationships between the keywords to cluster the documents. The relationships are retrieved from the WordNet ontology and represented in the form of a graph. The document-graphs, which reflect the essence of the documents, are searched in order to find the frequent subgraphs. To discover the frequent subgraphs, we use the Frequent Pattern Growth (FP-growth) approach, which was originally designed to discover frequent patterns. The common frequent subgraphs discovered by the FP-growth approach are later used to cluster the documents. The FP-growth approach requires the creation of an FP-tree. Mining the FP-tree, which is created for a normal transaction database, is easier compared to large document-graphs, mostly because the itemsets in a transaction database is smaller compared to the edge list of our document-graphs. Original FP-tree mining procedure is also easier because the items of a traditional transaction database are stand-alone entities and have no direct connection to each other. In contrast, as we look for subgraphs in graphs, they become related to each other in the context of connectivity. The computation cost makes the original FP-growth approach somewhat inefficient for text documents. We modify the FP-growth approach, making it possible to generate frequent subgraphs from the FP-tree. Later, we cluster documents using these subgraphs.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/akbar/AkbarM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of agricultural educators\' servant leadership style on student participation in service-learning activities</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Mary Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of servant leadership characteristics present in agricultural educators\' leadership styles to the use of service- learning activities in their curriculum.

An on-line and written survey was conducted with agricultural educators who were members of the National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE) and lived in NAAE Region 1. The survey used Ann Todd Abel\'s Servant Leadership Inventory to analyze the servant leadership characteristics and behavior exhibited by educators.

The cross sectioning ability inherent in confocal microscopes provides a method for viewing of cellular structure at different layers of a histology sample, allowing for optical cross sectioning and viewing structures below the surface of the sample. As a cancer diagnosis technique, confocal microscopy has been shown to provide valuable information showing differences in cell morphology of malignant and benign regions. Raman spectroscopy has also been shown to be a useful tool for cancer diagnosis in skin tissues due to its ability to distinguish different types of chemical bonds. While both of these methods may be used for cancer detection, current devices are limited to ex vivo samples. The goal of this project was to design and build a hand held microscope which could be used for in vivo confocal imaging and Raman spectroscopy of suspected malignant lesions in skin. This thesis describes the optical, mechanical and electrical design and fabrication of the microscope, as well as performance testing and initial in vivo skin data collected with the microscope. It is our hope that this instrument will be used to gather important in vivo skin cancer data and spur future developments in small diagnosis tools that can be used in a clinical setting.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/arrasmith/ArrasmithC1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust copper braze for hermetic sealing of solid oxide fuel cells</field><field name="creator">Ator, Danielle Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are becoming of increasing interest as a primary power source in today\'s industrial market. The voltage of a single cell under load is approximately 0.7 volts necessitating the use of many cells in series to generate useful electrical potentials, which gives rise to the SOFC stack. One of the key technical challenges in improving the long term performance and reliability of stacks is in the effective sealing of stack interfaces, particularly in planar stacks for which a hot seal (700-900&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C) is required. SOFC stack seals must be: resistant to oxidation/volatilization in oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, must wet and bond to the joining members (both ceramic and metal), form a hermetic seal to prevent hydrogen leakage, and have a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) close to that of the adjoining components to limit thermally induced stresses. Active metal copper-based brazes present a novel approach to sealing SOFCs by means of robust mechanical/thermal properties providing strong, hermetic braze-interconnect and braze-YSZ interfaces. A commercially available active braze alloy utilizing no precious metal additives was tested and compared to custom synthesized braze compositions fabricated and tested at MSU. Two testing configurations were evaluated for this sealing study, utilizing dense YSZ substrates joined to 25.24mm, 430SS coupons as well as 25mm 440SS pressure test fixtures. Active braze alloys require a protective atmosphere to facilitate chemical bonding with YSZ and results show excellent performance in moderate vacuum (10-4 to 10-5 mbar) and argon atmosphere. Sample characterization was performed by electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, pressurized rupture and leak tests, differential thermal analysis, thermal gravimetric analysis and thermodynamic evaluation. Robust copper-based brazes show potential for the use of sealing in SOFC applications. The brazes display desirable characteristics for sealing applications including the formation of chemically bonded braze joints, formation of a protective oxide barrier and high strength properties. Evidence of silicon diffusion into the YSZ may be problematic for long-term SOFC operation, however, development of a siliconfree braze has yielded excellent performance near that of the commercially available brazing powder.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/ator/AtorD0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breakthrough of indicator organisms from slow sand filters as part of a drinking water production system for Sub-Saharan Africa</field><field name="creator">Ba, Sidy</field><field name="description">Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest proportion of population in the world with access to potable water, so that there is a dire need for low-cost, low-energy robust treatment technologies for drinking water. Constructed wetlands followed by optimized slow sand filtration has the potential for improving raw surface water quality to an acceptable level. A laboratory study examined the removal of Enterococcus durans and environmental coliforms with associated heterotrophic bacteria from slow sand columns operating with different sand sizes and flow conditions. E. durans removal far exceeded 90% in most systems, with better performance from a sand column with finer sand size (0.425 mm) and continuous flow. A column with 0.425 mm sand also performed better than a column with 0.6 mm when both were operated intermittently. Removal of environmental coliforms followed the same trends as observed with E. durans, but with roughly four times the overall breakthrough. Correction of the column breakthrough data to remove the effect of decay observed in control columns demonstrated that, in most cases, E. durans removal was accomplished by more than static loss of culturability. In the case of the environmental coliforms, corrected breakthrough was still below 100%, but much higher than with the E. durans, suggesting that extrapolation of results from a single species could produce erroneous estimates of removal of other organisms.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/ba/BaS0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution, characterization, and dietary risk assessment of indigenous salts in Mongolia's Darhad Valley</field><field name="creator">Barber, Loren Mickelle</field><field name="description">Natural salt deposits around the world are used as human and livestock dietary mineral sources. The nomadic herders of the Darhad Valley, in northern Mongolia, harvest the precipitate that forms around saline lakes throughout their valley. The precipitate is termed hujir, and the main harvest location is Tukh. Darhad people are concerned about the declining amount of a hujir in the Tukh precipitate area and are curious about possible health effects related to hujir consumption. These studies focus on formulating the best management practices for sustainable hujir harvest by evaluating factors influencing the formation of hujir, and by establishing the mineralogy and ionic concentrations in Tukh soil, water, and hujir through chemical and spatial analyses. A dietary risk assessment was also accomplished by obtaining consumption rates through interviews, and determining exposure values from the consumption rates and ionic concentrations. Exposures were compared to chronic oral endpoints to relate potential health risks. A map of Tukh was created using Global Positioning System and Geographic Information System technologies and acts as baseline spatial data on the area. Minerals present include trona, halite, calcite, and other evaporites. According to pH and EC results, the area used for human harvesting at Tukh is more saline than the remainder of the lake. The soil profile within the precipitate area showed a TDS of 49 mg/L and pH of 7.2 in the surface horizon relative to an EC of 0.4 mg/L and a pH of 6.4 lower in the profile. This indicates a presence of capillary rise from groundwater, resulting in evaporation and salt precipitate at the soil surface. High exposure of arsenic, antimony, and lead compared to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization endpoint values resulted in risk quotients of 33, 1.7, and 14, respectively, which create concern in the population's hujir consumption. Further epidemiological and biomonitoring research would provide insight in the health relationships to hujir consumption. Future research could benefit from the resulting spatial and chemical data completed in these studies.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/barber/BarberL0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying predator-prey theory to evaluate large mammal dynamics: wolf predation in a newly-established multiple-prey system</field><field name="creator">Becker, Matthew Smith</field><field name="description">I studied wolf prey selection and kill rates during 1996-97 through 2006-07 winters in a newly established two-prey system in central Yellowstone National Park. Prey differed substantially in their vulnerability to wolf (Canis lupus) predation and wolves preyed primarily on elk (Cervus elaphus) but also used bison (Bison bison) to varying degrees within and among winters and packs. Winter severity, wolf abundance, distribution, and prey selection varied during the study, concurrent with variations in the demography, distribution, and behavior of elk and bison. A total of 759 wolf-killed ungulates were detected and prey selection by wolves was influenced by the absolute and relative abundance of prey types, the abundance of predators, and the duration of snow pack. Wolves strongly preferred elk calves relative to all other prey types, and elk calf abundance was inversely related to the occurrence of bison in wolf diets. Increasing wolf numbers also broadened prey selection from elk calves, and predation on bison and adult elk increased with increasing snow pack accumulation and duration, likely due to its long-term debilitating influence. Elk abundance and wolf pack size best explained variation in kill rates for elk while bison calf abundance and snow pack duration best explained kill rates of bison. The functional response of wolves for elk was best described by a Type II ratio-dependent model, indicating significant predator dependence. Prey-switching evaluations indicated increasing selection of bison with increasing bison:elk ratios, however no concurrent decrease in elk predation occurred. Increased bison predation is not solely dependent on relative abundance of the two prey species; therefore it is unlikely at this time that wolf prey-switching will stabilize the system.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/becker/BeckerM1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of gene expression control in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii</field><field name="creator">Behnke, Michael Sean</field><field name="description">Our understanding of global gene expression patterns and control of both developmental and strain specific aspects of Toxoplasma gondii has broadened in the past few years. A global approach was initially undertaken to construct the "transcriptome" for the Toxoplasma intermediate life cycle using serial-analysis-of-gene expression (SAGE). From this analysis, we confirmed the increased expression of known as well as novel mRNAs associated with the tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite transition. Accumulation of bradyzoite specific mRNAs in the bradyzoite SAGE libraries raises the possibility that transcriptional mechanisms play a key role in the developmental switch. To investigate this question, we adapted the dual luciferase model to recombinational cloning in order to construct a high throughput model for testing and mapping multiple bradyzoite promoters. Expression of luciferase from constructs matched previously published results indicating that developmental gene expression in Toxoplasma is controlled by elements contained in the 5'-flanking regions upstream of the protein coding regions. Promoter cis-elements from two genes, BAG1 and B-NTPase, have been fine mapped to 6-8 bp. EMSA assays confirm that these elements form sequence specific protein/DNA complexes. These data suggest that gene proximal cis-elements are required to initiate developmental gene expression, most likely by the binding of gene-specific trans-acting factors. Although strategies to identify these putative trans factors such as yeast one-hybrid are ongoing, we describe here a more global approach to identifying controllers of gene expression. We conducted an expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) mapping project that combines the power of Affymetrix microarray technology and QTL mapping to explore the genetic basis of differences in stage-specific gene expression in Type I versus III parasite strains and in F1 progeny from the I X III cross. Gene expression QTLs discovered in this analysis were either local or non-local to the associated transcriptional change and reflect proximal cis-mutations, transcription factors or central mechanisms that co-regulate gene expression during tachyzoite differentiation. Additionally, we identified segmental duplication events in various parents and progeny of the Type I X III cross that have a gene dosage effect on the level of gene expression in those parasites.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/behnke/BehnkeM0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defoliation effects on Spotted Knapweed seed production and viability</field><field name="creator">Benzel, Katie Rebecca</field><field name="description">Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe L.) is a deeply taprooted perennial forb infesting millions of hectares of rangeland in western North America. Spotted knapweed forms large monocultures, which lowers plant diversity, reduces livestock and wildlife forage, and increases surface water runoff and sediment yield. It can produce 5,000-40,000 seeds m-2  year-1, and often produces new flowers after prescribed sheep grazing or mowing defoliates spotted knapweed plants during the bolting or flowering stage. Research has yet to determine if new flowers produced following spring/summer defoliation produce viable seeds by the end of the growing season. The purpose of this 2-year study was to determine the appropriate timing(s) or combination(s) of timings of defoliation on spotted knapweed to reduce viable seed production. Ten spotted knapweed plants, located on spotted knapweed-infested rangeland in west-central Montana, were hand-clipped for each of the following treatments: 1) 35-40% relative utilization of above-ground biomass when plants were in the bolting stage; 2) 100% of buds removed at late-bud/early-flowering stage; 3) 100% of flowers removed at full-flowering stage; 4) Treatment 1+Treatment 2; 5) Treatment 1+Treatment 3; 6) Treatment 2+Treatment 3; 7) Treatment 1+Treatment 2+Treatment 3; and 8) unclipped control. The number of buds/flowerheads per plant, number of seeds per plant, percent viability of seeds, and number of viable seeds per plant were determined when seeds were in the well-developed stage, but seedhead bracts were still tightly closed (mid-August through September). Clipping at any timing or combination of timings reduced the number of buds/flowerheads per plant (P &lt; 0.01), number of seeds per plant (P &lt; 0.01), percent viability of seeds (P &lt; 0.01), and number of viable seeds per plant (P &lt; 0.01) both years compared with the unclipped control. Clipping during the bolting stage reduced the number of viable seeds by nearly 90% compared with no clipping. Clipping during the late-bud/early-flower or full-flower stage reduced the number of viable seeds by nearly 100% compared with no clipping.

The purpose of this study is to explore patient perceptions of chronic pain treatment options. The framework for guiding this study was Neuman&amp;acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s Systems Model (1995) based on the concepts of stress, client stability, and intervention. A review of the literature was completed that revealed very little information on the topic and therefore further research regarding patient perceptions of treatment options for chronic pain was warranted. Nine patients participated in interviews and shared their experiences with treatment options and contexts or situations that influenced or affected those experiences of treatment options. Participants described their experience with chronic pain to include options available to them; the effectiveness of the methods tried; lifestyle changes associated with their pain; feelings of hopelessness for the future relative to pain resolution as well as available options; the effects of listening and understanding; and depression.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/benzschawel/BenzschawelV0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geographic and economic importance of hunting in Southwestern Montana, USA</field><field name="creator">Bergstrom, Ryan Dennis</field><field name="description">Montana\'s big game species were at one time brought to near extinction through exploitation and the myth of superabundance. Today they are seen as one of the state\'s most prized possessions, with millions of dollars spent annually on their sustainability through the management efforts of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Funding for Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks is provided through a hunter and manufacturer sponsored excise equipment tax provided through the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Program, or as it is more commonly referred to, the Pittman-Robertson Act, as well as state hunter license and permit fees. Conservation efforts provided through these funds are directly and indirectly responsible for increased harvest numbers and hunter participation, as well as the expansion of lands conserved to sustain these wildlife populations. By providing a healthy and diverse variety of game species, the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is able to continually attract hunters to the state. This in turn, increases hunter expenditures that fund additional conservation efforts, while at the same time contributing to local economies via food, lodging, equipment, and transportation expenditures. The objective of this study was to determine the relationships between hunter-supported expenditures by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, hunter participation rates, species\' harvest rates, and hunters\' economic impact on communities. It is hypothesized that there will exist a positive relationship and feedback the between amount of hunter-related expenditures, hunter participation and harvest rates, and hunters\' economic impact on local communities. The importance of this study was to develop a methodology by which these relationships can be determined, and hence, used elsewhere, as well as to demonstrate to regional hunting and non-hunting community, the importance and value of hunting.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bergstrom/BergstromR0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The architecture of well-being:  creating effective design for the care and treatment of the mentally ill</field><field name="creator">Berwald, Sarah Moch</field><field name="description">This thesis synthesizes research performed by environmental psychologists, architects and medical researchers on the human experience of a specific architectural typology: the inpatient psychiatric hospital. These studies, as well as non-fictional narratives of life in a psychiatric institution, are used to demonstrate that the treatment of psychiatric patients is intertwined with the architecture of the facility, and that this patient group is therefore highly sensitive to architectural design. The conclusions drawn from the research described above imply that statewide agencies which fund architectural investments of this type can see, relatively clearly, how greater funding can result in better patient outcomes and shorter patient stays. The conclusions also imply that architects can use evidence-based design to clearly demonstrate that design is correlated with human health. Finally, the thesis implies that while architecture remains an artistic practice in many respects, certain typologies, such as the inpatient psychiatric facility, need to draw heavily from scientifically based sources.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/berwald/BerwaldS1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat comparisons of historically stable and less stable bighorn sheep populations</field><field name="creator">Beyer, Ashley Chantel</field><field name="description">Limited research has examined how habitat differences between stable and less stable bighorn populations may influence their success. Understanding these habitat differences may help explain how habitat contributes to bighorn sheep population stability. The objective of the study was to identify potential limiting habitat factors for the Tendoy Mountains bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population in western Montana. Habitat variables that were evaluated are unlikely to be influenced by fine-scale weather or disturbance patterns. Land cover, slope, aspect, elevation, landscape ruggedness, solar radiation index (SRI), and distance to escape terrain were measured using GIS. Shrub canopy cover, graminoid and forb frequency, and horizontal visibility were measured in the field. Logistic regression was used to identify habitat differences between the stable and less stable sheep populations in summer and winter. Odds ratios from the logistic regressions were used to identify potential limiting habitat variables for the less stable population. Results from this study indicate that landscape ruggedness (P &lt;0.01) and aspect (P &lt;0.01) in summer ranges, and landscape ruggedness (P =0.01), aspect (P &lt;0.01), and SRI (P &lt;0.01) in winter ranges were the habitat characteristics most likely influencing population stability. Landscape ruggedness and SRI are relatively new habitat metrics that require more research to determine threshold values for bighorn sheep habitat. Results from this study provide initial insights into potential threshold values for landscape ruggedness and SRI for Rocky Mountain bighorns.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/beyer/BeyerA1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epistolary archaeology:  piecing together \'the self\' in Victorian-American love letters</field><field name="creator">Biehl, Mary Ann</field><field name="description">Epistolary Archaeology: Piecing Together \"The Self\" in Victorian-American Love Letters is a thesis resulting from four years of extensive research, transcription, editing, and writing about the question of authorial identity in post-Civil War life writings, particularly love letters. Epistolary Studies first became interesting to me in July of 2005 while I was researching a family-related collection of documents being housed at Dartmouth College\'s Rauner Special Collections Library. During this week of sifting through 30 boxes of my family\'s military, publishing, and teaching careers going back to pre-Civil War American times, I uncovered a collection of 142 love letters written from my great-great grandfather, Montgomery Meigs, to my great-great grandmother, Grace Cornelia Lynde, during their trans-Atlantic epistolary courtship of 1875-1876. From this project, I have gained a better understanding of how men and women communicated with one another romantically through letter writing in the Victorian American time period, post-Civil War. A conclusion that I came to through my research methods and applied theories is that the question of authorial authenticity becomes even more complicated when attempting to analyze life writings such as love letters because of the public practices and constraints placed upon writers who attempt to create a private intimate space through letters to one another. However, one can gain a better understanding of life writing authorial identity and can make a more educated assumption of what a writer\'s personality may have been like by piecing together contextual clues through extensive research. The process of what I call Epistolary Archaeology is shown in practice throughout the following thesis.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/biehl/BiehlM1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting feeding site selection of mule deer on foothill and mountain rangelands</field><field name="creator">Bilbao, Joshua Vicente</field><field name="description">Determining areas on the landscape selected by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) for foraging and the characteristics of selected feeding sites is a crucial step in managing mule deer and its habitat. Mule deer populations in much of western North America have been declining since the early 1990\'s, making management of mule deer increasingly difficult. Limited research has examined the characteristics of mule deer habitat that influence feeding site selection in foothill and mountain rangeland habitats during the winter and spring. The purpose of the study was to develop and validate models that incorporate the effects of important habitat variables that influence feeding sites chosen by mule deer in the winter and spring, including aspect, distance to forested cover, distance to hiding cover, distance to agricultural fields, distance to improved roads, distance to ranch roads, elevation, previous cattle grazing, and slope. Data collected in northwestern Wyoming between the summer of 1999 and spring of 2001 were used for model development, and data collected between summer 2001 and spring 2003 were used for temporal validation. Additionally, data collected in west-central Montana between summer 2001 and spring 2003 were used for temporospatial validation. Logistic regression was used to develop models for the winter, spring, and winter-spring seasons. Akaike\'s Information Criterion was used to determine the best models for each season. Models were validated on both a temporal and temporospatial scale. Six habitat variables (distance to improved roads, distance to ranch roads, distance to security cover, aspect, slope, and previous summer\'s cattle grazing) were included in model development after collinearity tests. Four models had a model sensitivity &gt; or equal to 75% in both temporal and temporospatial validation. These models can be used to identify preferred mule deer feeding sites and assess potential impacts of land management practices on mule deer foraging habitat.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bilbao/BilbaoJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of In(OTf)3 as a Lewis Acid in carbohydrate chemistry, and exploration in silicon tethered reactions</field><field name="creator">Bizier, Nicholas Paul</field><field name="description">The feasibility of using Indium (III) triflate as a Lewis Acid for a number of different carbohydrate reactions was explored. First, the use of In(OTf)3 as a catalyst in the acylation of a number of carbohydrates was explored. The utility and compatibility of the In(OTf)3 reaction conditions with a number of protecting groups on the sugars were examined by 1H NMR analysis. In the second part of the carbohydrate methodology, the feasibility of using In(OTf)3 to promote glycosylation reactions using a number of glycosyl donors was evaluated. These studies were conducted using 1H NMR, 13CNMR, and Micro-ToF mass spectrometry. In both cases, In(OTf)3 was found to be a viable if highly acidic Lewis acid for these reactions. Silicon tether methodology was explored with the goal of obtaining 1,3 and 1,2-amino alcohols. The parameters for this reaction were explored after precursors and 1,3-amino alcohols were synthesized. These studies were conducted using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR spectroscopy, and Micro-ToF mass spectrometry. While some success was achieved, this route is unlikely to be widely adopted due to the multi-step syntheses that are required to obtain viable reaction precursors.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bizier/BizierN1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced studies of fish passage through culverts: 1-D and 3-D hydraulic modeling of velocity, fish energy expenditure, and a new barrier assessment method</field><field name="creator">Blank, Matthew David</field><field name="description">Fish passage through culverts is an important component of road and stream crossing design. Although no comprehensive inventory of the number of culverts on fishbearing streams in the United States is available, there is an estimated 1.4 million streamroad crossings. The most common physical characteristics that create barriers to fish passage include excessive water velocity, insufficient water depth and large outlet drop heights. Over the past decade, interest in the effect culvert barriers have on aquatic systems has grown; accordingly, various passage assessment techniques have been used to determine whether a structure is a barrier and to what degree (its &amp;acirc;&#8364;&#339;barrierity&amp;acirc;&#8364;&#157;). Recent research has shown that determining the barrierity of a culvert is not trivial, and that different methods are often not congruent in their classification of &amp;acirc;&#8364;&#339;barrierity&amp;acirc;&#8364;&#157;.  The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of velocity on fish passage in great detail by: testing the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for estimating the 3-D velocity field through a culvert; quantifying velocity diversity through culverts for a range of flows; characterizing the energy expenditure paths through a culvert and identifying the passageways Yellowstone cutthroat trout used to successfully negotiate passage; and developing and testing a new barrier assessment method. The research was done, in part, by studying fish passage through culverts in Mulherin Creek, an important spawning tributary for Yellowstone cutthrout trout migrating from the Yellowstone River.  Comparisons between predicted and observed velocities show 86% and 82% of variation in the observed velocity data were explained by the CFD model, for flow rates of 1.44 m3/s and 0.87 m3/s, respectively. The diverse velocity field through the culvert barrel created a range of energy expenditure paths through the entire culvert length. Fish movement observations showed successful passage only for trout seeking and using the minimum energy path created, in part, by the skew between the upstream channel and the culvert. This research investigated a new hydraulic approach to assessing barriers that uses the 3-D velocity field. Comparisons between estimated passage and measured passage show the 3-D method most accurately indicated passability compared to a 1-D method.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/blank/BlankM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feasibility in developing smart structures for use in wind turbine blades</field><field name="creator">Blockey, James Craig</field><field name="description">Recently the use of wind as an alternative energy source has developed quickly. The length of the blades is a leading factor in the power output of a wind turbine and as a result, blade length has grown at a similar pace to the growth of the industry. The rapid expansion in use and size of wind turbines is not without its problems, though. As the industry has changed and grown, the overall design of the blades has remained relatively stagnant. This is evident in two primary areas, power control and health monitoring. Power control mechanisms are generally unchanged, utilizing either pitch control or active stall designs. While effective, these systems are neither efficient nor fast acting and can contribute to higher maintenance requirements. Current wind turbine blades also have no sensors built into them. The nacelle and tower utilize many sensors, but the blades themselves have none, leading to blades which are incapable of any real time health monitoring. The application of smart structures will enable the in situ monitoring of the blade and allow the blade to adapt to changing wind loadings Smart structures are those which apply an array of sensors to continuously monitor the state of the structure and are capable of using those sensors to appropriately react to achieve a desired state. This paper will examine the application of smart structures to the wind energy industry. It will be shown that a fiber optic, Fiber Bragg Grating sensor is the best type of sensor for wind energy. One of the main contributing factors is the capability of the sensors to multiplex, which means many sensors can be located along a single optical fiber and different types of sensors can be run on the same optical fiber. The blades will \'react\' to changing conditions through the use of an actuated Gurney style flap. The flap will be used to shed the wind loads from the blade in high wind scenarios. These systems working together will provide an effective and efficient method of advancing the design of the wind turbine blade to a level appropriate for the systems expected today and in the future.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/blockey/BlockeyJ0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of local and landscape characteristics of Prairie Dog colonies on Burrowing Owl nest ecology in South Dakota</field><field name="creator">Bly, Kristy Lee Sydney</field><field name="description">In the Great Plains, sylvatic plague (Yersinia pestis), poisoning, and habitat conversion continue to reduce and fragment black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) habitat in which burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) seek shelter and nest sites. Consequently, burrowing owls are experiencing population declines at the periphery of their range. The objective of this research was to evaluate habitat factors affecting a population of burrowing owls at the eastern extent of their range. I modeled hypothesized relationships between nest density (Chapter 2) and colony productivity (Chapter 3) and prairie dog habitat characteristics at two scales on the Bad River Ranches, South Dakota. Colony size, prairie dog and total burrow density, mean nearest neighbor and mean nest-to-colony edge distances, cover of warm-season grasses, and soil texture were variables measured at the colony level. Landscape level variables included the degree of colony isolation and the topographic location of colonies. In Chapter 4, I evaluated the spatial distribution of nests within colonies. Twenty-six prairie dog colonies were surveyed for burrowing owl nests during the 2005 (n =10) and 2006 (n = 16) breeding seasons. I evaluated competing models of nest density using a likelihood cross-validation approach. The model selection results in Chapter 2 suggested the top a priori predictor of nest density was colony size. Nest density was greatest on small colonies (&lt;20 ha) and lowest on large colonies (&gt;40 ha); in contrast, owl numbers were higher on large colonies. Exploratory analysis identified the interaction between cover of bare ground and colony habitat as the best approximating model of nest density. In Chapter 3, competing models of colony productivity were assessed. Although an additive model containing the degree of isolation, habitat, and colony size had a positive effect on colony productivity, exploratory analysis suggested colony size and the degree of isolation had the strongest influence. In Chapter 4, results showed that owls displayed a strong preference for nesting near colony perimeters, but this did not translate to higher productivity. The associations I observed lend support for the value of maintaining prairie dog colonies to ensure the persistence of burrowing owl populations in the Great Plains ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bly/BlyK0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Historical inquiry and epiphany: a bridge for elementary education majors learning to design elementary art curriculum</field><field name="creator">Boehler, Kimberly Raie</field><field name="description">Theory and practice for comprehensive art education (K-8) has continued to reflect and influence reform in general education since the 1960s. Yet in spite of development of exemplary programs, art in many classrooms is often limited to experimentation with materials, providing breaks in the day for students or teachers. Teacher educators need to consider what training will enable emerging elementary teachers to become competent developers of relevant and purposeful art curriculum (for learning built on knowledge and skills unique to the arts.) The purpose of this qualitative study was to guide, observe, and report on the experiences of Elementary Education (EDEL) Majors in an Elementary Art Methods course within the Education Department at Montana State University. These students were asked to engage in historical/cultural inquiry as members of a group in order to construct contextual understanding of one artwork or art site. Then students were guided through the process of designing curriculum from their insights of the same art prompt. The unit foundation guidelines used were from the Transforming Education Through the Arts Challenge (TETAC), a five-year project completed in 2001. The framework, which emphasizes art integration, was founded on Discipline-Based Art Education (DBAE) and Understanding by Design (Wiggins and McTighe, 1998) concepts. The results of this study indicate that emerging teachers have a pre-determined idea about what art is and should be in the classroom. Most EDEL majors say they intend to teach or integrate art but many feel art should be fun activity allowing for free expression. However, when given opportunity to cultivate informed understanding of an artwork, EDEL students were able to design substantive and well-aligned curriculum with meaningful enduring ideas, essential questions, and learning objectives for art skills and knowledge. The findings will encourage educators to approach inquiry in elementary art methods as an information-gathering process appropriate for preparing to teach in any content area. The inquiry process alone did not lead EDEL students to experience epiphany until they began to unpack their ideas according to the structure for unit design.

QASR network nodes exchange node location and flow reservation data periodically to provide information necessary to model and estimate both the available bandwidth and the end-to-end delay of available routes during route discovery. Bandwidth reservation is used to provide end-to-end Quality of Service, while also utilizing the differentiated Quality of Service provided by the 802.11e link layer. We show that QASR performs significantly better in several performance metrics over the DSR and the Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocols, and performs more consistently in all quality metrics when traffic demand exceeds network capacity.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bohannan/BohannanC0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sense of Past...Sense of Place</field><field name="creator">Boland, Katherine Ellen</field><field name="description">Architecture today does not respond to memory, the essence of character. As a result, a disengagement exists between people and place. In a world of constant movement a sense of place is not only uncommon but in some instances unknown; we are continuously in a state of motion. We commonly forget why we are here, who settled the land we now inhabit. We forget that life is more than technology bombarding us at every instant; it is more than work and more than financial success. We forget that life can be more. Architecture is also in this state of constant motion, financial success is placed ahead of experience, and as a result places become indifferent, unmemorable, and apathetic. Memory must not be put to the wayside; it is the bond that connects us to our culture. It enables our will to dream. Architecture can be the means of remembering. By cueing memory through emotion and sensory detail, one is able to pause and recall past events. The dilapidation of one&amp;acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s environment can also cue memory. The act of showing the passage of time makes the past come alive. By responding to these aspects architecture becomes an indication of memory. As a result we will be connected to the land on which we live and have a reason to call that place home. We will have a heightened sense of place. Alienation and placelessness will be no more. The inevitable result of engaging memory in architecture will produce memorable spaces that inspire us, leaving us with a sense of belonging. The intention of this thesis is to illustrate that architecture is capable of unlocking memory, both collective and personal, through materials, form, and experience. This will evoke personal insights and ultimately provide memorable architecture that enhances a sense of place. As a result, we will be brought back to the days of childhood, to imagination, to a life full of meaningful events that imprint memories on the soul.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/boland/BolandK0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paleoecology and taphonomy of the Willow Tank Formation (Albian), Southern Nevada</field><field name="creator">Bonde, Joshua William</field><field name="description">This study documents fossil remains from the Willow Tank Formation and places those remains into a taphonomic and sedimentological context in order to determine the paleoecology of southern Nevada during the Early Cretaceous (Albian). Recovered taxa include Lepisosteidae, Ceratodus, Holostean A, Naomichelys, Baenidae, c.f. Adocus, possible Trionychidae, Crocodyliformes, Thyreophora, Iguanodontia, Titanosauriformes, Tyrannosauroidea, Dromaeosauridae, indet. Theropoda, and two fern morphotypes. Sedimentology of the fossiliferous unit of the Willow Tank Formation suggests these taxa were deposited in an anastomosed fluvial system. Interpretation of an anastomosed fluvial system is based in part upon an overwhelming abundance of overbank fines, single storied channel fills, lack of lateral accretion structures, and common crevasse splay sandstones. Observed paleosols commonly contain carbonate nodules associated with mottled red-green mudrocks. The carbonate nodules are consistent with as seasonally arid environment and reddening of beds may suggest a well drained floodplain. Taphonomic modes include microsite, subaqueous bonebed, subaerial bonebed, and channel fill assemblages. Vertebrate fossils are found predominantly in overbank settings. The fauna of the Willow Tank Formation most resembles that of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Unlike the discrete, temporal, fauna assemblages of the various members of the Cedar Mountain Formation, the Willow Tank Formation fauna contains a mix of these different stratigraphic faunas. One example is the co-occurrence of Early Cretaceous iguanodon-grade and Late Cretaceous hadrosaur-grade teeth. Another example being the presence of a tyrannosauroid tooth in Albian beds of the Willow Tank Formation, where tyrannosauroids are not found in the Cedar Mountain Formation until the Cenomanian.

In 1993, the lucida subspecies was listed as threatened in response to concern over the loss of forest habitats to which the owl is widely associated. However, in the northwestern corner of their range spotted owls primarily inhabit steep-walled rocky canyons. Owl populations inhabiting this region have received less attention than populations using forests, although, canyon populations are important to the persistence of the subspecies, and are subject to different environmental pressures. I investigated the breeding ecology and home range characteristics of Mexican spotted owls within Grand Canyon which supports both forest and rocky canyon habitat. During the study from 2004 - 2006, female fecundity (mean = 0.86), calculated as the number of female fledglings per paired female, was relatively high compared to values reported previously for Mexican spotted owls. Five adult male owls were radio-tracked during the breeding season. I used minimum convex polygons and fixed kernel estimates to describe home range size (mean = 356 ha and 372 ha, respectively) and generated adaptive kernels to describe areas of concentrated use within home ranges. I used GIS to describe vegetation and geology cover types associated with owl use areas. This information was used to determine if spotted owls used landscape cover types disproportionately to their availability. At a landscape level, spotted owl telemetry locations were positively correlated with pin&amp;Igrave;&#402;yon-juniper vegetation that occurred within canyons as well as with the Redwall and Muav geologic layers (p &lt;or equal to 0.05). Home ranges were located toward the heads of tributary canyons and spotted owls were rarely observed above the rim on forested plateaus. To identify nest core areas that might aid in the species conservation I delineated 40 ha "protected core areas" around spotted owl nest sites and show that these conservation zones correlated closely to areas of concentrated use I identified using an adaptive kernel (30% isopleth) home range analysis.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bowden/BowdenT0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of water temperature and angling on mortality of salmonids in Montana streams</field><field name="creator">Boyd, James W.</field><field name="description">In Montana, angling closures are used to protect salmonids from the deleterious impacts of angling at elevated water temperatures (23&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C). Catch-and-release angling (CR) studies have reported high levels (30-40%) of salmonid mortality at water temperatures &gt;20&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C, but few studies assess CR mortality of salmonids at water temperatures observed in Montana streams during mid-summer (23&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C). The primary objective of this study was to measure CR mortality of rainbow trout, brown trout, and mountain whitefish in three water temperature treatments; when daily maximum water temperatures were cool (&lt;20&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C), warm (20 to 22.9&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C), and hot (23&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C). A secondary objective was to assess CR mortality of salmonids angled in morning and evening within water temperature treatments. Based on the literature, mortality of salmonids was predicted to be &gt;30% within the hot treatment and higher in evening than morning. Angling (fly-fishing only) occurred in the Gallatin and Smith rivers. All angled fish were confined to in-stream holding cages and monitored for mortality for 72 h. Mortality of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss increased to 9% and 16% in warm and hot treatments, respectively. Mortality of brown trout Salmo trutta was (4%) in the hot treatment in the Smith River. Mountain whitefish Prosopium williamsoni had increased mortality in the warm (20%) and hot (28%) treatments in the Smith River. No mortality for any species occurred in either river when water temperatures were &lt;20&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C. Mortality of rainbow trout angled in evening was higher than morning in the warm (14%) and hot (16%) treatments in the Smith River. Laboratory results indicated rainbow trout stressed in evening had higher mortality (7%) than those stressed in morning (0%). Angler catch rates were lower for most species in evening than morning angling events; however, catch rates remained high (0.7 fish/h) in several evening angling events. Study results indicate that salmonid mortality rates associated with catch-and-release fly-fishing are higher at elevated (&gt;or equal to 23&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C) water temperatures. Although there was a relationship between elevated water temperature and salmonid mortality, most of the mortality estimates were well below the 30% mortality that was predicted.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/boyd/BoydJ0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Axial capacity of piles supported on intermediate geomaterials</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Heather Margaret</field><field name="description">Pile foundations used to support bridges and other structures are designed and installed to sustain axial and lateral loads without failing in bearing capacity and without undergoing excessive movements. The axial load-carrying capacity of a driven pile is derived from friction or adhesion along the pile shaft and by compressive resistance at the pile tip. There are well established analytical methods for evaluating pile capacity and for predicting pile driving characteristics for cohesive soil, cohesionless soil, and rock. However, past experience indicates these methods may not be reliable for piles driven into intermediate geomaterials (IGMs), which often exhibit a wide array of properties with characteristics ranging from stiff or hard soil to soft weathered rock. Methods to determine the axial capacity, driving resistance, and long-term resistance of piles driven into intermediate geomaterials are not well established. Nine projects, in which piles were driven into IGMs, from the Montana Department of Transportation were analyzed. Each project contained information from CAPWAP dynamic analyses, construction records, and design reports. The purpose of any analyses, of the nine projects, was to better predict the behavior of piles in IGMs. IGMs were divided into two broad types, cohesive and cohesionless. The computer program DRIVEN is often used to predict the axial capacities of piles&amp;Iacute;&amp;frac34; however, in IGMs the design method is unreliable. Attempts were made to determine trends within the available data. Normalized resistances for shaft and toe capacities did yield slight correlations of shaft resistance to pile length in IGMs. Iterative solutions using DRIVEN to match the CAPWAP ultimate capacity did not provide meaningful trends or correlations. Slight modification of MDT\'s original DRIVEN inputs was required in most cases to match the CAPWAP ultimate capacity. Because no meaningful trends were found from analysis, other capacity calculation methods were used to determine other methods that accurately predict pile capacity within IGMs. The Washington Department of Transportation Gates formula is the most accurate method of those attempted. More research is required for further analysis of piles in IGMs.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/brooks/BrooksH0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding new representations in science and natural history film through a deconstruction of televised weather forcasting</field><field name="creator">Brown, Parker Brandt</field><field name="description">Broadcast television networks limit their representation of the weather by embedding weather forecasting with ideologies of science, capitalism, and patriarchy, thereby creating a dispassionate monolithic regime as the totalizing representation of weather in popular media. This is not to say that TV weather forecasting is not useful, but that it is a narrowly focused scientific representation of nature, and as such denies experiences of the weather beyond utilitarian prediction. Non-fiction film employs a set of representational tools that, when applied to the weather, can deconstruct the mainstream representation of the weather and create alternative representations that reconnect viewers with their personal experiences of the weather. Non-fiction film allows filmmakers the freedom to directly author messages and choose systems of signs that deconstruct the mainstream broadcast of the weather. It can restore an assumption of afilmic representation and allow viewers the ability to interpret the weather in their own contexts. These ideas led to the production of my own film, Weatherscape, which simultaneously re-contextualizes the weather to encourage the viewer to create his or her own weather experience and critiques the TV weather representation. Deconstruction through non-fiction film proves to be a robust tool for creating representations that rethink our portrayal of nature.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/brown/BrownP1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeochemistry and hydrology of three alpine proglacial environments resulting from glacier retreat</field><field name="creator">Bruckner, Monica Zanzola</field><field name="description">Proglacial environments, formed by glacier retreat, exhibit distinct characteristics in discharge, water temperature, water residence time, and dissolved ion, carbon, and suspended sediment concentrations. The unnamed alpine glacier at the headwaters of the Wheaton River, Yukon, Canada, provides an ideal setting to compare deglaciation processes that result in three different proglacial environments. The glacier has evolved from occupying one large catchment (~4 km 2) to two smaller catchments (each ~2 km 2) via glacier thinning and net mass loss, forming two lobes separated by a medial moraine. Field observations revealed neither crevasses nor evidence of subglacial drainage outlets and suggested this glacier had a non-temperate thermal regime with meltwater predominantly flowing from supraglacial and ice marginal sources. Climate and bedrock geology were similar for the subcatchments, providing a natural laboratory to compare deglaciation processes. This study compared the hydrology and biogeochemistry of three outlet streams from this glacier: one stream drained a proglacial lake which is fed by meltwater from the lower west lobe, a second stream drained the upper west lobe, and a third stream was the major drainage outlet for the east lobe. Hydrologic monitoring over the 2006 melt season (June-August) and analyses of water samples for dissolved ion content and carbon indicated that the meltwaters are dominated by Ca 2+ and HCO 3-, which are derived from biogeochemical weathering of crustal materials. The study demonstrated that the presence of the proglacial lake, which acted as a meltwater reservoir, measurably modified meltwater residence time, water temperature, water chemistry, and bacterial biomass relative to the proglacial streams. Rock:water interaction between meltwater and medial morainal sediment and fine-grained, reactive glacial flour suspended in the streams and the lake water column also enhanced biogeochemical weathering within the catchment. Thus, this study provided a small-scale example for how differences in proglacial environments and water flow paths affect headwater hydrology and biogeochemistry. This study was the first of its kind in the Coast Mountains, Yukon, Canada, and results presented here aid in the understanding of how proglacial environments created by climate-induced glacier retreat affect hydrochemistry, hydrology, and carbon dynamics in remote high elevation environments.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/bruckner/BrucknerM1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Process voltage temperature compensated on-chip CMOS active inductors for Wilkinson power dividing applications</field><field name="creator">Bucossi, William Louis</field><field name="description">Few academic or industry feasibility studies have been published on the implementation of Active Inductors in a standard CMOS IC process as an alternative to the physically large and typically quite lossy spiral inductors.

In my opinion, this is the most important way I can describe myself as a person. As a son, brother, friend, employee, and student my Faith undeniably affects every facet of my life. In an effort to make my last year as a student resonate on a personal level, I have combined my spiritual journey with my academic one. My intent was to characterize my Christian faith in order to introduce an architecture that embodies the duality of a personal connection to God and a community experience based on fellowship. My ten-week investigation of my beliefs, the Christian church, and architectural precedents has pointed me towards designing a remote worship destination in an effort to explore the intersection that occurs between the spiritual and earthly realms and between the individual and society. My hope is that this design will embody my concept of the Christian faith as a process, or journey, and the nature of that process causing a spiritual separation from society. My intention is to symbolically represent a journey, a point of rest and introspection, and to capture the nature of worship with an architecture and how that architecture responds to a site. My process thus far has been incredibly introspective and educational on so much more than an academic plane. My early research was fueled by cynicism and frustration with how I have seen the Christian faith and church represented in America today. However, diving deeper into the spirituality of Christian worship I have gained a beautiful perspective on our relationship with God and each other. I can only hope that my solution will reflect the spiritual growth I have experienced. If you want to make God laugh, tell Him your plans.

Recently, the use of winter wheat as a trap crop to protect spring wheat from this insect pest in a wheat-fallow cropping system was evaluated, yielding promising results. Subsequently, the overall objective of this dissertation research was to improve the efficacy of winter wheat trap crops to manage the WSS. Oviposition behavior studies in the presence of hosts infested by conspecifics showed that WSS did not avoid infested hosts. These results confirmed the potential of a trap to provide a sink for multiple eggs, resulting in increased WSS mortality due to cannibalism. I identified suitable winter wheat cultivars based on agronomic characteristics that influence WSS behavior in conjunction with the emission of behaviorally active plant volatiles, as well as the performance of the cultivars in the area where the pest occurs. Results from this study identified five cultivars, Norstar, Morgan, BigSky, Neeley, and Rampart, with good potential as trap crops. Norstar emitted greater amounts of attractive volatile compound &amp;Atilde;&#376;-ocimene, and was the preferred host in greenhouse choice tests. Based on these results, a perimeter trap cropping trial comparing three winter cultivars as traps (Norstar, Neeley and Rampart) to protect spring wheat was conducted for two consecutive years. Two spring wheat cultivars differing in suitability for infestation by sawflies were chosen as the main crop. WSS abundance was significantly greater in the winter wheat traps than in the adjacent unattractive spring cultivar Conan both years of the experiment and greater than an attractive spring cultivar Reeder in 2005. No differences in infestation were observed between winter cultivars, although greater numbers of eggs were found in Norstar than in Rampart traps. Swathing the trap crop before grain fill killed most larvae developing in the trap crop. Finally, I investigated the effect of a synthetic attractive compound, (Z)-3-hexenylacetate, on oviposition and found that application of this compound in a lanolin paste resulted in increased oviposition by females in greenhouse choice tests. The results obtained suggest that a trap cropping management strategy involving attractive and unattractive cultivars, and semiochemically assisted trap cropping by application of synthetic host volatiles, show potential to manage the WSS.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/buteler/ButelerM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religion and public order in the 1790's</field><field name="creator">Callaway, Patrick Michael</field><field name="description">The connection between the founders and relationship between church and state has become increasingly important in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. Entire books are regularly published on the private religious thoughts and practices of many of the founding fathers; often times these works exist in order to support a closer relationship between Christian practice and piety and the government. Just as often, published works also draw on the ideas of the same founders in order to support a more concrete separation between religious thought and practice and governance. These "culture wars" are an emotive part of the present day political discourse; however, this thesis argues that attempts to fight the culture wars though the thought of the founders is factually erroneous and misguided because the context of the founders and their debates have been overly simplified or just plain lost. The link between religion and the political culture of the 1790s was a practical matter of governance and support for a larger ideal of consensus, not an expression of cultural preference as is common in present-day political discourse. The connection between the governing structure under the Constitution, a blessing upon that government from God, and the inculcation of Christian ideals into the public that support both religion and the government became increasingly important as the range of political and social opinions expanded in the 1790s. Contemporary political thought that places the intent of the founders at the center of political debate ignore the significant divisions among the founders' political, philosophical, and religious ideals. There is little unity in thought among the founders; they virulently disagreed about religion, politics, and the connection between them. Arguing the present day culture wars through the lens of the founders is emotive and politically effective, but without a full appreciation for the larger historical and intellectual contexts of the early republic and the concerns particular to that time an appeal to the wisdom of the founders on religion and its connection to American politics, this claim to political legitimacy is of dubious intellectual validity.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/callaway/CallawayP1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Satellite monitoring of current and historical development patterns in Big Sky, Montana: 1990-2005</field><field name="creator">Campos, Natalie Monique</field><field name="description">The goal of this study was to map current and historical development patterns in Big Sky, Montana. Object-oriented classifications of a high-resolution Quickbird image and a fused Quickbird and LiDAR image were compared. Results demonstrated that object-oriented classification can be used to overcome the difficulty associated with pixel-based classification of high-resolution images through the addition of contextual metrics to the classification process. The fused classification resulted in decreased errors of commission and omission for each class, but the differences between the classifications were not statistically significant. The fused classification represented the shapes of land cover objects more precisely based on visual assessment. Temporal analysis of land cover patterns was accomplished successfully by using a generalized version of the fused classification to map historical development. Previous research on multitemporal mapping of multiresolution images has been lacking. Our research showed that the generalization of a high-resolution classification can be used as training data for a historical image. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image differencing and boosted classification trees were used to identify and classify areas of change. This resulted in the successful identification of temporal changes in land cover due to Mountain Resort Development (MRD). Statistical pattern analysis revealed correlations between MRD and the variables distance-to-streams, distance-to-roads, slope, and aspect. Forest changes were found to be disproportionately located farther away from streams and on lower slopes. Grassland changes disproportionately occurred closer to steams, but overall grassland change was proportional to grassland land cover in 1990. Classification tree analysis indicated the variables distance-to-streams, distance-to-roads, slope, and aspect explained 87% of the variance for the change classes and might be related to amenity development. There was an increase in impervious surfaces and a decrease in both forests and grassland areas between the years 1990-2005. Loss of forest and grassland area can result in increased habitat fragmentation and can have negative consequences for ecosystems within the areas. Overall, this project successfully mapped both current and historical development patterns in Big Sky, Montana. This allowed for statistical pattern analysis of variables that have been shown to be correlated with MRD.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/campos/CamposN0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When does ostracism decrease self-regulation</field><field name="creator">Carter, Brett Edward</field><field name="description">Previous research in social psychology has suggested that ostracism has a negative impact on SE, and also can affect how much food individuals will consume. Moreover, research in the eating disorders literature shows a negative relationship between self-esteem and eating. As such, the present experiment was designed to merge these two lines of research to examine what causal role, if any, self-esteem plays in men\'s and women\'s food consumption. It was proposed that some individuals should show a lack of self regulation in terms of the type and amount of food eaten following ostracism. It was also predicted that this effect would have some possible moderators. To test this prediction, participants were randomly assigned to either an ostracism or inclusion condition within the computer game Cyberball. Results indicated that the ostracism manipulation did not result in the anticipated decrease in SE status nor did it cause any significant changes in eating behavior. Nevertheless, significant correlations between SE and body dissatisfaction (BD) were observed, as well as between BD and appearance based rejection sensitivity. There were also significant correlations between body mass index (BMI) and BD, as well as between SE and ARS in both genders. There was also a significant correlation between SE and BMI, but only for male participants. Exploratory analyses revealed that there may have been an unforeseen impact of experimenter gender on eating behavior post ostracism such that self presentation may have impacted the manner in which individuals responded to ostracism.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/carter/CarterB0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, fabrication, and testing of the van der Pauw piezoresistive structure for pressure sensing</field><field name="creator">Cassel, Robert Douglas</field><field name="description">The project characterizes a piezoresistive sensor under variations of both size and orientation with respect to the silicon crystal lattice for its application to MEMS pressure sensing. The sensor to be studied is a four-terminal piezoresistive sensor commonly referred to as a van der Pauw (VDP) structure. The VDP sensor is used primarily in sheet resistance measurements, but has also been determined to be useful in determining the stress components at a point on (100) and (111) silicon wafer surfaces. In a previous study, our team has determined the relation between the biaxial stress state at a point and the piezoresistive response of the VDP by combining the VDP resistance equations with the equations governing silicon piezoresistivity. It was found that the theoretical sensitivity of the VDP sensor is over three times higher than the conventional filament type resistor. With MEMS devices being used in applications which continually necessitate smaller size, understanding the effect of size on VDP performance is important. In order to test the validity of the theoretical calculations which were done by our group, appropriate devices were manufactured on a (100) silicon test wafer. The wafer was designed to have numerous pressure sensitive diaphragms which can reliably sustain a pressure difference of approximately 50kPa. Each diaphragm was doped with a VDP or other sensor designed to test the sensitivity of the VDP vs. a certain parameter. These parameters include size, misalignment, and diaphragm position, in addition to the comparison of sensitivity to conventional sensor types. A test strip was also included in the design in order to determine an empirical relationship between stress and resistance. In testing the VDP devices for comparison with conventional sensor types, it was found that the VDP devices had a linear response as expected, were the most sensitive, and provided a number of additional advantages. Specifically, the VDP device allows for significant miniaturization, because its resistance value is independent of size, and the measurement technique is independent of line resistance. The simple geometry of the VDP also simplifies fabrication.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/cassel/CasselR0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein-Protein interactions involved in the biogenesis of eukaryotic small ribosomal subunits</field><field name="creator">Castle, Cathy Lynn</field><field name="description">Ribosome biogenesis is a complicated process involving numerous proteins and modification factors. The process has been well-documented in prokaryotic cells where it is much less complex than the process involved in eukaryotic cells. In eukaryotes, much of what is known about ribosome biogenesis has been learned from studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Far less has been learned about higher eukaryotes such as humans. However, among organisms in all three domains of life, ribosome structure and function is well conserved. The biogenesis of ribosomal subunits is dynamic, complicated, and, in S. cerevisiae, requires over 200 trans-acting factors for synthesis to occur. The focus of this study is synthesis of the small ribosome subunit in eukaryotes. In order to study this process in higher eukaryotes, a mammalian cell culture method was used. This method involves cloning human ribosomal accessory genes using the Gateway system, a rapid and efficient cloning method that permits parallel construction of numerous plasmids in a modular type of system, each containing the desired gene of interest in a variety of vectors. Proteins were selected based on their activity in yeast with emphasis on the final processing step of the small subunit and the proteins that are involved at that step. These proteins are Nob1p, Enp1p, Tsr1p, Rio2p, Rrp20p, Dim1p, and Hrr25p. The corresponding genes were cloned into vectors containing either the coding region for a full-length fluorescent protein or the C-terminus or N-terminus half of the fluorescent protein. The bimolecular fluorescent complementation assay (BiFC) was then utilized to detect protein-protein interactions. Results of this assay demonstrate binary interactions among pairs of this group of proteins and the location within the cell where these interactions take place.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/castle/CastleC1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A 3D computer model investigation of biofilm detachment and protection mechanisms</field><field name="creator">Chambless, Jason Daniel</field><field name="description">A biofilm is a dense aggregation of microorganisms attached to each other and a supporting surface. Biofilms are ubiquitous in industrial environments and are also frequently recognized as the source of persistent infections. Biofilm invasions and biofilm-induced infections are often difficult or impossible to remedy. This dissertation presents the results of a 3D hybrid computer model, BacLAB, which was used to simulate detachment and protection mechanisms of biofilms in a cellular automata framework. Protection against antimicrobials afforded by each of four hypothesized protective mechanisms was investigated in order to examine population survival versus antimicrobial exposure time, and the spatial patterns of chemical species and cell types. When compared to each other, the behaviors of the slow penetration, adaptive stress response, substrate limitation, and persister mechanisms produced distinct shapes of killing curves, non-uniform spatial patterns of survival and cell type distribution, and anticipated susceptibility patterns of dispersed biofilm cells. Detachment is an important process that allows an organism the possibility of traveling to and colonizing a new location. Detachment also balances growth and so determines the net accumulation of biomass on the surface. Three hypothetical mechanisms representing various physical and biological influences of detachment were incorporated into BacLAB. The purpose of this investigation was to characterize each of the mechanisms with respect to four criteria: the resulting biofilm structure, the existence of a steady state, the propensity for sloughing events, and the dynamics during starvation. The results showed that varying the detachment mechanism is a critical determinant of biofilm structure and of the dynamics of biofilm accumulation and loss. Phenotypic variants, in the form of dormant cells, can often survive an antimicrobial treatment. The existence of these cells, termed persisters, is one hypothetical explanation for biofilm recalcitrance. Four different combinations of random and substrate-dependant persister mechanisms were simulated through the use of the BacLAB model. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the effects of differing formation and resuscitation strategies on persister-related protection of biofilms. Analysis of the simulations showed that extended periods of dormancy, without regard to the mechanism, were directly responsible for more tolerant biofilms.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/chambless/ChamblessJ0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk effects in elk (Cervus elaphus): behavioral and nutritional responses to wolves and environmental conditions</field><field name="creator">Christianson, David Alan</field><field name="description">Until recently, predators have been though to regulate prey primarily through direct predation, in ecosystems where top down effects have been shown to be important. However, experiments and recent empirical observations show that the costs of antipredator responses in individuals that successfully avoid predation can exert equal or larger driving forces on population dynamics than the numerical effect of direct predation. Such a mechanism has not been explored in a large terrestrial vertebrate. I explored the antipredator responses of elk (Cervus elaphus) to wolves (Canis lupus) in the Upper Gallatin Canyon of southwest Montana, USA, December through May in the winters of 2003-2006. First I reviewed elk winter diet studies to understand what drives elk foraging behavior. Next I modeled the consequences of diet shifts in grazing and browsing on mass dynamics in wintering female elk. I also developed a new nutritional index, fecal chlorophyll, that I used primarily between winter and spring periods of nutrition as foraging constraints (and costs of antipredator response) would be quite different between these two periods. Specifically, I measured foraging behavior, diet selection, and nutrient balance in wintering elk and monitored daily predation risk as wolves moved naturally, in and out of four creek drainages that formed the primary winter range. Elk showed great sensitivity to fine-scale descriptions of wolf predation risk in nearly every response variable. In particular, adult female elk increased browsing on woody stems, sagebrush, and confers while adult males showed the opposition response and increased grazing on days when wolves were present in the same drainage. This work implies that predator may in fact play a large role in ecosystems including ecosystems where predators were deemed non-influential and bottom up effects important.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/christianson/ChristiansonD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating tools to educate and engage:  how interactive media can aid in scientific understanding</field><field name="creator">Citrola, Penny</field><field name="description">A well-educated citizenry, armed with an awareness of science and technological principles, is vital to the success of our society.

This environmental isolate was obtained from an outbreak in Gideon, MO, and was classified as Salmonella enterica serotype Missouri. Gene expression profiles obtained from this environmental isolate were compared with profiles of the ATCC type strain Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium LT2 grown under the same conditions. It was shown that there were distinct transcriptional differences in both of the strains between the biofilm and planktonic phenotypes. Both strains exhibited the strong up-regulation of several gene pathways that were unique to the biofilm phenotype. These included genes responsible for the cobalamin-dependent anaerobic utilization of 1,2-propanediol (cob-cbi-pdu), type III secretion system apparatus and effector proteins located on Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI-2) and the well characterized csg operon largely responsible for biofilm formation in Salmonella. A significant proportion of the genes present on the virulence plasmid PSLT were shown to be exclusively up-regulated in the biofilm phenotype of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2, illustrating the tendency of this pathogen to exhibit a promiscuous lifestyle whilst in the non-host environment. It was further demonstrated that the environmental isolate exhibited a more tenacious biofilm-forming tendency and overall greater survivability than the type strain in a low nutrient, non-host environment. It appeared from the transcriptional profile of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 during planktonic growth that the organism struggled to adapt and survive under low nutrient conditions as evidenced by the increased expression of ribosomal subunit operons rps and rpl and several stress-related genes including dnaK and htp. The conclusion may be drawn that Salmonella Missouri has developed several key systems differentiating the biofilm and planktonic phenotypes and affording it a competitive advantage. While some of these traits have previously been studied exclusively in the context of host pathogenicity, this research indicates that perhaps these so-called virulence strategies may afford the pathogen enhanced survival in non-host environments as well. Therefore, these findings suggest that the use of excessively sub-cultured laboratory strains may be inappropriate surrogates for studying the behavior of real-world pathogens.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/clark/ClarkS0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caregiver perceptions of children\'s risks associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke</field><field name="creator">Coloff, Kelly Ann</field><field name="description">The detrimental health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke are well researched and documented. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure has especially toxic effects on the respiratory health of young children. Children exposed to larger doses and for longer periods of time may suffer more severe consequences. Despite this compelling scientific data, evidence suggests that adults do not accurately recognize the risks of environmental tobacco smoke exposure. Therefore, children continue to be exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in their home environments. Through clean air legislation in all 50 states, environmental tobacco smoke exposure is partially regulated in public places. This does not, however, protect children from threats of environmental tobacco smoke exposure in private residences. The purpose of this study was to describe how caregivers of rural-dwelling children perceive the children\'s risks associated with environmental tobacco smoke. Two aspects of the Health Belief Model, perceived susceptibility and perceived severity, were utilized in evaluating caregiver risk perceptions related to environmental tobacco smoke exposure. Data were selected from survey results gathered through the Environmental Risk Reduction through Nursing Intervention and Evaluation (ERRNIE) project. Survey results for rural, low-income caregivers (n = 31) residing in Gallatin County, Montana were included in this analysis. The scores reflected in the survey results indicate that knowledge regarding environmental tobacco smoke exposure risks is moderate in this population. Caregivers sense that environmental tobacco smoke may be harmful, but they do not report a high level of concern regarding the detrimental effects of environmental tobacco smoke exposure for their own children. Data from this study is consistent with other documented research suggesting that, despite available information, caregivers do not accurately perceive the true severity of environmental tobacco smoke exposure. The results of this descriptive study, nested within the larger ERRNIE project, indicate the need for further studies encompassing a larger sample size and an expanded geographic range. This study directs the focus of interventions at modifying risk perceptions of environmental tobacco smoke exposure to promote behavior change. Empowering caregivers with knowledge that may lead to behavior change is the key to enabling children to thrive in healthy environments.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/coloff/ColoffK0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive presence among mathematics teachers: an analysis of tasks and discussions in an asynchronous online graduate course</field><field name="creator">Colt, Diana Lynn</field><field name="description">Higher order learning, in terms of both process and outcome, is frequently cited as the goal of higher education (Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer, 2000). However, the adoption of computer mediated communication in higher education has far outpaced our understanding of how this medium can best be used to promote higher order learning (Garrison, Anderson, &amp; Archer, 2004). Researchers have examined quantitative components of computer mediated communication, but little work has been done to examine the cognitive aspects of online discussion. Those studies that do exist demonstrate inconsistent evidence of higher order learning in online discussions (Kanuka &amp; Anderson, 1998; Littleton &amp; Whitelock, 2005; McLoughlin &amp; Luca, 2000; Meyer, 2003). Researchers conjecture that this could be due to the nature of the tasks that instructors implement for discussion purposes (Arnold &amp; Ducate, 2006; Meyer, 2004; Murphy, 2004; Vonderwell, 2003). This study explored whether one component of instruction, the tasks assigned to students, had an effect on the level of cognitive presence that existed in the mathematical discussions of practicing mathematics teachers enrolled in an online graduate course. Through the method of content analysis, discussion transcripts were analyzed to look for evidence of higher-order learning based on the cognitive presence coding protocol developed by Garrison, Anderson, and Archer (2001). Seventeen students in a History of Mathematics course form the primary sample for this study. The results of the content analysis were triangulated with qualitative data from a questionnaire on student backgrounds and demographics and a post-course survey assessing student perceptions of their learning experiences. The researcher concluded that the MATH 500 course discussions did provide evidence of higher order learning in terms of cognitive presence. Task type, as defined in this study, was not directly related to the levels of cognitive presence achieved in the course. This finding does not negate the possibility of such a relationship, but in this study the effects of task type could not be isolated from other features of the course structure and assignments.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/colt/ColtD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From East to West: an exploratory cross cultural comparison of night eating syndrome and related eating pathology in Mainland China and the USA</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Barbara Ellen</field><field name="description">The current study investigates the prevalence rate of Night Eating Syndrome (NES) in mainland China. Although some research has investigated the prevalence and characteristics of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in China, virtually no research has been carried out on NES in the indigenous Chinese population. Thus, the primary goal of the current study was to examine NES prevalence and characteristics in China and to compare these prevalence rates and characteristics to published prevalence rates for the USA and also to a sample of college students in the USA. NES has also been linked to various other characteristics of eating pathology so the current study examined these facets as they have received inadequate attention in mainland China. Participants completed survey packets that contained the following measures: Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Night Eating History and Inventory (NEHI), Eating and Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), and the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). NES prevalence in the Chinese sample was found to be greater than rates for the US and for other countries. However, the NEQ may not be a valid measure for NES screening in the Chinese population. Seven of the 21 participants scoring above the NEQ cut-off, indicating likely cases of clinically diagnosable NES, also met the criteria for anorexia nervosa and one met the criteria for bulimia nervosa. Prevalence of other eating pathological symptomatology in the Chinese sample, such as anorexia nervosa, was also higher than reported rates for American Caucasians. With adjusted body mass index (BMI) norms for China, prevalence of obesity in the Chinese sample was much lower than the rates reported for Americans even though the Chinese participants overall reported consuming foods at a much greater frequency per week.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/cooper/CooperB0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of slope aspect on the formation of surface hoar and diurnally recrystalized near-surface faceted crystals</field><field name="creator">Cooperstein, Michael Stephen</field><field name="description">This research was conducted to determine if slope aspect played a role in the formation, size and shape of surface hoar and near-surface faceted crystals and on the meteorological variables that are known to result in the formation of these two weak layers.

This thesis explores architecture that reveals those processes, not subdues them. A prime example of this is the area along the North Platte River in southeastern Wyoming. The area\'s quick settlement has resulted in poor land development that threatens the area\'s current, agriculture-dependant, livelihood. Reservoirs developed to support the agricultural industry have reached the end of their useful lives, and now threaten the water supply. Once such reservoir, located in Guernsey, Wyoming, is silting and must be removed. In the early 1900\'s, society built whatever was necessary to maintain its livelihood. It was about building quickly and controlling the forces of nature. But that approach caused problems that need to be repaired. With a new land use strategy for the river, and strategic localized site planning, architecture will be a solution. Rather than spending millions of dollars dredging the reservoir, architecture can ignite a series of positive land development. Architecture provides mankind with historical insight. It is a way for people to interact with nature and visualize an environment\'s effect over time. In order for people to integrate with nature, they must be aware of the processes that shape a place. To fully integrate architecture into the landscape, four points must be considered: the current conditions, the history, a new use for the land, and the implementation and integration of all these aspects.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/cuthbertson/CuthbertonJ0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial interactions with arsenite, hydrogen and sulfide in an acid-sulfate-chloride geothermal spring</field><field name="creator">D\'Imperio, Seth</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis investigated the importance of hydrogen, sulfide and arsenite in microbial community structure and function within a model Acid-Sulfate-Chloride (ASC) spring in Yellowstone National Park. Previous studies in this spring found that microbial arsenite [As(III)] oxidation is absent in regions of the spring outflow channel where H2S exceeds ~5 &amp;Icirc;&amp;frac14;M. Ex situ assays with microbial mat samples demonstrated immediate As(III) oxidation activity when H2S was absent or in low concentrations, suggesting the presence of functional As(III) oxidase enzymes in regions of the spring where arsenite oxidation had not been previously observed. Cultivation efforts resulted in the isolation of an As(III)-oxidizing chemolithotroph phylogenetically related to the &amp;Icirc;&amp;plusmn;-proteobacterium Acidicaldus. H2S concentration appeared to be the most important constraint on spatial distribution of this organism. This was verified with pure culture modeling and kinetic experiments.  Additionally, a study is presented that addresses the relative importance of dissolved hydrogen and sulfide for primary production in the same spring. Throughout the outflow channel where these gases could be detected, biological H2S consumption rates exceeded those of H2 by at least three orders of magnitude. Molecular analysis showed that Hydrogenobaculum-like organisms dominate the microbial community in this region of the spring. Culturing efforts resulted in 30 Hydrogenobaculum isolates belonging to three distinct 16S rRNA gene phylotypes. The isolates varied with respect to electron donor (H2S, H2) and oxygen tolerance and requirement. These metabolic physiologies are consistent with in situ geochemical conditions. An isolate representative of the dominant 16S phylotype was used as a model organism for controlled studies to determine whether an organism capable of utilizing either of these substrates demonstrated preference for H2S or H2, or whether either electron donor exerted regulatory effects on the other. The organism studied utilized both H2S and H2 simultaneously and at rates roughly comparable to those measured in the ex situ field assays. Major conclusions drawn from this study are that phylogeny cannot be relied upon to predict physiology, and that, in ASC springs, H2S clearly dominates H2 as an energy source, both in terms of availability and apparent consumption rates.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/d'imperio/D'ImperioS0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of coalbed natural gas development on fish assemblages in tributary streams in the Powder River Basin, Montana and Wyoming</field><field name="creator">Davis, Windy Niccole</field><field name="description">The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana is undergoing the world's largest development of coalbed natural gas (CBNG) extraction. Potential exists for substantial effects on aquatic ecosystems because CBNG development involves production and disposal of large quantities of CBNG product water that differs from surface waters and alters natural flow regimes. In 2005 and 2006, I compared fish assemblages in streams with (treatment) and without (control) CBNG development, determined fish presence, growth, and survival in streams composed entirely of product water, and compared fish assemblages at multiple points above and below development to determine the effects of coalbed natural gas development on fish assemblages in the Powder River Basin. Some evidence suggested CBNG development had little or no effect on fish. For example, species richness and index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores were similar between developed and undeveloped sites, and no strong relationships existed between overall IBI scores or most IBI metric scores and the number or density of CBNG wells in a drainage area. Streams composed largely or entirely of product water were inhabited by reproducing populations of several species of fish. Other evidence suggested that CBNG may negatively affect fish assemblages over time. Conductivity was on average higher in treatment streams and was negatively related to biotic integrity. Bicarbonate, one of the primary salts in product water, appeared to be harmful to some species of fish. One salt-tolerant non-native species, northern plains killifish, was observed almost exclusively in treatment streams. The study was limited by a lack of pre-development data, unquantifiable product-water discharges, and because it was conducted during dry years. Potential effects of CBNG development may be more apparent during wet years when more sensitive fish assemblages are present. Monitoring efforts, development of a bicarbonate water quality standard, and efforts towards requiring complete product-water discharge reporting should continue.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/davis/DavisW0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal patterns of antimicrobial action against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms</field><field name="creator">Davison, William Marshall</field><field name="description">This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of antimicrobial action against Staphylococcus epidermidis planktonic and biofilm bacteria. Bacteria were stained with a fluorogenic esterase substrate, Calcein-AM, which allowed for the visualization of cells that possessed intact cell membranes. Four different antimicrobial agents were tested for their effect upon cell viability as associated with membrane integrity. The four biocides were Barquat&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;, glutaraldehyde, chlorine, and nisin. Planktonic bacteria were analyzed with flow cytometry, observing fluorescence loss during 1 h antimicrobial treatment. Treatment with Barquat resulted in initial fluorescence loss, which increased during the treatment period to levels which were present prior to the introduction of biocide, along with a decrease in cell density. Treatments with glutaraldehyde and chlorine resulted in increased average fluorescence intensity for the cell population, accompanied by decreased cell density for chlorine and increased cell density for glutaraldehyde. Nisin treatment resulted in a decrease in CAM fluorescence with an increase in cell density. Viable cell plate counts showed average log reductions in CFU/mL of 3.61, 3.83, 4.12, 4.26, and 4.67 for Barquat, glutaraldehyde, high and low concentrations of chlorine, and nisin treatments, respectively. There was no apparent correlation between plate counts and flow cytometry data. Biofilm bacteria were analyzed with time-lapse confocal scanning laser microscopy, observing fluorescence loss during biocide treatment. Biofilms treated with Barquat lost an average of 91.5% of their initial fluorescence, and clusters decreased in areal coverage by 9%. Fluorescence loss during Barquat treatment suggested the presence of a tolerant subpopulation of bacteria in the interior regions of the biofilm. Glutaraldehyde treatment reduced the average fluorescence by 16%, and cluster area did not change. There was CTC staining after glutaraldehyde treatment only. The high and low concentrations of chlorine treatment showed averages of 100% and 79% reductions in CAM staining, with liquefaction of biomass causing erosion events which reduced areal coverage by 90% and 43%, respectively. Nisin treatment reduced CAM staining by an average of 100%, while shrinking the cluster area by 8%. Corner biofilms showed qualitative differences during treatment than isolated clusters. Mathematically-predicted biocide diffusion times were much faster than experimentally observed fluorescence loss in biofilms.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/davison/DavisonW0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differences between doctoral level nurse practitioner programs and master level nurse practitioner programs as reflected in the terminal objectives and curricular patterns</field><field name="creator">Dea, John Edwin III</field><field name="description">This study examined differences between doctoral level nurse practitioner programs and master\'s level prepared nurse practitioner programs as reflected in the terminal objectives and curricular patterns. The American Association of Colleges of Nursing\'s (AACN) decision in October 2004 led to adoption of the goal to have preparation in advanced nursing occur at the doctorate level (Doctorate of Nursing Practice or DNP). Other forces driving the DNP are increasing acuity of health problems, an aging population, increasing uninsured individuals and shortage of nursing faculty. Nursing educators must be proactive in meeting these challenges by preparing advanced practice providers with the necessary education and skills. The design of this study was a cross-sectional survey conducted between January 16 and February 10, 2008. Twenty DNP programs and thirty masters programs were randomly selected. The survey was developed in a Snap9&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; program and was sent by email to be completed on line. Survey results indicated higher numbers of required clinical hours correlated with higher pass rates in the board examinations. Additional credit hours were also found to result in higher pass rates. The study also indicated differences in the terminal objectives in master\'s programs compared to doctoral programs utilizing the Cognitive domain in Bloom\'s taxonomy.

Typically these applications are composed of a large number of distributed components and it is important to meet the computational power and network bandwidth requirements of those components and their interactions. However satisfying these requirements in a large-scale, shared, heterogeneous, and highly dynamic distributed environment is a significant challenge. As systems and applications grow in scale and complexity, attaining the desired level of performance in this uncertain environment using current approaches based on global knowledge, centralized scheduling and manual reallocation becomes infeasible. This dissertation focuses on the modeling of the application and underlying architecture into a common abstraction and on the incorporations of autonomic features into those abstractions to achieve self-managed deployment. In particular, we developed techniques for automatically identifying application components and their estimated resource requirements within an application and used them in order to model the application into a graph abstraction. We also developed techniques that allow the distributed resources to self-organize in a utility-aware way while assuming minimal knowledge about the system. Finally, to achieve self-managed deployment of application components to the distributed nodes, we designed a scalable and adaptive scheduling algorithm which is governed by a utility function. The utility function, which combines several application and system level attributes, governs both the initial deployment of the application components and their reconfigurations despite the dynamism and uncertainty associated with the computing environment. The experimental results show that it is possible to achieve and maintain efficient deployment by applying the utility function derived in this paper based solely on locally available information and without costly global communication or synchronization. The self-management is therefore decentralized and provides better adaptability, scalability and robustness.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/deb/DebD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do carbohydrates increase the magnitude of the inflammatory response?</field><field name="creator">Depner, Chris Michael</field><field name="description">Inflammation is the body's response to tissue damage and infection and is correlated with several chronic diseases like type II diabetes. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins with multiple functions including control of inflammation. Cytokines are influenced by several factors such as carbohydrate intake and exercise. Thus, carbohydrate intake and exercise can influence inflammation. Purpose: To determine the influence of high carbohydrate intake on the inflammatory response to exercise that induces muscle damage and inflammation. Methods: The study was a cross-over design. Each subject completed a high carbohydrate condition and a high fat and protein condition. Each condition consisted of 6 sets of 10 maximal high-force eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors and extensors. The exercise was followed by a controlled diet for the first 8 hours post-exercise based on the condition. The cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1&amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2; (IL-&amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2;) were measured as indicators of local inflammation. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured as an indicator of systemic inflammation. Creatine-kinase (CK), muscle soreness, upper arm circumference, and strength loss were measured as indicators of muscle damage. Blood glucose and insulin were measured to identify differences between diets in the conditions. Results: Insulin was significantly increased in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition at 1.5, 4, and 8 hours post-exercise. Perceived soreness was elevated at all time points post-exercise in both conditions and was significantly elevated in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition. There was a main effect trend for IL-6 to be greater in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition. Il-1&amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2; was significantly increased 24 hours post-exercise in the high carbohydrate condition compared to the high fat and protein condition. Conclusion: Elevated carbohydrate intake post-exercise augmented the local inflammatory response to the exercise observed by elevated IL-1&amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2; and IL-6. The augmented inflammatory response contributed to greater perceived muscle soreness post-exercise. Further research is required to investigate this mechanism further to provide better prevention and treatment methods for chronic diseases related to inflammation.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/depner/DepnerC0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of pedometer tilt angle on step counting validity during controlled treadmill walking trials</field><field name="creator">Dock, Melissa</field><field name="description">Pedometers are tools frequently used to monitor walking-related physical activity patterns of overweight and obese populations. However, there is a known association between increasing body mass index (BMI) and decreasing pedometer accuracy. The decrease in pedometer accuracy has been attributed to tilt angle, but the specific tilt angle where pedometers fail to maintain accuracy is unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test two popular pedometer mechanisms, accelerometry- and pendulum-based, to determine the specific tilt angle where the pedometers fail to maintain step counts accurately. METHODS: Twenty subjects (10 men, Mean&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;SD: 25.4&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;4.2 yrs, 184.4&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;5.3 cm, 76.7&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;6.3 kg; 10 women: 21.6&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;3 yrs, 166.1&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;6.3 cm, 56.7&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;6.7 kg) walked two sets of 21 trials at a combination of treadmill speed (67.0, 80.4, 93.8 m/min) and tilt angle (-30,-20,-10, 0,+10,+20,+30&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;) while wearing two pedometers; the experimental pedometer attached to a custom-built pedometer gimbal for altering tilt angle, and the control pedometer in a neutral position (&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;2&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; of 0&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;). The pedometers were worn on each hip just anterior to the iliac crest in line with the mid-axillary line of the thigh. The first set of trials tested one pedometer mechanism, while the second set of trials tested the second pedometer mechanism in a counterbalanced order. Mean steps from the experimental pedometer were compared to the control pedometer for each trial (&amp;Icirc;&#8221;Step=Experimental-Control) using a 3-factor RMANOVA at an alpha level of 0.05. RESULTS: Mean &amp;Icirc;&#8221;steps for the accelerometry-based pedometer and the pendulum-based pedometer differed significantly (P&lt;0.05) at tilt angles &gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;10&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; for treadmill speeds &lt;or equal to 67.0 and 80.4 m/min, respectively. However, mean &amp;Icirc;&#8221;steps across treadmill speeds was much lower for the accelerometry-based pedometer (Mean&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;SE: 4.9&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 2&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 4&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 5&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 4&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 9&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9 steps) than the pendulum-based pedometer (14.1&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 4.2&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 8.9&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 6.8&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 6&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9, 38.1&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;1.9 steps) across conditions &gt; 0&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; (-30, -20, -10, +10, +20, +30&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing tilt angle caused a decrease in pedometer accuracy for both pedometer mechanisms, although the accelerometry-based pedometers were less affected. Negative tilt angles had less effect on pedometer accuracy than positive tilt angles, and the combination of increasing positive tilt angle and slower speeds had the greatest impact on step count accuracy.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/dock/DockM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into student understanding of longitudinal standing waves</field><field name="creator">Dostal, Jack Alan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the difficulties that introductory university physics students have with the concept of longitudinal standing waves in the context of standing waves in pipes.

I first use exploratory surveys and interviews with students to elicit the difficulties present in students\' understanding of longitudinal standing waves in pipes. I then use the information gained to create and assessment instrument, the Standing Waves Diagnostic Test, and a curricular intervention, the Longitudinal Standing Waves Tutorial. I then undertake a three-step process of pre-testing students with the Standing Wave Diagnostic Test, intervention with the Longitudinal Standing Waves Tutorial, and post-testing again with the Standing Wave Diagnostic Test to determine the impact of the intervention. This is then compared to data from students in classes where the intervention is not used. Students using the intervention significantly outperform their non-intervention counterparts on the Standing Wave Diagnostic Test.

As part of this effort quaking aspen response to fire was evaluated in two sub-drainages of the Whitetail Basin three years after treatment. Unburned stands were first surveyed to determine whether regeneration was occurring and to measure the distribution of aspen stems by size class. This information was then compared to stem response in burned stands. Big game and cattle impacts on aspen sucker height and density were measured using a series of 3-part ungulate exclosures in a sub-sample of burned stands. Regeneration was occurring in only1 of 40 unburned stands suggesting aspen was declining in this area. Sucker density increased dramatically in the burned stands after three years increasing the likelihood for regeneration. Within the first three years post-fire big game and the combination of big game and cattle did not affect sucker density in the burned stands. Although sucker height was significantly less in plots used by ungulates we did not feel it was enough to prevent regeneration. This assertion was supported by sufficient annual growth rates and the recruitment of individual regeneration stems into stands outside of protected plots. While it appears fire has increased the potential for aspen regeneration in the Whitetail Basin, early growth rates have allowed for some individual stem to surpass browse height to date, suggesting future monitoring will be necessary to learn if the current recruitment levels are sufficient to regenerate the majority of stands.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/durham/DurhamD1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Now and all are important:  a post-structural critique of humanism, Aldo Leopold's The Land Ethic and Disney/Pixar's Wall-E</field><field name="creator">Dye, Charles Eugene</field><field name="description">Feelings of hopelessness and meaninglessness have become hallmarks of American society.

The Hardness (Ha) locus consisting of the Puroindoline a and b genes (Pina and Pinb) controls the majority of grain hardness variation. Starch production is a growing end-use of wheat. The first objective of this study was to estimate the differences in starch yield due to natural and transgenically conditioned grain hardness differences. To accomplish this goal, a small scale wet milling protocol was used to characterize the wet milling properties of two independent groups of isogenic materials varying in grain hardness and in Pin expression level. The results of the first study demonstrate that the Ha locus and puroindoline expression are both linked to wet-milling starch yield and that selection for increased Ha function increases starch yield via enhanced separation of starch granules and the protein matrix during wet milling. The lack of Pin allelic diversity is a major factor limiting Ha functional analyses and wheat quality improvement. So the second objective of this study was to create new Ha alleles in the soft white spring cultivar Alpowa using ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. The M 2 population was screened to identify new alleles of Pina and Pinb. One hundred and forty eight new Pin alleles, including 68 missense alleles, were identified. F 2 populations for 49 of the new Pin alleles including 43 unique missense ones were developed after crossing each back to non-mutant Alpowa. Grain hardness was then measured on F 2:3 seeds and the impact of each allele on grain hardness was quantified. The tested mutations comprised a range of functionality from neutral to function abolishing mutations. Seed weight and vigor of all mutation lines was restored among all of the F 2 populations. The new alleles have the potential to improve end use properties of soft and hard wheats.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/feiz/FeizL1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the leadership life skills of Montana 4-H youth</field><field name="creator">Flynn, Allison Maurine</field><field name="description">Since its inception, the 4-H program has been through many transitions, and has been constantly challenged to show its benefits to youth. Additionally, funding from 4-H came from multiple supporters resulting in the need for 4-H to show reasons for support. The purpose of this study was to assess the perceptions of Montana 4-H youth related to their leadership life skills and to determine the significant factors that influenced the development of those life skills. The population consisted of 2008 Montana 4-H Congress participants and 2007-2008 Montana 4-H Ambassadors. The survey instrument consisted of three sections: selected demographic information and 4-H participation, involvement in 4-H activities and leadership roles, and the Youth Leadership Life Skills Development Scale (YLLSDS). YLLSDS was a valid and reliable instrument developed by Seevers, Dormody and Clason (1995). Data were collected during the Montana 4-H Congress and survey was mailed to Montana 4-H Ambassadors. The data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SPSS. The responses to the YLLSDS with the highest means were \"have good manners,\" \"get along with others\", and \"show a responsible attitude.\" Analysis revealed that Montana 4-H Ambassadors had statistically significant higher YLLSDS scores than those who had never been an Ambassador. The factors with the greatest influence on leadership life skills development were gender, 4-H Districts, and participation in the Ambassador program. Involvement in 4-H activities predicted 6.9% of the variation in YLLSDS scores and involvement in leadership roles accounted for 7.3% of the variation in YLLSDS scores. Leadership life skills were gained through the Ambassador program, partaking in leadership roles and involvement in leadership activities. The research attested to the effectiveness of the Ambassador program. Further research was recommended to determine which activities, leadership roles and aspects of the Ambassador program were most successful at building life skills. Further research to determine the significant variation between 4-H Districts would be useful. The study supported 4-H as a successful youth organization that responsibly teaches youth leadership life skills.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/flynn/FlynnA1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Riparian vegetation and forest structure of two unregulated tributaries, compared to the regulated Snake River, Grand Teton NP, WY</field><field name="creator">Foy, Elizabeth Christina</field><field name="description">The dynamic nature of rivers shapes riparian plant communities, and changes to the flow regime can have profound effects on these diverse ecosystems. To examine how riparian plant communities of the dam-regulated Snake River in Grand Teton National Park, WY respond to hydro-geomorphological factors, I studied the vegetation of two unregulated tributaries, Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork, in relation to the main river. I considered three perspectives in this analysis. In chapter 2, I examined hydro-geomorphological processes shaping riparian vegetation in naturally flowing systems, by evaluating 15 environmental variables, and determining which were most related to vegetation. Using cluster analysis, I identified six distinct communities. I described environmental conditions associated with each community, using the unconstrained ordination technique NMDS, coupled with generalized additive models (GAMs). Community types occur on characteristic geomorphologic landforms. Depth to gravel, soil texture, pH, distance to bankfull channel, and elevation above water are all related to vegetation, and interact to determine where community types occur. In my third chapter, I compared the vegetation of the unregulated tributaries to the Snake River, as a means of assessing dam effects. Species richness per plot is higher on the tributaries, despite higher overall richness on the Snake River. Through the use of NMDS ordination and clustering techniques, I found the composition of the upper section of the Snake River, immediately below the dam, to be distinct. However, this section is naturally more incised, and the lower sections of the river do not seem to be influenced, suggesting dam impacts on vegetation are minimal. Environmental variables related to vegetation composition include elevation above water, depth to gravel, and geomorphological landform. In chapter 4, I compared age class distributions of spruce and cottonwoods across river sections, and found no evidence for a late-successional trend on the regulated river, versus unregulated tributaries. Age distribution is related to geomorphological landform, and browing also influences forest structure through root coppicing. Forest understory communities are structured by cottonwood age.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/foy/FoyE1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rectangular pellicle beam splitter design</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Jacob Lee</field><field name="description">This project investigates a pellicle beam splitter of rectangular form. A pellicle is a thin optical membrane and a beam splitter separates one optical path into two. The beam splitter under investigation is used at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) for optical component testing and mission simulation in cryogenic vacuum chambers. The conventional beam splitter had undesirable optical performance at cryogenic temperatures. The goal of this project was to use analysis to guide development of pellicle beam splitter prototypes to minimize thermal distortion. Engineers commonly use finite element analysis (FEA) to model structural performance. FEA models were created that represented various prototypes including dimensions, materials, and loads. The models had a rectangular pellicle with a fixed outer boundary. An inner ring of rectangular form was then pressed against the pellicle to create an optical aperture inside the inner ring. Then geometric parameters were varied one at a time to evaluate their effects. The parameters included inner ring corner radii, outer boundary corner radii, inner ring to outer boundary spacing, pellicle thickness, and inner ring displacement. The FEA models indicated that the rectangular form of the pellicle beam splitter contributed to undesirable optical characteristics. Sharp corners of the inner ring create high stress concentration areas causing varying pellicle thickness and undesirable optical quality. Modeling showed that increasing inner ring corner radii and inner ring to outer boundary spacing are affective at increasing optical quality. Other parameters had little to negative affects on optical quality. The rectangular shape of the pellicle beam splitter leads to a non-uniform stress distribution and therefore undesirable optical quality. Stress non-uniformity can be reduced but not eliminated by using large inner ring corner radii and large inner ring to outer boundary spacing. A prototype with large inner ring corner radii was made and tested. The prototype had much better optical performance with little corner affects as compared to previous prototypes.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/fraser/FraserJ0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different encoding strategies affect retrieval of information in collaborative groups</field><field name="creator">Freuen, Margaret Taffy</field><field name="description">This study examined collaborative memory and encoding strategies. Participants read three different stories processed with three different encoding strategies. Each story had two encoding strategies, but participants were only given one strategy per story (Pichert &amp; Anderson, 1977). Later participants recalled and recognized the stories in three test trials. Recall occurred either individually or collaboratively. Pairs of participants read the same stories with the same strategy (congruent condition), the same stories with different strategies (incongruent condition) or the same stories with no strategy (control condition). Participants in incongruent groups did not show an effect of collaboration or collaborative performance equaled nominal performance, whereas congruent collaborative groups showed standard collaborative inhibition effects (Wright &amp; Klummp, 2004). After recall, a two-part recognition test occurred individually. Prior collaboration and strategy influenced importance judgments. Participants formerly in collaborative groups rated items congruent with their strategy as more important and items incongruent with their strategy as less important than did nominal groups. When working in a collaborative group, perhaps attending to different information ameliorates retrieval strategy disruption and aides in the process of collaboration. Additionally, prior collaboration affects importance ratings on a subsequent recognition test.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/freuen/FreuenM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating host response to viral infection through proteomics: a study of murine norovirus</field><field name="creator">Furman, Linnzi M.</field><field name="description">Norovirus causes roughly 23 million cases of foodborne illnesses in the United States each year. While this virus was characterized over 30 years ago, it remains non-cultivatable in human cells, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the host cell's response to infection. However, in 2004 murine norovirus (MNV) was found to be cultivatable in mice and has since been successfully cultured in RAW 264.7 cells. MNV has become an important model system for studying norovirus, as it is structurally and genetically similar to human norovirus. A global proteomics approach using fluorescently tagged, activity-based probes and 2D differential gel electrophoresis analysis was used to study MNV infection. Specifically, the process of cell death was investigated to determine if apoptosis, or programmed cell death, occurred in response to infection. Through the 2D differential gel analysis, 27 differentially regulated proteins were identified at 4 hours post infection, and 22 differentially regulated proteins were identified at 12 hours post infection; a strong majority of these proteins have been related to apoptosis in the literature. Using fluorescently-labeled activity-based probes and fluorimetric assays, we have monitored the activation of several caspases induced by viral infection. Infected samples show a significant increase in caspase activity over control samples within the first few hours post infection, indicating a virally induced activation of caspases. Cells were also infected in the presence of a pan-caspase inhibitor, Boc-D(OMe)-fmk, which led to caspase-independent cell death. Using propidium iodide and Hoechst staining, it was concluded that infected cells undergo necrosis in the presence of the caspase-inhibitor, while those infected in the absence of the inhibitor undergo apoptosis. From these studies it can be concluded that cells infected with MNV undergo a caspase-mediated, apoptotic cell death, while the caspase-independent cell death can be classified as necrosis. This study provides significant insight to norovirus-induced cell death.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/furman/FurmanL0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forest disturbance history in the Sawtooth Mountains of Central Idaho and the Beaverhead Range of Western Montana</field><field name="creator">Gage, Joshua Albert</field><field name="description">Studies of disturbance history are important because they provide a framework for understanding the ecological response to past, present, and future climate change, and this information is useful for paleoecological researchers and land-use managers. Fire and insect outbreaks are common occurrences in western forests, and three studies were undertaken to increase our knowledge of their history in the northern Rocky Mountains. In the first study, sediment cores were sampled from 21 lakes located in forests experiencing mountain pine beetle infestation in the Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho. Cores were analyzed to determine whether or not mountain pine beetle remains were accumulating in the lake sediments in association with recent outbreaks. The study found that insect remains were sparse in the lake sediments, even in sites surrounded by heavily infested forests. These results cast doubt on whether paleo-beetle records can be reconstructed from lake-sediment cores. In the second study, one-meter-long sediment cores were taken from three lakes in Pinus contorta forests in the Sawtooth Mountains, Idaho, to reconstruct a historical record of fire spanning the last 2000 years. High-resolution charcoal analysis of the cores indicated changes in fire activity, but there was not a significant difference in fire occurrence during the relatively dry Medieval Climate Anomaly (1050 - 650 cal yr BP), the cooler Little Ice Age (750 - -50 cal yr BP), and the present day. Results suggest that the current fire regime has persisted for at least 2000 years, with little modification by humans or climate. In the third study, a high-resolution charcoal record was analyzed from Reservoir Lake in the Beaverhead Mountains, Montana to reconstruct the fire history of the last 15,000 years at the lower forest-steppe boundary. The charcoal record indicates relatively low fire frequency between 13,500 cal yr BP and 6000 cal yr BP and increased fire activity from 6000 to 1500 cal yr BP, suggesting increasing aridity in the middle and late Holocene. The fire-climate linkages observed in the paleoecological record provide insights that are useful in understanding future fire regimes with projected climate changes.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/gage/GageJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA binding proteins of archaeal viruses</field><field name="creator">Geary, Joella Suzanne</field><field name="description">Archaea are single-celled organisms comprising the third domain of life.

C43 protein was cloned, expressed, purified, and assayed at various temperatures for interaction with three SSV1 DNA sequences. C43 binds the T5-promoter, T6-promoter, and C43-promoter sequentially and consistently. Additionally, C43 protein is functional at temperatures of 50&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C and 65&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C.

The bacterium causes respiratory and also cutaneous disease predominantly in immunocompromised patients, but infection also occurs in otherwise healthy individuals. M. avium has been frequently isolated from drinking water and it has been shown that the bacterium forms biofilms in drinking water systems. Biofilms show enhanced resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants and therefore are difficult to combat. Biofilm formation is a complex multistep process, and the bacteria change their physiology quite significantly upon entering the attached life style. The process is initiated by a number of triggers that are of both environmental and microbial origin. In this dissertation, biofilm formation was investigated using three different approaches. Firstly, the effect of the universal quorum-sensing signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2) was investigated. The addition of AI-2 to M. avium cultures results in enhanced biofilm formation and transcriptional studies revealed that the bacterium reacts to the compound with upregulation of the oxidative stress response. Oxidative stress was then directly investigated by addition of hydrogen peroxide, also resulting in enhanced biofilm formation. Therefore, it was concluded that oxidative stress leads to M. avium biofilm formation. Furthermore, the importance of the mycobacterial cell wall was studied by comparing biofilm formation of mutants in cell wall-related proteins with the parent strain. These studies revealed a role in biofilm formation that is dependent on the material properties of the surface. Finally, the effect of other bacterial strains and their metabolic by-products on M. avium biofilm formation was studied, as well as the influence of the medium. Although the presence of other bacteria influenced biofilm formation, concentration of the important co-factor iron was shown to be particularly significant in enhancing the process. Collectively, these data suggest that M. avium biofilm formation is enhanced when the bacterium encounters oxidative stress or other bacteria that may represent potential competitors for nutrients or space. It was also shown that the mycobacterial cell wall plays an important part in the attachment process.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/geier/GeierH0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Humor in science and nature films:  just because you can, doesn\'t mean that you should</field><field name="creator">Gerner, Lyn Elaine</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I assert that humor is not generally appropriate for and applicable to science and natural history (\"SNH\") films. Considering perspectives and research on humor from fields spanning comedy writing, documentary film theory, evolutionary psychology, pedagogy, behavioral studies, etc., I\'ll attempt to synthesize some conclusions about treatments, forms and topics that can accommodate humor. I begin by briefly providing some supporting evidence for the assertion that humor has played a minor role in SNH films. I argue that SNH filmmakers have used humor rarely because of specialized aspects of science that naturally result in the routine incompatibility of science with humor. In so doing, I\'ll refer to definitions, classifications, and rules of humor from an experienced comedy writer and scholar. I\'ll relate these principles of comedy to findings of researchers of humor in evolutionary psychology, which are relevant to my subsequent analysis of humor in existing SNH films. I then refer to key pedagogical studies, some of which support humor in the context of learning, but the most relevant of which find negative effects of humor on adult learning. I also briefly examine an adult behavioral study from the field of \"moodmanagement\" that illuminates gender-specific preferences for different kinds of humor. Continuing to draw on the various research fields\' contributions, I analyze examples of some humorous SNH films. I then provide a detailed breakdown of my attempts at humor in my original thesis film treatment, Attack of the Killer Lionfish, and explain why those attempts ultimately failed. Finally, I synthesize some of the conditions under which documentarists might be able to successfully integrate humor, without harming their overall communication goals for the SNH film.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/gerner/GernerL0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distance delivered education at Montana State University - supplementing or supplanting campus registrations:  an exploration of changing patterns over time</field><field name="creator">Godwin, Ian Chandler Paterson</field><field name="description">The problem addressed in this study was that university system and institutional administrators need to know who (geographically and demographically) the consumers of online courses and programs are. The purpose of this comparative study was to identify student populations and registration patterns over an eight year period in on-campus and online courses offered by Montana State University. Whether or not distinct student populations could be identified based on the mode of course delivery (on-campus vs. online) was established through analysis of spatial and demographic data. The design of this project used a comparative approach to identify differences in population demographics and a spatially sensitive correlational approach to identify associations between the spatial nature of on-campus and online registrations over time. The population included all on-campus and online course registrations offered through MSU from academic year 2000-2001 through 2007-2008. A Chi Square test was used to provide a spatially unweighted assessment of \"spatial\" proportionality. The exploratory spatial data analysis tool GeoDa was used to assess the global and local spatial dimension of the research while ANOVAs, factorial ANOVAs, and logistic regression were used to assess the demographic research questions. The Chi Square tests indicated that there are significant differences in the proportion of registrations over time at the local, state and national level. Global spatial autocorrelation tests provide statistically significant, but moderately weak results. The Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) analyses point to considerable overlap in registration \"footprints\" between on-campus and online registrations. Those tests also indicated that changes in spatial patterns have been more evolutionary for online registrations than for on-campus registrations which showed less variation over time. The demographic tests indicated that on-campus and online populations differ both in age and gender composition. The conclusion based on the results is that online courses are likely supplementing, not supplanting campus registrations at MSU. While the geographic analysis points to significant, fairly extensive, and growing geographic overlap between the home-of-origin locations of online and on-campus populations, the age and gender differences clearly indicate that the online population is older and more female than the on-campus population.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/godwin/GodwinI1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance on large-scale science tests:  item attributes that may impact achievement scores</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Janet Victoria</field><field name="description">Significant differences in achievement among ethnic groups persist on the eighth-grade science Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL). The WASL measures academic performance in science using both scenario and stand-alone question types. Previous research suggests that presenting target items connected to an authentic context, like scenario question types, can increase science achievement scores especially in underrepresented groups and thus help to close the achievement gap. The purpose of this study was to identify significant differences in performance between gender and ethnic subgroups by question type on the 2005 eighth-grade science WASL. MANOVA and ANOVA were used to examine relationships between gender and ethnic subgroups as independent variables with achievement scores on scenario and stand-alone question types as dependent variables. MANOVA revealed no significant effects for gender, suggesting that the 2005 eighth-grade science WASL was gender neutral. However, there were significant effects for ethnicity. ANOVA revealed significant effects for ethnicity and ethnicity by gender interaction in both question types. Effect sizes were negligible for the ethnicity by gender interaction. Large effect sizes between ethnicities on scenario question types became moderate to small effect sizes on stand-alone question types. This indicates the score advantage the higher performing subgroups had over the lower performing subgroups was not as large on stand-alone question types compared to scenario question types. A further comparison examined performance on multiple-choice items only within both question types. Similar achievement patterns between ethnicities emerged; however, achievement patterns between genders changed in boys' favor. Scenario question types appeared to register differences between ethnic groups to a greater degree than stand-alone question types. These differences may be attributable to individual differences in cognition, characteristics of test items themselves and/or opportunities to learn.

The use of these VOCs to inhibit or kill a wide range of microorganisms is termed mycofumigation. This dissertation focuses on parameters of MA mycofumigation including: production and bioactivity of previously un-described water-soluble antimicrobial compounds produced by MA; distribution of antimicrobial compounds from a MA point source in three soil types as measured by effects on Verticillium dahliae and Colletotrichum coccodes; control of V. dahliae and C. coccodes on potato; the ability of MA to colonize soil; and the effects of mycofumigation on ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) in vitro and on the colonization of onion roots by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices. The bioactivity of water-soluble compounds produced in potato dextrose broth was significantly increased as measured in growth reduction of C. coccodes, V. dahliae, and Rhizoctonia solani. No reduction was observed for Aphanomyces cochlioides and Pythium ultimum. Antimicrobial compounds from a MA colonized barley point source reduced V. dahliae and C. coccodes populations in soils by 60-100% at distances up to 9 cm from the inoculation source depending on soil type. Mortality rate ranging from 70-100% was observed within a 3 cm radius from the inoculation source. In both field and greenhouse trials, MA colonized barley formulation reduced Verticillium wilt and black dot root rot severity and reduced populations of both pathogens in potato tissue as measured by real-time quantitative PCR and serial dilution. Planting directly into mycofumigated soil previously infested with V. dahliae or C. coccodes resulted in equal control of the pathogens when compared to a one-week mycofumigation period prior to planting. After six weeks of incubation MA did not colonize sterile soil further than 0.5 cm away from a MA inoculation point. In vitro experiments showed that most of the tested EMF were inhibited in the presence of MA VOCs, but were able to resume growth when removed from VOCs. Incorporating MA into soil had no negative but supportive effect on onion root colonization by the AM fungus G. intraradices.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/grimme/GrimmeE1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditional diet of the Saalish, Kootenai, and Pend D\'Oreille Indians in North West Montana and contemporary diet recommendations, a comparison</field><field name="creator">Groessler, Margit Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Native Americans in Montana have a higher prevalence of diabetes that the national average.

Forage cultivars of winter wheat and triticale were subjected to a single grazing event at three growth stages (vegetative, boot, or heading) in the late spring. Subsequent regrowth from each grazing event was harvested as hay. Growth of winter cereals was modeled with environmental conditions. Both cultivars reached 100% headed between accumulated growing degree day (base 5 C&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;) 1090 and 1245 (between July 7 and 13) during the three year trial. During this period, winter cereals experienced rapid forage growth, and grew 1.4 to 2.6 cm daily and produced 87 to 248 kg ha-1 daily. In two years, triticale had superior forage biomass compared to winter wheat. Forage quality of winter cereals was excellent at the vegetative stage of growth and declined until the final forage harvest dates. At all growth stages winter wheat and triticale had similar levels of forage quality. However, the rates of digestibility of winter wheat pasture and hay were greater than those of triticale. When grazed at increasing stages of maturity, winter cereals demonstrated variable forage regrowth yield and quality. Delaying grazing until later dates coincided with hot and dry growing season conditions and limited forage regrowth potential. Regrowth of grazed cereals declined in forage quality with advancing maturity. Nitrate concentrations were high enough to concern producers with pregnant livestock grazing in spring or when grazing regrowth. Grass tetany was found to be a potential risk to lactating livestock grazing early vegetative winter cereal forage. In a whole animal digestion trial, winter wheat hay was had similar digestibility when compared to traditional grass alfalfa hay, in a sheep maintenance diet. Winter cereals can offer producers a viable option for a pasture-hay system in Montana. Maximum total biomass was a single cutting of hay at anthesis and early grain development. Therefore, it will be necessary for livestock producers to consider total biomass, availability and cost of pasture and hay, and forage quality, when using a pasture-hay system in Montana.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/hafla/HaflaA1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural perceptions of American Indian women in Southcentral Montana regarding pre-diabetic education</field><field name="creator">Hartford, Lori Ann</field><field name="description">Treatment of prediabetes includes education which provides the prediabetic person with information to help them make lifestyle modification choices regarding their nutrition, exercise and weight control; in order that they control their illness and delay or prevent the development of diabetes. American Indians have a high incidence of both prediabetes and diabetes as a group compared to other ethnic groups in the U.S. There is a lack of data in the literature about what American Indians from the Crow Tribe in Montana consider to be cultural information that they feel should be included in education for pre-diabetics. This qualitative ethno-nursing study was conducted through one-on-one interviews with six American Indian women of the Crow Tribe over a period of months to determine what they defined as culturally important for the health care provider to know when teaching about prediabetes. The data from these interviews were then analyzed using qualitative software by Ethnograph &amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;, and four primary themes were found. These themes were: extended family and elders, spirituality and traditions, culturally specific foods and activities and a feeling of inevitability of developing diabetes. As cultural competency is an area that is included in all schools of nursing and some schools of medicine, it is important that health care providers have an awareness of cultural specific health information.

I force myself to make editorial choices to reconcile the impartial and detached information provided by the camera with what I already know about the sitter.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/heaston/HeastonP0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient\'s perception of the helpfulness of education materials for breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Heck, Kimberly Keough</field><field name="description">Breast cancer is the most widely diagnosed cancer among women and the second leading cause of death after lung cancer. \"Many women with cancer describe the moment they found out about their diagnosis as truly devastating\" (National Breast Cancer Organization [NBCO], 2000, p.1). There are numerous ways in which women cope during this upsetting time. Two ways to help women cope is to encourage them to understand their new diagnosis through education and exploring all available treatment options. There is a shortage of documentation on breast cancer education and few studies have examined patients\' perception of breast cancer education. The target population for this study was adult women with a diagnosis of breast cancer who received treatment from a medium sized northwestern cancer clinic. The population and the sample consisted of residents from urban and rural regions of central Montana. A convenience sample of persons eighteen years and older consisting of the 168 women who are on the breast cancer survivors\' monthly mailing at the cancer clinic were invited to participate in the study; the actual sample consisted of 59 women. The sample was self-selecting and participation was voluntary. A descriptive, retrospective, cross-sectional design was used as the framework for this study. The questionnaire that was developed for this study was used to collect data that explored participants\' perceptions of the education received. Participants were asked where they received their education about breast cancer and 71.2% said that they received their educational materials from the cancer treatment facility. A large majority (79.7%) indicated that immediately after breast cancer diagnosis they felt ready to learn. Almost half (42.4%) felt acceptance of their breast cancer diagnosis. A total of 63% felt that their educational materials were either very helpful or helpful.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/heck/HeckK0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural analysis of cleavage at Sandy Hollow, McCartney Mountain fold-and-thrust salient, Southwest Montana</field><field name="creator">Helmke, Elizabeth Ashley</field><field name="description">The McCartney Mountain salient is a distinct convex-east segment of the Sevier fold-and-thrust belt in southwest Montana, lying east of the Pioneer batholith and west of basement-cored Laramide uplifts. Prominent features of the central part of the salient include the in-sequence Sandy Hollow thrust fault (displacing Permian over Lower Cretaceous strata), and hanging wall and footwall syncline-anticline pairs that display complex intra-formational duplexes and parasitic detachment folds at all scales. Cleavage occurs in the argillaceous carbonate members of the Cretaceous Kootenai and Triassic Dinwoody formations throughout the area. Cleavage has been systematically mapped and characterized according to morphology, domainal spacing and orientation for all exposed outcrops of a distinctive yellowish dolomitic unit in the lower limestone member of the Kootenai. Cleavage within this unit exhibits planar morphology with domainal spacing at the mm-cm scale, classified as moderate to very strong spaced cleavage. Structural orientation data divides the cleavage into two populations. S1 is defined by cleavage that trends N-S, dips east, and is inferred to be reoriented axial planar cleavage that may have been modified during late-stage shortening as the frontal fold-and-thrust system impinged against basement uplifts in the foreland. S2 is recognized by E-W striking cleavage that dips within 10&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg; of vertical, cross cutting hanging wall, and footwall folds in the area. S2 is inferred to have formed during the final stages of deformation in the Sandy Hollow fold-and-thrust system. S2 may reflect N-S shortening caused by lateral forces along the salient boundary as the fold-and-thrust system propagated eastward into the salient nose.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/helmke/HelmkeE1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sequential cattle and sheep grazing for Spotted Knapweed control</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Stacee Lyn</field><field name="description">Spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe L.) infests millions of hectares of native rangeland in North America. Spotted knapweed creates large monocultures, which decreases biodiversity, reduces livestock and wildlife forage, and increases surface water runoff and soil erosion. Sheep are an effective tool for controlling spotted knapweed and have been widely used on cattle ranches for weed control. However, cattle producers are concerned that sheep will over-utilize desirable graminoids. Therefore, research is needed to determine an effective grazing strategy using cattle and sheep that will adversely affect spotted knapweed, while minimizing over-use of desirable graminoids across the landscape. This 2-year study quantified graminoid and spotted knapweed utilization and diet composition and foraging behavior of cattle and sheep sequentially grazing spotted knapweed-infested rangeland in western Montana. Twenty-one Targhee yearling wethers and 9 Black Angus yearling cattle were used. Animals were randomly assigned to one of 3, 0.81-ha pastures that were grazed in either mid-June or mid-July (n=6 pastures). Cattle grazed each pasture for 7 days, immediately followed by sheep grazing for 7 days in each month. Analysis of covariance was used to determine differences in diets, relative preference indices, foraging behavior, and utilization between June and July for cattle and sheep to determine the optimal month for implementing prescribed sheep grazing. Relative utilization of spotted knapweed did not differ between June and July and averaged 61.5%. Graminoid utilization was moderate (&lt;45%). Cattle preferred forbs in June, spotted knapweed and forbs in July, and avoided graminoids in July. Sheep avoided graminoids in June and July, preferred forbs in June, and showed no preference or avoidance of spotted knapweed. Cattle ranches with large spotted knapweed infestations can effectively use prescribed sheep grazing immediately following cattle grazing in June or July to achieve high levels of use on spotted knapweed, thus reducing viable seeds incorporated into the soil, while maintaining optimal utilization levels on desirable graminoids.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/henderson/HendersonS1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two wavelength Lidar instrument for atmospheric aerosol study</field><field name="creator">Hoffman, David Swick</field><field name="description">A two-color lidar instrument and inversion algorithms have been developed for the study of atmospheric aerosols. The two-color lidar laser transmitter is based on the collinear fundamental 1064 nm and second harmonic 532 nm output of a Nd:YAG laser. Scattered light is collected by the two-color lidar receiver using a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with the 532 nm channel monitored using a gated photomultiplier tube (PMT) and the 1064 nm channel monitored using an avalanche photodiode (APD). Data is collected from the PMT and APD using a 14 bit 200 MHz data acquisition card. The lidar inversion algorithm developed to analyze the data collected by the two-color lidar is based on a constant lidar ratio assumption at both the 1064 nm and 532 nm wavelengths with the constrained ratio aerosol model (CRAM) providing the initial lidar ratios at the two wavelengths to complete the lidar inversion. Data from the CALIOP lidar on board the CALIPSO satellite are presented to verify software algorithm performance. Data from the two-color lidar are then presented demonstrating the two-color lidar instrument\'s capabilities. The analysis of these data identifies smoke and industrial aerosols in the atmosphere above Bozeman. Finally an error analysis of the lidar instrument and accompanying analysis software is presented. The findings of this analysis are that error introduced by the APD and PMT is dominant; the error introduced by the optical detectors is much larger than the error from other sources examined such as quantization error, and the error associated the use of numerical integration in the data analysis algorithm.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/hoffman/HoffmanD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of family leave laws on Cesarean delivery</field><field name="creator">Hogenson, Elise Catherine</field><field name="description">Cesarean rates have increased dramatically since 1965, with nearly a third of all births being delivered by cesarean section in 2006. Although numerous factors have contributed to this increase, this paper estimates the impact of family leave laws on cesarean rates. Leave laws led to increased health insurance coverage, thus altering the financial incentives facing both parents and physicians in the choice of delivery method. The laws also changed leave taking by parents, which may have impacted cesarean rates. The impact of leave laws on cesarean rates is estimated using a difference-in-differences approach coupled with the variation in state leave laws that existed prior to the passage of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) in 1993. The empirical results suggest that state leave laws are associated with an 8 to 13 percentage point reduction in the probability of cesarean delivery, but that the FMLA had little impact on cesarean rates.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/hogenson/HogensonE1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A revision of the West Indian genus Nesocyrtosoma (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)</field><field name="creator">Hopp, Katie Jo</field><field name="description">Nesocyrtosoma Marcuzzi is revised.

The developed system, named GDClust (Graph-Based Document Clustering) [1], works with frequent senses rather than dealing with frequent keywords used in traditional text mining techniques. GDClust presents text documents as hierarchical document-graphs and uses an Apriori paradigm to find the frequent subgraphs, which reflect frequent senses. Discovered frequent subgraphs are then utilized to generate accurate sense-based document clusters. We propose a novel multilevel Gaussian minimum support strategy for candidate subgraph generation. Additionally, we introduce another novel mechanism called Subgraph-Extension mining that reduces the number of candidates and overhead imposed by the traditional Apriori-based candidate generation mechanism. GDClust utilizes an English language thesaurus (WordNet [2]) to construct document-graphs and exploits graph-based data mining techniques for sense discovery and clustering. It is an automated system and requires minimal human interaction for the clustering purpose.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/hossain/HossainM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bout interruptions on measured and predicted physical activity during treadmill walking and running</field><field name="creator">Howe, Stephanie Marie</field><field name="description">The importance of daily physical activity (PA) has been established as a means of decreasing risk for chronic diseases. However, the presence of bout interruptions ((BI), defined as a brief pause (&lt; 2 min) PA), can complicate measures of PA. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of different BI rules on PA during treadmill locomotion. Fifteen runners (6 women, 9 men) completed a series of walking (53.6, 107.2 m/min) and running (160.8 m/min) trials while using a metabolic measurement system to measure actual activity energy expenditure (AEEA) and four activity monitors to measure predicted AEE (AEEP). Treadmill speeds were selected to elicit light (L), moderate (M), and vigorous (V) PA intensities. Both AEEA and AEEP, were calculated as the sum within and between the start and end of each defined trial using 3 BI rules: 1) without an allowance for a BI (BI0), 2) or a 1-min BI allowance (BI1), 3) or a 2-min BI allowance (BI2). TA and TP were defined as the time spent at or above a moderate intensity during each PA bout for BI0, BI1, and BI2. Values of AEEA and AEEP for each BI definition and PA intensity were compared within intensities categories using a 2-factor RMANOVA, while data for all three PA intensities were evaluated simultaneously using a RMANOVA. Similarly, values of TA and TP for each BI definition were compared using the same multivariate RMANOVA model. Mean AEEA and AEEP for BI0 were significantly lower than those for BI1 and for BI2 at all PA intensities (p&lt;0.05). When expressed as a percentage, the increase in AEEA and AEEP between BI0 and BI1, or BI1 and BI2, was 0.3-3.9% and between 5.5-11.0% for TA and TP across all intensities. Allowing for 1- or 2-min BIs within a PA bout significantly influences AEE and time during locomotion. These results suggest that rules for the number of BIs allowed should be established since an increase in BIs will cause PA outcome variables to become more dependent on the BIs than the PA itself.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/howe/HoweS0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postglacial vegetation, fire, and climate history of Blacktail Pond, Northern Yellowstone National Park, WY</field><field name="creator">Huerta, Mariana Angelica</field><field name="description">Previous studies in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) suggest intensification of the summer-dry and summer-wet patterns in Yellowstone during the early Holocene when increased summer insolation caused atmospheric circulation patterns to strengthen. To examine this hypothesis further, pollen and high-resolution charcoal records were analyzed from Blacktail Pond to reconstruct fire and vegetation histories near the present transition between summer-wet and summer-dry conditions. The site currently lies in Pseudotsuga parkland with Artemisia steppe at lower elevations around the pond. The site supported sparse tundra prior to 12,000 cal yr B.P. and fires were uncommon. Between 12,000 and 11,000 cal yr B.P, fire activity increased and Picea-Pinus parkland was established. These changes are consistent with increasing temperature and moisture. Between 11,000 and 7600 cal yr B.P., pollen evidence of a Pinus-Picea-Abies forest is consistent with increased winter moisture, while high fire activity at this time indicates that summers had lower effective moisture than at present. Between 7600 and 4000 cal yr B.P., vegetation around the site shifted to parkland dominated by Pinus, Picea, Pseudotsuga, and Artemisia indicating that effective winter moisture decreased. Fire activity continued to be high during this time suggesting summers maintained low effective moisture. The development of Artemisia steppe around the site over the last 4000 years indicates that effective winter moisture decreased, while decreased fire activity indicates that effective summer moisture increased during this time. Winter conditions during the early Holocene that resemble a summer-wet site along with summer conditions at the same time resembling a summer-dry site could be a result of the geographical setting of Blacktail Pond near the boundary between these two precipitation regimes. Poaceae/Artemisia pollen ratios were used to infer wet/dry climate oscillations during the late Holocene. The fluctuations correspond well with other paleoclimate data from northern Yellowstone National Park (Gennett and Baker, 1986; Hadly, 1996; Meyer et al., 1995), and suggest that conditions were drier from 3775-3125, 2475-2225, 1700- 675, and 425-75 cal yr B.P.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/huerta/HuertaM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon dioxide sequestration monitoring and verification via laser based detection system in the 2 micron band</field><field name="creator">Humphries, Seth David</field><field name="description">Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) is a known contributor to the green house gas effect. Emissions of CO 2 are rising as the global demand for inexpensive energy is placated through the consumption and combustion of fossil fuels. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) may provide a method to prevent CO 2 from being exhausted to the atmosphere. The carbon may be captured after fossil fuel combustion in a power plant and then stored in a long term facility such as a deep geologic feature. The ability to verify the integrity of carbon storage at a location is key to the success of all CCS projects. A laser-based instrument has been built and tested at Montana State University (MSU) to measure CO 2 concentrations above a carbon storage location. The CO 2 Detection by Differential Absorption (CODDA) Instrument uses a temperature-tunable distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode that is capable of accessing a spectral region, 2.0027 to 2.0042 microns, that contains three CO 2 absorption lines and a water vapor absorption line. This instrument laser is aimed over an open-air, two-way path of about 100 m, allowing measurements of CO 2 concentrations to be made directly above a carbon dioxide release test site. The performance of the instrument for carbon sequestration site monitoring is studied using a newly developed CO 2 controlled release facility. The field and CO 2 releases are managed by the Zero Emissions Research Technology (ZERT) group at MSU. Two test injections were carried out through vertical wells simulating seepage up well paths. Three test injections were done as CO 2 escaped up through a slotted horizontal pipe simulating seepage up through geologic fault zones. The results from these 5 separate controlled release experiments over the course of three summers show that the CODDA Instrument is clearly capable of verifying the integrity of full-scale CO 2 storage operations.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/humphries/HumphriesS1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction of EDFA optical power transients using power shaping</field><field name="creator">Jackson, James Trent</field><field name="description">Many erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) based multi-wavelength optical networks employ techniques such as burst-switching or packet switching where the time interval between traffic blocks can be long enough to induce EDFA optical power transients. The optical power transients are created by abrupt changes in the average input power to the EDFAs and can adversely affect the performance of the network. To mitigate the effects of EDFA optical power transients on optical networks, a method called power shaping where heads and tails are joined to the beginning and end of a traffic block is investigated. A head (tail) gradually increases (decreases) the channel power by employing a bit sequence in which the probability of a \"1\" (\"0\") increases from 0 to 0.5. Theoretical and experimental results both show that EDFA optical power transients can be significantly reduced with adequate shaping periods. Experiments also show the bit error rate of the system is reduced for increased shaping periods. Power shaping is an economical means of suppressing EDFA optical power transients compared to other physical layer approaches that require the addition of specialized components and can be applied to EDFAs as well as other solid-state and Raman optical amplifiers.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/jackson/JacksonJ0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of ski pole stiffness on upper body power output in cross-country skiers</field><field name="creator">Jacobson, Erik Andrew</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased pole stiffness corresponds with higher measures of upper body power in competitive cross-country skiers.

I examine the documentary films King Corn and Super Size Me because they incorporate a unique depiction of America's industrialized food system and Americans' relationship to food. I analyze the fiction film Big Night because its depiction of recent Italian immigrants' relationship to food serves to expose the contrasting values that Americans have with regards to food, therefore providing insight into contemporary American food culture. Big Night represents food as a cultural construct, embedding it in a traditional narrative structure in order to portray the conflicting ideologies that surrounded food preparation and eating in post-WWII America. In contrast, the documentary film King Corn incorporates a scientific representation of food by highlighting a series of tests and experiments that expose how the industrialized food system has separated consumers from the land, the soil, and their food. Super Size Me combines these two approaches by depicting food as nature and culture, critiquing our industrialized food system through an investigation of fast food's deleterious effect on public health and an exploration of how it has penetrated our public institutions. By using Big Night as a framework for reading King Corn and Super Size Me, we construct an understanding of contemporary American food culture and American taste preferences. An analysis of these three films suggests that there are serious problems with our industrialized food system and the way in which Americans relate to food. After watching Big Night, King Corn, and Super Size Me, I hope that the public is motivated to make informed choices that will support the creation of a healthier, more sustainable food system in our country's foreseeable future and to reconsider the relationship that we have with our food.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/jelenchik/JelenchikJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines of copper, tears of glass: the birth, growth and death of the Montana Power Company</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Francis Joseph</field><field name="description">Montana Power collapsed amid images of TV reporters for Sixty Minutes chasing flustered Robert Gannon in Butte. The loss of two and a half billion dollars as well as the complete liquidation of thousands of shareholders created this Warhol moment for the firm\'s last president and Montana Power. Other dire consequences followed for the state: loss of Montana\'s only Fortune 500 firm, a doubling of utility bills and the loss of hundreds of jobs for the already depressed Butte area. Montana Power\'s importance transcends this slapstick \"fifteen minutes\" of fame moment at its demise. Montana Power became one of the few utilities to break from state price regulation during the deregulation mania of the 1990\'s. In a jarring development, the firm dissipated all its assets and dissolved shortly thereafter amidst a great deal of controversy. However, besides the failure of the firm after the heated deregulation battle, three other areas of the history of this utility proved pivotal in political, economic and environmental terms for not only the state, but also the rest of the West and the United States, as the events surrounding the Butte firm were often regional or national in scope and importance. First, the creation of the predecessors of the firm occurred at the very dawn of the electrical revolution at the turn of the nineteenth century. Powerful men and institutions from the Eastern United States set up the firm in a colonial-style environment and guided the development of the state. With the electricity revolution, dams, power lines, reservoirs, mills and logging operations appeared throughout the landscape. Second, the Great Depression produced an epic battle between public power advocates and trustbusters versus the Butte firm. The New Deal commenced building the Ft. Peck Dam and power stations, while working diligently to break up the utility trusts that included Montana Power. Third, lengthy car lines at gas pumps in the 1970\'s signaled the onset of the first energy crisis. The power company\'s attempt to generate energy using steam from coal mined in Eastern Montana set off a literal war with newly emergent environmental movement.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/johnson/JohnsonF1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Y ECO: Yellowstone Ecological Center for Observation</field><field name="creator">Kahler, Bradley Scott</field><field name="description">The Yellowstone Ecological Center for Observation (Y Eco) is designed to function as an educational facility that employs sustainable and ecological methods.

Principal component analysis reveals that modern birds with terrestrial lifestyles tend to cluster away from those with raptorial and non-predatory grasping lifestyles although the division is not clean. Most non-avian dinosaurs tend to cluster with terrestrial species although Deinonychus and some Tyrannosaurids cluster with raptorial taxa. Terrestrial taxa tend to have phalanges that are comparatively shorter distally, are relatively wide, and have shallow grooving of the distal trochleae, while grasping taxa show opposing trends. Predatory graspers have proportionately wider phalanges than non-predatory graspers. Discriminant function analysis performs well in distinguishing among species with specialized behavior while taxa with less stereotyped behaviors are harder to classify. Predatory graspers are easily separated from non-predatory graspers. Troodon and Elmisaurus are grouped with terrestrial/cursorial taxa. Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus, Daspletosaurus, and Albertosaurus are identified as terrestrial/cursorial with some possible predatory grasping ability. Deinonychus and Bambiraptor appear to have more grasping ability than Troodon.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/kambic/KambicR0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating quality of traffic flow on two-lane highways</field><field name="creator">Karjala, Sarah Renee</field><field name="description">Since the publication of the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), there have been several studies that indicate that the HCM equations for Percent Time-Spent- Following (PTSF) on two-lane highways do not correspond to field-based measurements.

Both studies were empirical in nature and utilized field data gathered from rural two-lane and four-lane highways in the state of Montana. Six performance measures for two-lane highways were investigated; they were: average travel speed, average travel speed of passenger cars, average travel speed as a percent of free-flow speed, average travel speed of passenger cars as a percent of free-flow speed of passenger cars, percent followers, and follower density. The performance measures were evaluated based on their level of association with major platooning variables. Among all performance measures investigated, follower density and percent followers exhibited the highest correlation to platooning variables, respectively. Overall, follower density was recommended as the best performance measure for two-lane highways. Based on the fact that follower density is a headway-based service measure, the second study aimed to achieve a better understanding of car-following interaction on two-lane rural highways. Car-following interaction was studied by examining headway distributions, speed-headway relationships, and percent followers and flow relationships. The study found that car-following interaction generally ceases when headways exceed a value of approximately six seconds. Also, a significant proportion of drivers choose to maintain relatively short headways while following other vehicles on two-lane highways regardless of passing restrictions.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/karjala/KarjalaS0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary protein versus supplemental protein in collegiate football athletes</field><field name="creator">Kirwan, Rochelle Dian</field><field name="description">Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in athletes can be equally attained through dietary protein intake versus protein supplementation. Methods: Performance measures, body composition, and blood lipids were compared in redshirt football players who completed an eleven week protocol of either protein supplementation (S, n=6, 28 grams 3x/week) versus whole food protein (NS, n=9, 8-28 grams 3x/week). Subjects completed two 3-day diet records to determine nutrient intake. Results: Both groups reported meeting their protein requirements, but caloric intake was below the recommendation. Similar increases (P=0.003) in lean body mass were measured in the S (pre 72.2 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 6.6, post 73.0 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 6.3 kg) and NS groups (69.3 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 8.6, post 70.9 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 8.8 kg). No significant differences were found between the two groups in performance variables. For example, bench press increased (P=0.01) from 251 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 32 to 264 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 36 pounds in the S group and from 245 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 26 to 256 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 28 in the NS group. Conclusion: Both S and NS groups consumed on average at least the recommended protein intake and protein supplementation did not offer any performance or anabolic advantage over whole food protein.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/kirwan/KirwanR0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning from the landfill</field><field name="creator">Kitchens, Jonathan Ashley</field><field name="description">We are a culture of material consumption.

An infant exposed to opiates in-utero causes the neonate to withdraw from the substance after birth. Neonates with NAS are at risk for adverse outcomes including seizures and death along with many adverse symptoms related to neurological excitability and gastrointestinal dysfunction as described by the American Academy of Pediatrics (1998). As mentioned by Hunt et al. (2008), neonates exposed to opiates are at higher risk for prematurity, low birth weight and adverse neurodevelopment. These risk factors are directly related to increased death and adverse outcomes for this population. Variability exists regarding the treatment of NAS. The project intention is to propose an evidence-based practice recommendation for the treatment of neonates with NAS, thus providing consistency in care. A thorough literature search was done using several search engines including Medline, Pubmed, Cochran Library, CINAHL, National Guidelines Clearinghouse, Medline via First Search, and individual journal searches. The evidence was compiled and reviewed for strong research technique including type of randomization, inclusion and exclusion criteria, population representation, bias, confounding variables, and loss to follow-up. Protocol recommendations include evidence based recommendations for the care of NAS including medication treatment protocols. The protocol\'s focus is on increased positive patient outcomes and safety. Specifically, the goal is to avoid adverse outcomes such as seizures and death along with decreased duration of treatment, hospital stay, and nursing care. Overall, the practice recommendations raise multidisciplinary team awareness, increases care consistency, and provides a method for early intervention.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/kusak/KusakK0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An information retrieval system for images from the trace satellite</field><field name="creator">Lamb, Robert Ray</field><field name="description">The ability to identify particular features and structures, such as faces or types of scenery in images, is a topic with many available applications and potential solutions. In this paper we discuss solar images and the results of our preliminary investigation of techniques that can be used to identify solar phenomena in images from the TRACE satellite. Being able to automatically identify various phenomena in solar images is of great interest for scientists studying phenomena on the sun. A set of characteristics that can be quickly extracted from solar images needs to be acquired. These characteristics are used to create classifiers for various phenomena contained in solar images. There are many obstacles that need to be overcome when extracting features and creating these classifiers. These include the inherent unbalanced data sets due to varying rates at which different phenomena appear and multiple phenomenon that could appear in each image. The classifiers that have been generated were used in the creation of an information retrieval system to make finding phenomenon solar images quick and easy.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/lamb/LambR0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated management and causes of damping off disease of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) in Montana</field><field name="creator">Leisso, Rachel Sue</field><field name="description">Chickpea is a minor crop in Montana with great potential for increase in both the conventional and organic sector. The semi-arid climate of much of Montana is well-suited to organic chickpea production, which commands a higher market price than conventional chickpea. Ranking third in the nation for certified organic cropland acres, many operations in Montana are already capable of organic chickpea production. There is a need for rotational crops such as chickpea that are compatible with organic wheat production. In addition to their profit potential, chickpea can perform valuable functions in wheat rotations such as fixing nitrogen and breaking insect pest and disease cycles. Damping-off of chickpea is one of the critical concerns of producers raising organic chickpea. Little was known about the pathogens causing damping off in Montana prior to this research. To determine the organisms responsible for damping off, pathogens were isolated from chickpeas affected by damping off at three field sites and identified to genera. Pythium spp. and Fusarium spp. are the predominate causes of damping off in Montana. Fusarium spp. have not been previously reported in association with damping off of chickpea. To determine if the Fusarium isolates were pathogenic or facultatively pathogenic, eight isolates of Fusarium were indentified to species and pathogenicity tests were performed under controlled conditions. All isolates caused damping off of chickpea. Damping off incidence and severity increased with increasing moisture levels for the majority of the Fusarium isolates. Seed treatments are the most common method of preventing damping off, and biological seed treatments are a control option for organic and conventional growers. The potential for control of chickpea damping off using biological and fungicide seed treatments was tested in greenhouse trials and at three field locations in Montana in 2007. Biological seed treatments Bacillus pumilus GB34 (Yield Shield), B. subtilis GB03 (Kodiak), and Trichoderma harzianum Rifai strain KRL-AG2 (T-22 Planter Box) were compared with conventional seed treatments fluidoxonil (Maxim) and mefenoxam (Apron XL LS) and combinations of biological and fungicide seed treatments in field trials. Treatments containing the chemical fungicide mefenoxam, which targets oomycete pathogens, were most effective for controlling damping off. Biological seed treatments were not effective at controlling damping off.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/leisso/LeissoR0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReDesign: for a new energy paradigm</field><field name="creator">Lewton, Alexander Tripp</field><field name="description">The design community faces immense pressures amidst diminishing energy supplies and anthropogenic climate change. Increasing ecological and sociopolitical instability demand a fundamental change in how we design for the present and future. In an effort to reduce and reverse the cause of this effect, designers are uniquely positioned to bring about much needed change. The impact of this vantage point is directly proportional to a designer\'s understanding of the components that conspire to bring about our current climate and energy crisis. These same components are the crucial players that hold the promise for a reinvention, or re-design, of our present situation. Of particular interest within this discourse are the woven elements of municipal government, social, technical and economic systems as they relate to existing practices of building and infrastructure energy use. Within the U.S., many instances suggest the general public has lost sight of the industrial processes that support our way of life. The average U.S. citizen lacks even a basic understanding of their ecological \'footprint\' and the industrial processes necessary to procure their quality of life. This gap in knowledge has resulted in a \'cultural numbness\' for Americans while permitting these processes to remain disparate and disjointed. Poignant examples exist, however, ripe with intriguing solutions to reverse this trend, ranging from city wide energy conscious strategies to technological building efficiency solutions. The design conclusion of this thesis is a site strategy seeking to synthesize the City of Bozeman\'s solid waste and wastewater treatment processes - with the ultimate intent to sensitize users to its inherent use and function. Within the context of this strategy is a detailed design for a high performing solid waste handling unit. Of the many complexities addressed in this proposal, the primary objectives are to 1) site plan synergies that maximize energy recovery from waste materials, 2) provide electricity and district heat production, 3) create safe, inviting, and high-efficiency spaces for handling solid waste while serving a balance of municipal and public uses, 4) design for modular expansion, demountability, deconstruction and/or reuse, 5) design safe and dignified work environments.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/lewton/LewtonA0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physically aware agile optical networks</field><field name="creator">Lin, Wenhao</field><field name="description">With the development of new laser sources, fiber amplifiers, and other optical components, optical communication systems have undergone enormous growth and evolution in recent decades. The current trend of optical networking is to move towards dynamic, all-optical networks. In all-optical networks, information signals are transmitted from source to destination totally in the optical domain, without the usual optical-electrical-optical conversions at intermediate nodes. New challenges and opportunities emerge in different layers of the optical network architecture in this transition process. This research work explores several interesting topics in both the physical layer and the network layer of all-optical networks. Our studies examine physical impairments which can adversely influence network performance. Both novel proactive and reactive approaches are proposed to improve network performance and provide quality of service (QoS) for users. In the physical layer, network transients, including switch transients and amplifier transients, can pose a serious threat to signal quality in dynamic networks. In all-optical networks, these transients can escalate along a lightpath. In this research, a new functionality is added to the backward reservation protocol to eliminate switch transients and a power shaping technique implemented at the link layer is proposed to decrease in-line amplifier transients. Compared to other approaches in the literature, our designs are more general, economical, and can seamlessly cooperate with other solutions. In the network layer, a new QoS framework is proposed to provide QoS assurance in all-optical networks. The framework has two parts: the Physically Aware Routing algorithm (PAR) and the Physically Aware Backward Reservation protocol (PABR). Analytical models are incorporated into the QoS framework to predict lightpath signal quality with fiber nonlinear effects and ASE noise. For a connection request, the source node executes PAR to select a set of candidate paths which can possibly satisfy the user QoS requirement, and then starts PABR to probe candidate paths in parallel. The destination node selects a satisfactory lightpath from candidate paths. New functionality is designed in PABR to guarantee the signal quality of a lightpath during its life time. The proposed QoS framework is more efficient, scalable, and flexible compared to other benchmark algorithms.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/lin/LinW0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptive Connectivity</field><field name="creator">Lindgren, Amy Jo</field><field name="description">This thesis will investigate how architecture can heighten the experience of obtaining information in a sensual environment.

Sleep disruption is a common problem for hospitalized patients and has been shown to lead to physical and emotional complications. A variety of factors such as pain, illness, stress, worry, noise, lights and patient care activities contribute to disturbed sleep. Studies on sound in hospitals have shown that levels exceed recommendations by the Environmental Protection Agency. Limited research has shown that earplugs are a cost-effective, nonpharmacologic intervention with clinical usefulness to improve sleep quality. The study design was a quasi-experimental pilot study using a pre-test and post-test with the participants serving as their own control. Participants were recruited from a telemetry unit at St. Vincent Healthcare in Billings, Montana. The Verran and Snyder-Halpern Sleep Scales were selected to measure sleep quality. Ten participants were able to complete the two nights of study. The proposed hypothesis was supported for the sleep characteristic, soundness of sleep, with an improvement greater than 15 mm on the night with the ear plugs. Subjective findings identified positive comments with only one participant unable to tolerate the earplugs. The improvement in sleep was clinically significant for these participants. Hospitals should consider creating a sleep promotion policy and re-evaluating their night care practices. Earplugs could be included as an option for patients, and patients experiencing sleep difficulties should be encouraged to try earplugs. Further research is needed with a variety of populations and a large sample size. Research should also be done on nurses\' knowledge and beliefs regarding sleep and sleep interventions. This information could provide useful information on areas where additional education is needed.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/martin/MartinK0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The study of errors, expectations and skills for medication delivery systems improvement</field><field name="creator">Mazur, Lukasz Maciej</field><field name="description">Medication errors occurring in hospitals are a growing national concern. The enormous gaps in knowledge related to medication errors are often seen as major reasons for increased patient safety risks and increased waste in the hospital setting. However, little research effort in industrial and management engineering has been devoted specifically to medication delivery systems to improve or optimize their operations in terms of patient safety and systems efficiency and productivity. As a result, the current literature does not offer integrated solutions to overcome the workflow and management difficulties with medication delivery. Therefore, a better understanding of workflow and management sources of medication errors is needed to help support decisions about investing in strategies to reduce medication errors. Using qualitative and quantitative research methods the work reported in this dissertation makes several contributions to the existing body of knowledge. First, using healthcare professionals' perceptions of medication delivery system, a set of simple and logical workflow design rules are proposed. If properly implemented, the proposed rules are capable of eliminating the unnecessary variations in the process of medication delivery which cause medication errors and waste. Second, a theoretical model of 'expectations' for effective management of medication error reporting, analysis and improvement is provided. The practical implication of this theoretical model extends to effective management strategies that can increase feelings of competence and help create a culture that values improvement efforts. Third, eight propositions for effective use of a systems engineering method (in this research the "Map-to-Improve" (M2I) method) for medication delivery improvement are offered. Finally, a set of skills needed for future healthcare professionals to effectively use systems engineering methods is provided. The proposed insights into these areas can result in improved pedagogy for professional development of healthcare professionals. The practical implication extends to the development of better methods for healthcare systems analysis. In summary, the author of this research work hopes that the findings and discussions will help healthcare organizations to achieve satisfactory improvement in medication delivery.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/mazur/MazurL0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional growth through mentoring:  a study of experienced mathematics teachers participating in a content-based online mentoring and induction program</field><field name="creator">McAleer, Salme DeAnna</field><field name="description">It is well established that early career teacher practice can benefit from participating in effective mentoring and induction programs and experienced teacher practice can be enhanced by participation in successful professional development. But can experienced teachers improve their practice through their role as a mentor in a mentoring program? Although anecdotal evidence suggests that mentor teachers grow professionally through mentoring, there is limited research supporting this claim. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the professional growth of mentor mathematics teachers participating in an online content-based mentoring and induction program, e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS). In specific, this mixed-methods study sought to determine what aspects of eMSS contributed to mentor professional growth and over what domains this growth occurred. Because the mentoring program was online, teaching and learning were dialogue driven and text-based. Therefore, this study also sought evidence of the mentor teachers\' professional growth in the online dialogue and commentary they provided for analysis. Finally, active engagement in professional development is hypothesized to be a precursor to professional growth and development. Using mentors\' activity level as a measure of engagement, this study also sought to determine if activity level was related to mentors\' perceived professional growth. The results of this study indicate that mentor mathematics teachers did grow professionally as a result of participating in eMSS. The experienced teachers reported growth in all assessed domains, particularity in their reflective practices, professional engagement and leadership, pedagogical knowledge, and in their access to instructional resources. Two predominant avenues of professional growth were cited as being important including reflection on practice and communicating with other mathematics educators. Program flexibility was also named as an important facilitator of professional growth. Finally, it seems that a mentor\'s activity level does positively relate to perceived professional growth and that much growth occurs \"behind the scenes\" and may not be evident in participants\' posts. In conclusion, implications of the findings and how the findings may be used to purposefully design mentoring programs to assist in the professional development of mentor mathematics teachers are offered to program designers. Recommendations for further research are also suggested.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/mcaleer/McAleerS0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of porous ceramics with graded columnar pore sturctures via freeze-tape casting</field><field name="creator">McCrummen, John Drew</field><field name="description">Freeze-tape casting is a new processing technology that can generate continuous columnar-graded pore structures utilizing a wide variety of ceramic and/or metallic powders. The uni-directional solidification and subsequent freeze drying of yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) based aqueous cast tapes is being evaluated for various applications including fuel cells, filtration/separation membranes, and catalyst supports. The degree of pore divergence, pore packing, and pore orientation can be actively tailored by altering the solids loading, freezing rate, and tape pulling speed. The effects of solids loading and freezing rate is discussed with respect to morphology of ice growth. SEM and density data is reported to establish the breadth of tailorability and extent of anisotropy in the frozen tapes. The freeze cast structure of ceramic materials is highly porous. The production of freeze cast, YSZ-based tapes include tap casting techniques and high temperature sintering steps. SEM analysis is displayed at varying angles relative to casting direction to provide further insight of the morphology of these materials. Results of varying solids loading and freezing temperature studies are discussed in detail. Compressive strength data by ASTM standard methods was resultant of concentric ring-on-ring testing and is further explained.

The parasitic inductance and capacitance of traditional package interconnect such as wire bonds, create noise sources which ultimately limit the speed at which a digital system can run. Recent advances in package interconnect have reduced these parasitics by moving to a System-in-Package (SiP) approach. In SiP, multiple IC dies are connect directly to each other and encapsulated within the same package. This improves performance by eliminating the need for board-level interconnect. While SiP has made significant progress in reducing the interconnect parasitics, IC dies are still connected using traditional methods such as wire bonds. The unshielded nature of the wire bond leads to noise sources such as coupling, simultaneous switching noise, and reflections. This thesis presents a new interconnect methodology which aims at improving the signaling speeds between dies within SiP. This new system uses a miniature coaxial cable that connects to on-chip coplanar waveguides on a silicon substrate. The coaxial-to-coplanar transition is accomplished using an anisotropic etch along the perimeter of the silicon substrate. This approach provides the electrical and mechanical mating of the on and off chip conductors. This system yields a fully shielded, matched impedance signal path in addition to a low impedance return path. This approach shows reduction of the three main sources of electrical noise in SiP and leads to a significant improvement in system performance.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/mcintosh/McIntoshC1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction between tectonics, topography, and climate in the San Juan Mountains, Southwestern Colorado</field><field name="creator">McKeon, Ryan Edward</field><field name="description">Alpine glaciers have been referred to as "buzzsaws" on the grounds that they control the topographic development of actively deforming mountain ranges; however, the nature of the linkage between glacial erosion and topography in different tectonic and climatic settings remains unclear. In the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, an intracontinental mountain range with dramatically lower annual precipitation than previously studied ranges, distinct spatial variations in morphology resulting from Quaternary glaciation coincide with different exhumation histories that were derived using apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology. The northwestern region had cooling ages of 3-10 Ma over an elevation range of 1300 m, moderate correlation between mean elevation and glacial thresholds, and regionally high values for relief and slope above cirque floors. The southern region, by contrast, had cooling ages of 19-32 Ma over an elevation range of 800 m, no correlation between mean elevation and glacial thresholds, and low values for relief and slope above cirque floors. The average magnitude of incision into a reconstructed maximum topography surface is nearly equal for the two study regions suggesting that the effects of glacial erosion are localized to high topography. The northwestern and southern regions show little variation in climate and fluvial and hillslope erosive potential, which implies that erosionally induced isostatic rebound is an unlikely source for the difference in cooling ages. Instead, I infer that active tectonism (possibly related to the Aspen anomaly) is responsible for different cooling ages and drove the greater degree of glacial modification of the northwestern region. As a result of the spatial variability in epeirogenic uplift, the San Juan Mountains appear to be both a mountain range that was just high enough to be glaciated, the southern region, and a mountain range where glacial erosion controls the elevation of high topography, the northwestern region; and thus are a microcosm for the diverse mountain ranges of the western United States.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/mckeon/McKeonR1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An estimation of the demand for gasoline in Montana, and projections of future gasoline consumption</field><field name="creator">McNay, Aaron David</field><field name="description">How gasoline consumption responds to changes in its own price is of interest to many different groups. States fund a large portion of their road construction and maintenance by a direct tax on gasoline. The federal government also receives revenue by directly taxing gasoline. Automobile manufacturers are interested in how consumers\' demand for fuel efficiency changes with changes in the price of gasoline. For these reasons, and more, it is important to understand how gasoline consumption will respond to changes in price. Other researchers have already attempted to measure gasoline demand at the national level. However, very little work has been done at a state level. This thesis attempts to apply a model similar to the previously developed national models at a state level. The state examined here is Montana. This state is of particular interest because it differs from the national average in several key characteristics, including more vehicles per capita, less fuel efficient vehicles, and few alternatives to driving such as public transportation. The model employed simultaneously estimates the demands for vehicle miles traveled and fuel efficiency. By estimating the demands for both of these variables, it is possible to indirectly determine the demand for gasoline. When estimated, it appears that Montana\'s consumption of gasoline is less responsive to changes in gasoline prices, and more responsive to income changes, than the nation as a whole. The estimated model is used to project future gasoline consumption. The projections were developed using potential future levels of income, population, and gasoline prices. These projections indicate that it would require gasoline prices rising considerably before per capita consumption would decline.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/mcnay/McNayA0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reclamation potential of experimental oak mat and conventional natural gas drill pad construction techniques in a sagebrush steppe community</field><field name="creator">McWilliams, Colin Shamus</field><field name="description">Conventional cut-and-fill drill pad construction associated with natural gas production displaces existing plant communities and results in surface disturbances requiring extensive soil remediation and revegetation. At the Jonah natural gas field, Wyoming, use of an oak mat drilling platform placed atop the intact landscape was evaluated to facilitate drilling while minimizing disturbances to soil and plant resources. Concerns inherent to both techniques include adverse, long-term impacts to vegetation communities, soil compaction and soil physical and chemical characteristics. The percent change (%&amp;Icirc;&#8221;) in grass density at oak mat removal areas (OMRA) (+37 %) was significantly greater than at cut-and-fill locations reclaimed pre-2005 (RCAF&lt;05) (+16 %).

It is counterintuitive to expect that oak mats should alter physicochemical soil properties. Although limited to construction on slopes &lt;or equal to 3 %, measured vegetation and soil characteristics indicated that the reclamation success of oak mat drill pads was greater than that obtained at reclaimed cut-and-fill locations.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/mcwilliams/McWilliamsC0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of lacustrine-adfluvial bull trout populations in an interconnected system of natural lakes</field><field name="creator">Meeuwig, Michael Hendrik</field><field name="description">Loss of connectivity among populations and interactions with nonnative species can negatively influence abundance of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus. Connectivity among bull trout populations and trophic relationships among native and nonnative fishes in Glacier National Park (GNP), Montana, were examined. Competition between juvenile (&lt; or equal to 80 mm) bull trout and lake trout S. namaycush for cover habitat was examined in a laboratory environment. Connectivity among bull trout populations was inferred from genetic data. Barriers (i.e., waterfalls &gt; or equal to 1.8 m) reduced genetic diversity and increased genetic differentiation among populations. Genetic differentiation was positively related to the length of tributary stream sections between populations and populations within the same drainage were more similar than populations in different drainages. Competition between bull trout and nonnative lake trout for prey is a potential mechanism for declines in bull trout abundance. Stable isotopes analyses were used to examine trophic relationships among fishes in GNP lakes. Bull trout and lake trout were top-level predators among lakes (Delta15N analysis), lake trout occupied a higher trophic position than bull trout (Delta15N analysis), and bull trout and lake trout likely used different foraging habitats (Delta13C analysis). These data do not support the prediction that these species are complete competitors for prey resources in GNP. Cover habitat protects fish from predators and is competed for if limiting. Habitat use by juvenile bull trout and lake trout was experimentally evaluated. Bull trout and lake trout differed in habitat use. Lake trout avoided bottom habitat, bull trout avoided water column habitat when lake trout were present, and neither species selected cover habitat. The hypothesis that bull trout and lake trout compete for cover habitat was not supported. The landscape in GNP allows connectivity among bull trout populations that are not isolated by barriers and one-way dispersal past waterfalls is likely. This connectivity allows dispersal and colonization by nonnative fishes into GNP lakes. Bull trout and nonnative lake trout are not complete competitors for prey resources in GNP or cover habitat; however, future studies should examine trophic shifts by these species associated with prey limitation and diel variability in habitat use by these species.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/meeuwig/MeeuwigM1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil and plant response to slash pile burning in a ponderosa pine forest</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Natalie Jo</field><field name="description">Slash pile burning is the most common method of forest residue disposal following ponderosa pine restoration harvests, which are intended to reduce the risk of catastrophic fire and restore the historical structure and function of forests in western Montana. The impact of high-intensity, long-duration fire (pile burning) on soil processes and plant community dynamics is not well understood. The objectives of this study were: (1) to characterize the influence of slash pile burning on soil nutrient availability, soil microbial activity, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) infection; (2) to compare seeding and soil amendment effects on burn scars. In May 2006, slash piles were burned in a ponderosa pine stand near Florence, Montana and 45 scars were sampled. Soil samples were collected from three locations in each slash pile to a depth of 10 cm and characterized for available soil NH4 +-N, NO3 - -N, potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), and total C and N, water-soluble PO4 3- -P, microbial biomass, and mycorrhizal inoculum potential (MIP). In the burned center, soil NH4 +-N was greatest one month post-burn and remained elevated one year later. There was no observable increase in NO3 - -N until one year post-burn. Soluble PO4 3- -P was not impacted by burning. Microbial biomass was reduced by burning and did not recover one year later. Pile burning greatly reduced MIP. In October 2006, fire scars were either seeded with native graminoids or left non-seeded, divided into subplots, and assigned to one of five treatments: control, addition of local organic matter, scarification, scarification and organic matter addition, or scarification and commercial compost addition. Soils were monitored for the previously measured soil parameters and resin-sorbed inorganic N. Scarification with organic matter amendment and scarification with compost amendment both ameliorated soil properties. Seeding most effectively increased plant cover and suppressed non-native invasive species, while scarification or scarification with organic matter amendment further improved early plant establishment. Collectively, these data help characterize the impacts of slash pile burning as a management technique in ponderosa pine forests and illustrate potential treatments for restoring burn pile scars.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/meyer/MeyerN1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The private lives of scientists:  revealing the human-side of science film</field><field name="creator">Misztal, Stefanie Snioszek</field><field name="description">As a genre, science films have routinely dehumanized the scientists who appear in them, portraying these characters as simple, one-dimensional encyclopedias of knowledge, whose sole purpose is to relay facts and provide expert testimony in support of the filmmaker\'s agenda. These films fall short of their true potential when they neglect to present their subjects as complex, multidimensional human beings with fascinating stories, opinions, tragedies and comedies to share about their lives. As science filmmakers we should attempt to re-humanize the way science is portrayed on film by looking to examples like standpoint feminist theory, which advocates owning our particular, incomplete subjective-viewpoints, or \'standpoints\' as a form of empowerment. Championed by scientist and feminist scholar Donna Haraway, these partial perspectives allow filmmakers to create a place where the public and private lives of scientists can not only co-exist, but also strengthen one another. By exploring the complex world in the private lives of scientists, we can give greater respect to scientists themselves as well as to the intelligence and emotional needs of the greater public. To treat science and the people involved in its construction with more ethical responsibility, to build a more empowered and enlightened public, we as filmmakers need to introduce the personal values of willing scientists into the public sphere. If we can reinvent the science film as an endeavor steeped in humanity, it may become a more ethical and effective communication tool to fill these growing needs.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/misztal/MisztalS0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioral, ecological, and fitness consequences of hybridization between native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewis) and nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss)</field><field name="creator">Muhlfeld, Clint Cain</field><field name="description">Anthropogenic hybridization is one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity. Hybridization and introgression may lead to a loss of locally adapted gene complexes and ecological adaptations in native populations, yet these potential consequences have not been fully evaluated in nature. I investigated factors influencing the spread of hybridization between native westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) and nonnative rainbow trout (O. mykiss) in the upper Flathead River system, Montana (USA) and British Columbia (Canada). The fundamental questions of my dissertation were: what are the behavioral, ecological, and fitness consequences of hybridization and what factors influence successful invasion of hybrids? First, I assessed the patterns of spawning between parental species and their hybrids and found that hybridization alters the spawning behavior of migratory westslope cutthroat trout, and is spreading via long distance dispersal of hybrids from downstream sources and some temporal overlap during spawning. Second, I describe for the first time how a wide range of levels of nonnative admixture affect fitness of cutthroat trout in the wild by estimating reproductive success in a recently invaded stream using parentage analysis with multilocus microsatellite markers. Small amounts of hybridization markedly reduced reproductive success, with fitness exponentially declining by ~50% with 20% nonnative genetic admixture. Finally, I evaluated the association of local-habitat features, landscape characteristics, and biotic factors with the spread of hybridization in the system, and found that hybridization increases in streams with warmer water temperatures, high land use disturbance and close proximity to the source of hybridization; however, none of these factors appeared sufficient to prevent further spread. These combined results suggest that hybrids are not only genetically different than westslope cutthroat trout but also have reduced fitness and are ecologically different, and that hybridization is likely to continue to spread if hybrid populations with high amounts of rainbow trout admixture are not reduced or eliminated. I conclude that extant aboriginal cutthroat trout are at greater conservation risk due to hybridization than previously thought and policies that protect hybridized populations need reconsideration.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/muhlfeld/MuhlfeldC1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myxobolus cerebralis in native Cutthroat trout of three spawning tributaries to Yellowstone Lake:  a qualitative ecological risk assessment</field><field name="creator">Murcia, Silvia</field><field name="description">Most environments impose periodic or stochastic stress on natural populations, which increase susceptibility to diseases. Infection by Myxobolus cerebralis (exotic parasite causing salmonid whirling disease) is strongly influenced by a stream\'s physicochemical attributes and stressors, which may also affect host pathology. Susceptibility to M. cerebralis varies greatly among different species and subspecies of the salmonid host, but little is known about lesion severity or location of infection among the native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri). In 2002 and 2003 we performed a series of 10-day sentinel cutthroat fry exposures and habitat assessments in various sites of three M. cerebralis-positive tributaries to Yellowstone Lake: the Yellowstone River, Pelican Creek, and Clear Creek. At 90 and 150 days post-exposure, fry were examined by polymerase chain reaction and histology to determine prevalence, severity, and location of infection. The goal was to identify spatiotemporal patterns of infection, and physicochemical features of the streams influencing it, and potentially facilitating parasite invasion and establishment. Results on fish (young and adult) host infection data, environmental attributes, and tubificid host presence/absence data in the study streams were used to develop an ecological risk assessment for parasite establishment and whirling disease in this ecosystem. Results from our qualitative risk ranking systems suggest that the cutthroat trout of the Yellowstone Lake basin are highly susceptible to M. cerebralis infection, with the most severe lesions in cartilage of the cranium and jaws, especially in systems with high water temperatures and ionic content. Our results also suggest that such environmental features are most conducive to parasite establishment, especially in tributaries of the lake basin used by cutthroat trout as spawning and rearing habitats. Thus, this study has implications for both ecology and parasitology as it reveals that environmental components can affect when and where a pathogen resides within the host, and thereby affect manifestation of disease. Recognition of the specific environmental attributes most conducive to parasite establishment, and disease, can increase future diagnostics, detection, and management efforts, strengthening the likelihood of correctly predicting M. cerebralis\' and similar pathogenic invasions and establishment in unsampled sites.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/murcia/MurciaS0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anti-Stokes generation in a continuous wave raman laser</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Sytil Kathleen</field><field name="description">The continuous-wave Raman laser system differs from other Raman systems in that it uses cavity enhancement to augment the pump laser source rather than a high-power pulsed laser source. Through interactions of the pump laser with the Raman active medium, all Raman systems can produce both red-shifted, Stokes, emission and blue-shifted, anti-Stokes, emission. Previous, continuous-wave Raman laser systems have focused on the Stokes emission. This dissertation presents theory and data on the anti-Stokes emission. Specifically, it investigates the anti-Stokes mode structure and the emitted power as a function of input pump power, detuning, pressure, and mode combination. In order to be able to compare theory to data, the existing semi-classical CW Raman laser theory is extended to include the possibility that the spatial mode of any of the three fields (pump, Stokes, or anti-Stokes) is not the fundamental spatial mode. Numerical simulations of this theory are used to understand the behavior of the CW Raman system. All the data is compared to the theory, with varying degrees of success. The pump laser used in this research is a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG at 532 nm and the Raman active medium is H 2. This combination results in Stokes and anti- Stokes wavelengths of 683 nm and 435 nm, respectively. Five methods were found in this research for increasing the amount of anti-Stokes emitted: increasing the input pump power, detuning from gain line-center of the Stokes emission, increasing the reflectivity of the cavity mirrors at the anti-Stokes wavelength, switching to a higher-order spatial mode, and decreasing the H 2 pressure within the Raman cavity. In general, it was found that the higher-order anti-Stokes modes did not agree with a single theoretical spatial mode. Superpositions were formed of multiple theoretical spatial modes giving intensity distribution across the profile similar to the measured profile. Three theoretical spatial mode symmetries were investigated: rectangular, cylindrical, and elliptical. Also measured was the Raman gain as a function of pressure. The accepted theory for the Raman linewidth was found to be slightly off.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/murphy/MurphyS0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Well water contaminants and consumer-based treatment systems: a resource for primary care providers</field><field name="creator">Nagoda, Daniel Louis</field><field name="description">An estimated 95% of rural residents use groundwater as their household water supply for drinking and everyday use. Public policy in Montana and through most of the United States dictates no rules about well water testing, only recommends testing be done on a yearly basis.

The choice of a consumer-based water filtration system should be based on the contaminant profile of the water source. Filter types vary in design and their contaminant removal profile, such as simple pitcher filters, activated carbon, and reverse osmosis, but many filtration systems can remove multiple contaminants and reduce the risk of exposures. The purpose of this project is to provide a list of potential contaminants and their health effects that have commonly been identified as contaminants in water samples in Gallatin County, Montana, as well as provide a comprehensive resource for consumers and health care providers to make decisions about well-water treatment.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/nagoda/NagodaD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray characterization of buried layers and interfaces in EuO based spin-filter tunnel junctions</field><field name="creator">Negusse, Ezana</field><field name="description">Spin filtering tunnel junctions provide a convenient method for controlling and manipulating the spin of electrons in spintronic devices. In a tunnel junction, the tunneling current depends exponentially on the thickness of the tunneling barrier. Ultrathin (~20 angstroms) barriers are highly desirable because they lower the junction resistance. In addition to the barrier thickness, the spin filtering efficiency of the junction depends on the tunneling barrier\'s magnetic properties and the nature of the barrier-electrode interfaces. EuO\'s high TC (69 K) and large exchange splitting (2 &amp;Icirc;&#8221;E = 0.54 eV) in the conduction band make it a material of choice for achieving a spin-polarized tunneling current. We examined the properties of ultrathin EuO films of different thicknesses with different electrodes. The chemical and magnetic characterization of buried layers and buried interfaces was done using interface sensitive x-ray techniques with element specificity and magnetic contrast. Of the many materials studied, we found that yttrium overlayers are the best electrodes to protect the EuO barrier and prevent formation of Eu2O3, a stable nonmagnetic oxide, at the top (EuO-electrode) interface. We examined the electrode-EuO interfaces of EuO films with Cu bottom electrode deposited on Cr/Cu buffer layer. We found that the roughness of the top and bottom interfaces (above and below the EuO layer) is random and nonconformal in nature. EuO films grown on Cr/Cu buffer layer have smoother top interfaces compared to those deposited directly on Si substrate or Al bottom electrode. Moreover, compared to the Cr/Cu or Cu/EuO interfaces, the top (EuO-electrode) interface is smoother. Here we present results from chemical and magnetic characterization of ultrathin EuO film and the impact of reduced barrier thickness on the magnetic properties of the ferromagnetic tunneling barrier.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/negusse/NegusseE0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disease control and plant defense pathways induced by Bacillus mojavensis isolate 203-7 and Bacillus mycoides isolate BMJ</field><field name="creator">Neher, Oliver Thomas</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the plant defense pathways induced by Bacillus mojavensis isolate 203-7 (203-7) and B. mycoides isolate BmJ (BmJ) and to test their ability to control fungal pathogens on tomato and cucumber by means of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). An Arabidopsis thaliana mutant - Botrytis cinerea pathosystem was used to investigate plant defense pathways activated by 203-7 and BmJ. A. thaliana wild type (Col-0), ein2-1, jar1-1, NahG, ndr1-1/npr1-2, and npr1-1 mutants were induced by application of bacilli, distilled water, or chemical inducers. Both bacilli reduced disease severity on wild type and NahG mutants, but provided no reduction on jar1-1, indicating that induction was salicylic acid (SA) independent but jasmonic acid (JA) dependent. 203-7 induced plants had lower disease severity on npr1-1 and ein1-2 mutants but were equivalent to buffer controls on jar1-1 mutants. BmJ did not decrease disease severity on npr1-1, jar1 or ein2-1 mutants. Enzyme assays confirmed the induction of chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, and superoxide dismutase by 203-7 and BmJ. These results demonstrate that induction by 203-7 is JA dependent and NPR1 independent. BmJ is SA independent but NPR1 and JA/ethylene dependent. Bacilli were tested for their ability to control B. cinerea grey mold on hydroponically grown greenhouse tomatoes and Glomerella cingulata var. orbiculare on cucumber by means of SAR. Weekly foliar applications of bacilli were able to significantly (a=0.05) reduce the severity of grey mold leaf lesions and to reduce the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) calculated for seven Botrytis stem canker ratings. Chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanase, and SOD activity of apoplastic fluids were not significantly (a=0.05) increased by the treatments. Bacilli reduced total and live spore production of G. orbiculare per mm 2 of lesion and increased beta-1,3-glucanase activity of cucumber apoplastic fluids. Applications of BmJ compared to fungicides for the control of anthracnose in cucumber (var. 'General Lee') and cantaloupe (var. 'Athena') were evaluated in 2004 and 2005 field experiments. BmJ applied seven days before inoculation provided disease reduction in cucumber and cantaloupe statistically equal to the fungicide treatments.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/neher/NeherO1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The healing nature of dwelling</field><field name="creator">Newman, Andrea Ardele</field><field name="description">My thesis will discuss the historical pattern of mistreatment and misunderstanding of the chronically mentally ill and the continued struggle the population faces.

Traditionally, mountain localities of the western United States have been centers of natural resource extraction and production. Many of these settings however, are being redefined as part of an amenity-oriented, economy and lifestyle. Whereas Old West landscapes reflect industries of mining, farming, ranching, and logging, the New West has become a spatial arena for recreation, tourism, and second-home development. Consequently, different land use ethos and land management practices between residents have led to conflict over resources. This study reconstructs settlement patterns and land use histories for southwest Montana\'s Crazy Mountains between 1900 and 2000 to illustrate some of the ways in which the dichotomous interplay of Old and New West economies has quietly reshaped the region\'s human geography and cultural landscape. In addition, interview data with local residents allowed an examination of the complex mosaic of changing cultural values that accompany the transformation between the Old and New West.

In biology this is known as morphology-the study of structure or form. The morphology of an organism is a product of environmental conditions and its interaction with that environment. The morphology of space, then, is the study of the relationship between the measurable forces acting on a space and its shape. It is an exploration of the poetic and pragmatic link between environment and design-a search for how a building can be cast by its shadow. The research, observations and images contained in these pages form the foundation for the design of a Wind Technology Center for Montana. Inspired in part by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Wind Technology Center near Boulder, Colorado, this facility will provide research services to private companies involved in Montana's current wind energy boom. Additionally, it will conduct grant-funded research into alternative uses of energy generated by wind-an especially relevant topic in Montana, considering our significant wind resources and our limited transmission infrastructure. The site for this project is in the Yellowstone River Valley northeast of Livingston, Montana, one of the windiest places in the state and possibly the nation. The project's program and design will express the forces present on the site (considered to include both the immediate site and Montana as a whole) through the development of system of analysis inspired by studies of morphology and facilitated by digital design techniques. Importantly, the building will also be an icon for wind energy in Montana and a flagship building for sustainability as our culture transitions to a more carbon neutral fuel economy. Located on a highly visible site along Interstate 90, it is positioned to become an architectural icon as well, a facility for exporting both technology and awareness.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/ostlind/OstlindJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I\'m so bored with the U.S. - and beyond:  theorizing the emergence of postmodern slackers and global Generation X culture</field><field name="creator">Paliobagis, Ariana Jade</field><field name="description">The generation which came of age in the late 1970s through the 1980s has often been described as a cohort of slackers, lazy layabouts who shamelessly rejected the previous generation\'s passionate attempts at revolution. I argue instead, however, that Generation X, as Canadian writer Douglas Coupland termed it, is responsible for a revolution of its own, but its lack of resemblance to any previous social upheavals has caused it to be misunderstood by many. The failure of the youthful rebellions of the sixties and the shallow response to this of the eighties - selfish materialism - prompted this new generation to abandon both group movements and self-advancement; rather, many members of Generation X found that rejection of received ideas and identities - particularly those based in and created through traditional appreciations of and relations to time and place - allowed them to create identities and modes of living which are meaningful and viable in a global postmodern world, attitudes that take advantage of the fragmentation of identity experienced in the postmodern era rather than fighting the general lack of connection brought about by the cultural and economic realities of the period. Through passivity, inaction, acceptance of mediocrity and boredom, the preference for the individual over the community, and their ability to deftly negotiate the rapid increase in world consumer capitalist economies and global information and communication technologies, postmodern slackers have disassociated themselves from systems of any sort: religious, economic, political, familial, or cultural. As a result, these young men abandon the accepted de rigueur \"accomplishments\" of adulthood such as marriage, family, home, and career, instead opting to create identities, homes, families and careers out of a hodgepodge of cultural detritus, including both high and popular culture. They accept this fragmentation of identity as a matter of course rather than allow it to produce significant anxiety, as in previous generations, and as a result, are acutely prepared to thrive in the global postmodern era even as they redefine the meaning of success.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/paliobagis/PaliobagisA0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of test bed software for a smart antenna system supporting wireless communication in rural areas</field><field name="creator">Panique, Michael David</field><field name="description">This paper explores the design and development of a test bed to analyze feasibility of utilizing adaptive smart antennas in conjunction with high bandwidth WiMAX radio systems to achieve improved performance for mobile nodes and to suppress potential interference from unwanted signals. Although the new WiMAX standard offers the potential for using smart, adaptive antennas, this functionality has not been implemented. This design serves as a common platform for testing adaptive array algorithms including direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, beamforming, and adaptive tracking, as well as complete wireless communication with a WiMAX radio. Heavy emphasis will be placed on ease of implementation in a multi-channel / multi-user environment. Detailed here, is the design and development of an 8-channel adaptive smart antenna test bed for WiMAX radio systems. The test bed consists of an 8-element circular antenna array, a PC running a software interface, and RF receiver and transmission boards which enable DOA estimation and beamforming to take place. We have developed a LabVIEW interface for a PC controlled smart antenna test bed supporting two mobile targets. The main system has three components, DOA estimation and signal validation, beamforming (null steering or multi-beam), and target tracking. The interface is implemented in a modular fashion so that a maximum amount of flexibility is available to test bed users. The test bed was used in conjunction with MATLAB simulations to analyze DOA estimation, beamforming, and nullsteering algorithms necessary to realize a smart antenna system capable of handling multiple users and suppressing nearby strong interference. The results of tests run using the test bed showed that communication delay and hardware limitations on the RF transmission board were a limiting factor in the performance of the smart antenna system.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/panique/PaniqueM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming place at canyon:  politics and settlement creation in Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Papineau, Diane Marie</field><field name="description">Between 1940 and 1970 the cultural landscape of Yellowstone National Park's Canyon development changed dramatically. The government relocated visitor services away from the rims of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone to a new development, inaugurating the National Park Service's Mission 66 redevelopment program. Replacing the 70-year-old, "organically grown," rustic settlement was a Modern, preconceived village resembling 1950s suburbia. This study examines how different generations of Yellowstone visitors have experienced two dramatically disparate and contested versions of Canyon as a park place. The old Canyon settlement was established incrementally and grew organically. It was tied to a geographic point and its pattern evolved through time. Unfortunately, the settlement was built quite close to the canyon's rim. When developments at Canyon were initiated in the 1880s, national parks represented a new responsibility for the federal government-a new type of land use. Entrepreneurial interests and visitor expectations challenged the government's ability to regulate visitor place creation. By the mid-1930s, federal park planning strategies matured and government control strengthened. Planners recognized the undesirable location of Canyon's visitor settlement. The government persuaded park concessioners to move the tourist settlement away from the canyon, motivated in part by the nation's developing preservation ethic. The Mission 66 initiative also encouraged a dramatic reworking of the Canyon area, producing much of the cultural landscape visible today. The formation and evolution of that landscape illustrates the evolving political strength and maturation of federal government stewardship in national parks.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/papineau/PapineauD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of native grasses and cheatgrass on Great Basin forb development</field><field name="creator">Parkinson, Hilary Ann</field><field name="description">Land managers need more information on native forb growth and interactions between forbs and grasses to improve degraded sagebrush steppe habitats in the Great Basin, and to increase the diversity of revegetation seed mixes. This is especially important in areas infested with Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass), an annual grass present in more than 100 million acres of the Great Basin. To gather information on forb growth and measure the effects of both native grasses and B. tectorum on forbs, I conducted a greenhouse experiment with 5 native forbs: Lomatium sp., Eriogonum umbellatum, Machaeranthera canescens, Penstemon speciosus, Sphaeralcea munroana; two native grasses: Elymus elymoides and Poa sandbergii; and B. tectorum. Forbs were grown alone or with a grass, and were harvested after 6, 9 or 12 weeks of growth. Excluding Lomatium, which became dormant before week 12, forbs did not differ in shoot relative growth rate when growing alone, but the root relative growth rate of P. speciosus was 50% greater. Neither native grass reduced the biomass of any forb, but growth rate was reduced for two forbs. In contrast, B. tectorum reduced the biomass and growth rates of all forbs, between 50 and 96%. In a second experiment, to test the ability of native forbs to establish and grow with B. tectorum, 4 forb species were grown in plots seeded with densities ranging from 45-360 B. tectorum plants m -2 at two locations in the Snake River Plain. Water content declined with increasing densities of B. tectorum and forb seedling survival was reduced for 2 species when B. tectorum densities were greater than 150 plants m -2. Reductions in forb biomass greater than 90% occurred for three species when B. tectorum densities were less than 100 plants m -2. This study demonstrated that sites with low expected densities of B. tectorum should be selected when seeding forbs, but that native forbs can establish in sites with B. tectorum densities less than 150 plants m -2, that native grasses and forbs can be used together in seed mixes, and that phonological and morphological characteristics can be used to optimize the diversity of seed mixes.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/parkinson/ParkinsonH0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vascular shutdown as an effect of using photodynamic therpay to treat cancer</field><field name="creator">Pascucci, Elizabeth Mary</field><field name="description">Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment that uses the combination of a photosensitizing drug and light to selectively kill cancer cells. PDT has many potential advantages such as minimal side effects, excellent cosmetic results, and no cellular resistance burdening traditional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. Currently used in the clinic, a limitation is depth of light penetration; therefore, PDT can only be used to treat superficial disease. Our novel PDT agent utilizes two-photon laser technology, which increases the depth of light penetration, greatly increasing the potential uses. Our PDT is able to kill selective cells because the PDT drug has a targeting agent so the drug only goes to cancer cells that overexpress the Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTr2) on their cell surface. Laser light irradiates the cancer cells causing cytotoxic singlet oxygen to be produced damaging the cells. It was observed, through in vivo imaging of the tumors before and after treatment, that vascular flow was diminished as a result of PDT. It is well established that angiogenesis must occur when a tumor reaches a certain size in order for the cells to remain viable and the tumor to continue to grow; therefore, vascular shutdown could be an important mechanism of how PDT works. A series of experiments on the tumor vasculature using in vivo imaging, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy has taken place since this observation to determine what may be happening. Results of these studies have shown that tumor vessels do express the SSTr2 and therefore effected by treatment. Experiments using a somatostatin analog, octreoate, detected by a fluor has shown that the endothelial cells do take the drug up. To ensure that it is blood vessels that were being studied, tumor tissue was stained for both SSTr2 and vonWillebrand Factor (vWF), a recognized endothelial cell marker. Staining patterns for both antibodies were similar. To strengthen the argument, SSTr2- negative tumor cells also showed a positive staining pattern of their vessels, demonstrating that even though the tumor cells are SSTr2- negative, the tumor vessels can be SSTr2-positive and thus responsive to PDT.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/pascucci/PascucciE1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pollinators of slender white prairieclover</field><field name="creator">Pearce, April Marie</field><field name="description">Slender white prairieclover (Dalea candida) is a perennial angiosperm, grown at Bridger plant materials center (BMPC) for reclamation purposes. Interest in the pollinators and pests of this plant developed at BPMC following the death of a 5year old stand. The objectives of these experiments were to (1) determine the diversity and identify the potential pollinators on D. candida and other cultivated and non-cultivated angiosperm species using sweep samples and pan traps; (2) determination of pollen load size and composition of individual insects collected on angiosperm plant species; (3) use of different size exclusion cages to determine the general sizes of insects most important for pollination of D. candida at BPMC; and (4) determine the composition of the community of cavity-nesting Hymenoptera species at BPMC by using trap nests. The overall diversity of BPMC was much higher than expected in a monoculture agriculture area, with a total of 102 Hymenoptera taxa collected. Hill\'s #2 index was used to determine the diversity of different angiosperm plants and revealed that D. candida had the highest diversity. Analysis of pollen loads via the proportion of \"pure\" vs. mixed loads (PBP) and mean proportion of conspecific pollen (PCP) revealed conflicting results between the two measures, but there does appear to be some floral constancy occurring, especially in D. candida. Kruskal-Wallis tests of differences in exclusion cage treatments revealed that there are differences in pollination efficacy and the size subset allowed to reach the flowers. Emergences from trap nests revealed differences in the trap nesting community at BPMC and actual pollinator collections in the field.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/pearce/PearceA0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantative assessment of localized growth rates and gene expression patterns in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms</field><field name="creator">Perez-Osorio, Ailyn Cecilia</field><field name="description">This dissertation work provides evidence of heterogeneity in the distribution of gene expression and growth rates among surface associated cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Currently, methodologies used for characterizing biofilm heterogeneity are constrained by the need of in vitro biofilm growth and by the need to genetically manipulate bacteria. This dissertation describes findings obtained by using LCMM, qRT-PCR, qPCR and microarrays. Through combining LCMM with qRT-PCR a housekeeping gene and two quorum sensing induced genes were found to be differentially expressed at the periphery of P. aeruginosa biofilms. qPCR also enabled the growth rate of cells in discrete locations of biofilms to be determined. Cells localized to the deep layers of biofilms were found in a growth state analogous to stationary phase in planktonic cultures, while cells localized to the biofilm periphery were slightly more active with growth rates that approached cells growing exponentially in planktonic cultures. By elucidating the growth rates of subpopulations within the biofilm it was subsequently possible to determine that the most active cells had approximately 7 copies of the mRNA of housekeeping and stationary phase associated genes. Each of the least active cells, those found in the deeper sections of the biofilms, had less than one copy of any of the mRNAs measured. No significant differences in the distribution of 16S rRNA were found along the sections analyzed. The microarray studies revealed several genes, known to be involved in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa, to be undergoing active transcription in young biofilms under conditions of low calcium concentrations. This is significant because calcium homeostasis is known to be out of balance in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, where P. aeruginosa biofilms grow causing life threatening infections. These results suggest that spatial and temporal heterogeneity within biofilms underscores their ability to not only survive in diverse and sometimes harsh environmental conditions, but to exploit those environments. The methods described in this work are suitable for characterizing heterogeneity of gene expression and growth rate in biofilms collected from their natural environment. These also represent an alternative method for assessing the distribution of populations in multispecies biofilms.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/perez-osorio/Perez-OsorioA1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scarp analysis of the Centennial Normal Fault, Beaverhead County, Montana and Fremont County, Idaho</field><field name="creator">Petrik, Falene Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The Centennial Mountains are an east-west trending mountain range in southwest Montana. The Centennial Mountains are bound on the south by the Eastern Snake River Plane, the north-trending Madison Range and fault on the east and the Centennial Valley on the north. The Centennial normal fault offsets the Centennial Mountains on the north down-dropping the Centennial Valley. Approximately 3000 meters of offset along the Centennial normal fault creates the Centennial Mountains. The present Centennial Mountains are subdivided into two stratigraphically different blocks by the Odell Creek normal fault. The eastern Centennial Mountains are interpreted as the upthrown block of the Odell Creek normal fault exposing Precambrian and Paleozoic rock along the northern face of the range. The western Centennial Mountains are interpreted as the downthrown block of the Odell Creek normal fault exposing Cretaceous and younger rocks. Both eastern and western segments of the Centennial Mountains are then offset along the range bounding Centennial normal fault. Offset along the Centennial normal fault started approximately 2.1 Ma as evidenced by the displacement of the 2.1 Ma Huckleberry Ridge tuff. It is believed that prior to the emplacement of the 2.1 Ma Huckleberry Ridge tuff, the Centennial Mountains had minimum to no surface relief. The majority of offset along the Centennial normal fault has occurred with in the late Pleistocene with estimated slip rates of 0.65-0.82 mm/yr. The late Pleistocene surface offsets along the Centennial Mountains have an average of 9.1-9.6 meters with similar offset seen along the eastern and western segments.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/petrik/PetrikF0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roust schedules and disruption management for job shops</field><field name="creator">Philip, Deepu</field><field name="description">This dissertation documents the results of research evaluating policies to schedule for unanticipated disruptions in job shops. The disruptions studied in this research are of two types - machine failure and job release-time. The study was conducted using modified classical job shop problems with the minimize maximum completion time (Cmax) objective. Best random non-delay schedules (BRS) provided job sequences for each machine. Different slack policies based on frequency, duration and location of slacks in the schedule were used to strategically insert slack in the BRS schedule. The resulting robust schedules proactively managed machine or job releasetime disruptions. The change in Cmax quantified schedule robustness. Simulation was used to generate and modify the BRS schedules with and without slacks and disruptions, simulate disruption events and evaluate schedule performance. It was observed that policies that equally distribute slack to all tasks on heavily utilized machines and those that equally distribute slack to all tasks on all machines performed best. When the number of jobs to process was more than the number of machines and "big jobs" with long processing times on heavily utilized machines were present, the policy distributing slack tasks equally on heavily utilized machines exhibited superior performance. For systems with less variability both policies performed equally well. By comparing the average, minimum and maximum schedule deviations across all policies, the study concluded that strategically distributing slack to tasks on heavily utilized machines results in good robust schedules that can absorb the effects of disruptions.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/philip/PhilipD0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">We are still talking the wrong language to \'tv babies\'</field><field name="creator">Pieczenik, Sharon Rovner</field><field name="description">In order to reach a young generation diagnosed with \"nature deficit disorder\" and flooded with mass media messages from a myriad of channels, non governmental organizations (NGOs) and environmental educators need to embrace musical videos as a tool for conservation education. Rare Conservation is one NGO that utilizes music videos as an innovative technique to reach a younger audience in order to foster a sense of pride and concern for the environment in which they live. In 1992, RARE Conservation produced a music video for the song \"Quincy Rap\" by Tony (The Obeah Man) McKay. The \"Quincy Rap\" music video was one environmental tool in the overall campaign to save the endangered and endemic Bahamian Parrot. By analyzing the \"Quincy Rap\" music video, a guideline for creating persuasive music videos can be constructed. In order to analyze a music video, like \"Quincy Rap,\" it is best to take a multi-perspective approach, first dissecting the visual elements of the video then looking at the audio elements and then concluding with how the visual and audio elements intersect. By juxtaposing music video techniques with those found in other forms of video production, certain persuasive elements of music video production can be highlighted. This unique rhetoric of music videos can be utilized as persuasive environmental education.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/pieczenik/PieczenikS0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iphone to IMAX: the social implications of screen size</field><field name="creator">Potter, George Alexander</field><field name="description">Screen size changes the way the moving image affects viewers and specific content is more likely to be influential if screened on the most appropriate media type.

This fact has not been lost on environmental filmmakers who are increasingly finding ways of using different sized screens to promote their cause.

In this dissertation, we used a 35-year dataset to investigate variations in body mass of Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay, Antarctica with goals of linking environmental conditions, body mass, and reproductive performance. We predicted that variations in environmental conditions and maternal traits would correlate with variations in maternal body mass at parturition, and that variations in maternal body mass may be linked with offspring's body mass and survival probability. We found maternal body mass at parturition showed substantial age- and environmental-related variations. Maternal body mass increased with age through the young and middle ages, and evidence of senescent declines in body mass was found amongst the oldest ages. Additionally, body mass at parturition was strongly influenced by environmental variations during the pregnancy period, specifically body mass was negatively correlated with sea-ice extent and positively correlated with the Southern Oscillation. Annually, pup weaning mass was highly variable. Pup weaning mass was negatively correlated with summer sea-ice extent and positively correlated with summer Southern Oscillation, and these two variables explained 86% of the annual variation in the population average weaning mass. Weaning mass was positively correlated with juvenile survival probability, particularly for males, and we estimated the odds of a male surviving from weaning to age 3 increased 7.3% for every 10 additional kilograms of body mass accrued by weaning. Together, these results suggest large-scale atmospheric-oceanographic variations may affect Weddell seal maternal foraging success and ultimately reproductive performance. Finally, we investigated statistical methodologies accounting for measurement error in photogrammetrically estimated body mass with goals of developing techniques to employ estimated body mass as a covariate in simple linear regression models. We demonstrated that error associated with estimating body mass induces bias in regression statistics and decreases model explanatory power and we described simple statistical techniques accounting for measurement error in covariates. These statistical developments may allow future studies to employ photogrammetric mass estimation techniques and utilize estimated body mass as a covariate in ecological modeling exercises.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/proffitt/ProffittK0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrification in premise plumbing systems</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Mohammad Shahedur</field><field name="description">Monochloramine is increasingly used instead of free chlorine as a secondary disinfectant. Ammonia is introduced into water for monochloramine formation or by decay. Nitrification can have deleterious effects on water quality that may lead to regulatory violations. In this project water quality and influence of pipe material on the onset of nitrification and consequences of nitrification in premise plumbing were investigated. Also potential control strategies for nitrification were evaluated. Initially two types of copper coupons (new and old, i.e., pre-exposed to 0.1N NaOH solution) were used with water of two different carbon (2~4ppm) and ammonianitrogen (0.36~0.71ppm) concentrations. In the next experiment, pre-aged copper and PVC coupons were used with high carbon (4 ppm) and two ammonia concentrations (0.36 and 0.71 ppm). When all reactors showed complete signs of nitrification the ammonia concentration in low ammonia (0.36 ppm) feed reactors were raised to the high level (0.71 ppm). The PVC reactors were quicker in adjusting to this change. Next, the effect of copper ion, chlorite and chloramine on nitrifying simulated household plumbing systems was investigated. No significant effect of copper on nitrification was observed. Chlorite was not effective on the PVC system but inhibited the copper system at 20 ppm. Nitrification activity was also impacted significantly at a 5:1 ratio of chlorine to ammonia and ultimately stopped. To investigate the effect of nutrient conditions on metal release in a nitrifying system and the consequences of change in microbial population, influent humic and ammonia concentrations of two reactors of each set were raised to 8 ppm and 2.13 ppm respectively. Higher ammonia increased only the autotrophs while higher TOC increased only the heterotrophs. For all reactors alkalinity and pH decreased due to nitrification, with lesser effect on copper reactors. Increased TOC or nitrogen increased the copper concentration in the water. The microbial population was analyzed by PCR and DGGE. The biofilm community composition is influenced by nutrient condition and pipe material and environmental stress (chlorite or monochloramine). The presence of copper in the PVC reactor did not cause any impact on community composition.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/rahman/RahmanM0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The two-component signal transduction systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="creator">Richard, Jessica</field><field name="description">Two-component signal transduction systems are important components for bacteria, because they allow the bacteria to sense environmental conditions and rapidly adapt to changes in the environment. Two-component systems generally contain a sensor histidine kinase, which detects an environmental signal and responds by autophosphorylation at a histidine residue using ATP as the phosphate donor. The phosphate group is then transferred to an aspartate residue in the receiver domain of the second component, the response regulator, which in its activated form responds by stimulating or repressing gene expression or motility, as needed for the physiological responses of the cell. The structural versatility of two-component systems reflects the wide range of signals to which bacteria respond. Despite this versatility, histidine kinases and response regulators show a conserved mechanism of signal transfer. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile organism that can use a variety of nutrient sources and is found in many different environments. It is a human pathogen in nosocomial infections as well as in pulmonary fluid of patients with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa encodes genes for over 60 two-component regulatory systems. In this review, I discuss the structure and function of two-component systems in bacteria, and conduct a phylogenetic analysis of the P. aerugionsa two-component systems. Finally, I develop a model of the calcium-responsive two-component system of P. aeruginosa, PA2656/PA2657, which is closely related to the magnesium responsive PmrAB and phosphate responsive PhoPQ two-component systems. The results provide insight on how P. aeruginosa is able to detect and respond to changing environmental conditions.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/richard/RichardJ0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus fertility in Northern Great Plains dryland organic cropping systems</field><field name="creator">Rick, Terry Lynn</field><field name="description">Maintaining phosphorus (P) fertility in northern Great Plains (NGP) dryland organic cropping systems is a challenge due to high pH, calcareous soils that limit P bioavailability. Organic P fertilizers, including rock phosphate (RP) and bone meal (BM) are sparingly soluble in higher pH soils. Certain crops species have demonstrated an ability to mobilize sparingly soluble P sources. Objectives of this project were to 1) evaluate the effect of green manure (GM) crops and organic P fertilizers on the P nutrition of subsequent crops, and 2) investigate P fertility differences between organic and non-organic cropping systems. A two-year cropping sequence was conducted on an organic farm in north-central Montana (mean pH=6.6; Olsen P=16 mg kg&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1;). Spring pea (Pisum sativum L), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum L.), yellow mustard (Sinapis alba L.) and tilled fallow were fertilized with 0, 3.1 and 7.7 kg P ha&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; as RP, grown to flat pod stage and terminated with tillage. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown on these plots in year two.

Results indicate buckwheat can enhance P in a subsequent crop. A greenhouse pot experiment in a low P soil (Olsen P=4 mg kg&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1;) consisted of four green manures; buckwheat, spring pea, wheat, and a non-crop control fertilized with 7.0 and 17.5 kg available P ha&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; as RP, 13.0 and 32.5 kg available P ha&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; as BM and 10 and 25 kg available P ha&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; as monocalcium phosphate (MCP). Green manures were harvested, dried, analyzed for nutrient content, and returned to pots. Pots were seeded with wheat. Phosphorus uptake in wheat following all crops was enhanced by MCP (P&lt;0.05). Phosphorus uptake of wheat following buckwheat was enhanced by all P sources over the control. Buckwheat demonstrates the capacity to increase the availability of organic P fertilizers. Soil sampling of organic and non-organic no-tillage (NT) cropping systems was conducted in two separate studies to determine differences in P availability between management systems. Soil analysis determined available P tends to be lower in non-fertilized systems.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/rick/RickT1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrologic-carbon cycle linkages in a subalpine catchment</field><field name="creator">Riveros-Iregui, Diego Andres</field><field name="description">The feedbacks between the water and the carbon cycles are of critical importance to global carbon balances. Forests and forest soils in northern latitudes are important carbon pools because of their potential as sinks for atmospheric carbon. However there are significant unknowns related to the effects of hydrologic variability, mountainous terrain, and landscape heterogeneity in controlling soil carbon dioxide (CO 2) efflux. Mountainous terrain imposes large spatial heterogeneity in the biophysical controls of soil CO 2 production and efflux, including soil temperature, soil water content, vegetation, substrate, and soil physical properties. Strong spatial and temporal variability in biophysical controls can lead to large heterogeneity in the magnitude of soil CO 2 efflux. This dissertation research investigates the relationships between these biophysical controls and the resultant CO 2 efflux across the soil-atmosphere interface in a 393-ha subalpine catchment of the Northern Rocky Mountains. This study incorporates knowledge gained through field observations (2 growing seasons) at multiple locations distributed across the watershed, and a range of empirical analytical techniques including a modeling approach to estimate point to catchment scale soil CO 2 efflux. Variability in soil CO 2 efflux was strongly related to topography and landscape structure. Riparian meadows were found to have the highest rates of cumulative soil CO 2 efflux across the entire watershed, likely due to more accumulation of soil water than upland sites, leading to enhanced plant and microbial respiration in riparian meadows. Landscape context and appreciation of organized heterogeneity are critical to estimation and interpretation of watershed-scale rates of soil CO 2 efflux and for up-scaling plot or point measurements of soil CO 2 efflux to larger spatial scales. This dissertation provides examples and suggestions for corroboration and integration of soil and canopy level CO 2 fluxes and for process understanding of spatiotemporal variability of biogeochemical processes driven by the hydrologic cycle.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/riveros-iregui/Riveros-IreguiD1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of colostrum from safflower supplemented ewes on lamb cold tolerance and lamb growth</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Brenda Lee</field><field name="description">Five hundred, ninety-seven and 643 white face range ewes were used in a 2 year study, respectively, in a 3-way factorial arrangement to determine effect of supplemental linoleic oil on lamb serum metabolites, thermogenesis and lamb growth.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rodents mimics MS. Mucosal treatment of EAE with antigens to induce tolerance is effective, but requires large and/or multiple administrations, which introduces an allergy risk. We utilized reovirus adhesin, protein sigma 1 (p sigma1), to improve mucosal auto-antigen delivery and show that a single low-dose of p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-based vaccines induces tolerance and prevents autoimmunity when administered nasally. We engineered three p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-based vaccines carrying chicken ovalbumin (OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1) and/or myelin antigens (PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1, MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1). When mice were nasally immunized with OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1, tolerance to OVA was established. This tolerance resisted co-administration of mucosal adjuvants and peripheral challenge with OVA. P&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-mediated tolerance relied upon specific IL-10- producing regulatory T (Treg) cells, which inhibited OVA-specific CD4+ T cell proliferation. OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1 did not generate tolerance in IL-10-deficient mice presumably by a failure to induce Treg cells. Mucosal, but not systemic p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1 delivery, induced tolerance, while mice lacking mucosal inductive tissues were resistant to p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-mediated tolerance. Likewise, PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1 and MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1 protected mice against relapsing-remitting or acute EAE, respectively. Protection against PLP 139-151-induced EAE was accomplished by PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1, but not OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1, implicating antigen-specificity of p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-mediated tolerance. Moreover, MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1, but not PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1, ameliorated MOG 35-55-induced EAE via apoptosis of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells. The PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1- or MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-mediated protection against EAE depends on specific IL-10+ Treg cells and is supported by IL-4+ Th2-type cells. Adoptive transfer of PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-primed Treg cells entirely prevented EAE development in mice; however, transfer of PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-specific CD25-CD4 + Th2 cells significantly reduced and delayed clinical EAE. Aggressive EAE, due to the TGF-&amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2; which induced activation of Th17 cells, was observed in mice dosed with PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1 and were functionally depleted of Treg cells. Concomitant inactivation of TGF-&amp;Icirc;&amp;sup2; and Treg cells induced Th2 cells bias and re-established PLP:OVA-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-mediated protection against EAE. IL-10-producing B cells supported MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-mediated protection against EAE, as MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-dosed B cell-deficient mice developed attenuated disease. Adoptive transfer of Treg cells, but not Th2 or B cells from MOG-p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-dosed B6 mice to diseased IL-10-/- mice, significantly accelerated recovery from EAE. These data demonstrate the feasibility of using p&amp;Iuml;&#402;1-based single-dose delivery system to prevent and/or treat autoimmunity.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/rynda/RyndaA0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principals' perceptions of mentoring in Montana's AA, A, and B high schools</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Godfrey Eugene</field><field name="description">Mentoring programs have become a popular source of training and professional development for high school principals over the past few years (Darish, 2001). However, there is little research which investigates the types of mentoring support these programs provide and the effectiveness of this support (SREB, 2007). This mixed methods study was undertaken to determine the frequency of mentoring support that high school and assistant principals in Montana's AA, A and B schools experienced during their beginning years as building administrations. In addition, this study also investigated principals' perceptions of the main sources of mentoring support and to describe the support strategies that principals used in the absence of mentoring. One hundred and twenty-two high school principals and assistant principals were sent the School Administration and Leaderships Skills Inventory (SALSS) (Stout, 2001) and asked to rate their perceptions of mentoring support during their novice years as building administrators. Results from this research found that when averaged across the ISLLC Leadership Skill domains, 95% of lead principals and assistant principals indicated that mentoring support would have been beneficial during their induction years as building administrators. Follow-up interviews were conducted with five principals were to more fully understand the sources of administrative support that were available to the support strategies that they used in the absence of mentoring. Results from semistructured interviews identified, "Supportive Peer Administrators", "Personality Traits", "Self-Development" and "Experience" as themes that described principals' sources of administrative support. "Creating Supportive Relationships", "Reflection", and "Supportive Peer Administrators" were the themes that principals collectively used to describe the support strategies they used in the absence of formal or informal mentoring. Results from this study suggest that there is a lack of mentoring support networks novice high school principals practicing in the state of Montana. Findings from this research suggest that Montana's school districts and the university principal preparation programs need to make a concerted effort to establish formal mentoring programs for new school administrators. It is recommended that these organizations work collaboratively to mentoring support networks for novice principals and to use the findings from this study to guide those efforts.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/saunders/SaundersG0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of a stem boring weevil, Mecinus janthinus, on dalmation toadflax, Linaria dalmatica</field><field name="creator">Schat, Marjolein</field><field name="description">Classical biological control of weeds is generally considered an effective, safe, and cost effective tool for controlling widespread weeds in natural areas. However, only 60% of releases have become established and, of those, only 50% have led to control. Therefore, understanding the impacts of agents on target weeds across spatial scales, at different insect densities, and over time can give biological control practitioners the knowledge necessary to improve establishment and success rates. My studies characterized the impacts the biological control agent, Mecinus janthinus, on the rangeland weed Dalmatian toadflax (Linaria dalmatica) at individual plant and plant population scales. Individual plant studies were conducted in a garden and replicated on plants growing in the field, to measure the impact of agents on plant growth and primary physiology. The population study followed operational scale releases of M. janthinus for three to four years using intensive monitoring to characterize L. dalmatica cover, density, and population structure, and weevil establishment and population increase. I also evaluated which parameters were most important to measure to determine establishment and success. In the common garden experiment, M. janthinus injury was found to reduce relative plant growth, as well as root, stem, and reproductive biomass at medium and high adult densities. Trends of reduced photosynthetic, conductance, or transpiration rates with increasing M. janthinus density were observed. In the field experiment, M. janthinus injury led to reduced growth. Gas exchange rates decreased over the season and were lower in plants exposed to high larval and adult herbivore pressure. Field monitoring indicated successful M. janthinus establishment at releases across a range of elevations, slopes, and geographic locations, though high rates of overwintering mortality were observed at all sites. Linaria dalmatica cover was variable within watersheds and patches, and also differed between watersheds. Abundance of L. dalmatica decreased over time based on cover measurements, but did not change over time with respect to density. The proportion of mature L. dalmatica stems decreased over time. The majority of changes in L. dalmatica over time were the same in release and control transects and could not be attributed to M. janthinus.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/schat/SchatM1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taphonomy of the Sun River Bonebed, Late Cretaceous (Campanian) Two Medicine Formation of Montana</field><field name="creator">Scherzer, Benjamin Andrew</field><field name="description">In the summer of 1998, a bonebed of juvenile dinosaur material was found in beds of the Two Medicine Formation along the Sun River in Teton County, Montana. Initial inspection of the \"Sun River Bonebed\" indicated unique dominance by juvenile remains and unusually high concentration of fossil material. Modern exposure of both the bonebed and surrounding strata allowed for a detailed taphonomic study of the assemblage. In the summer of 2004, the bonebed was excavated in a fashion that recorded depthwise taphonomic data of fossil material and surrounding sediment, and allowed for three-dimensional reconstruction of the bonebed. The lithology of the surrounding beds was documented for 120 m immediately below and 40 m immediately above the bonebed to interpret the overall depositional environment of the area. Lastly, the paleobiologic and sedimentologic interpretations made for the bonebed were compared to bonebeds of similar fauna in the Two Medicine Formation. Taphonomic attributes of the fossil material indicate a mass death assemblage of late juvenile lambeosaurines subject to post-mortem bioturbation and possible fluvial transport. A number of elements from the assemblage exhibit a rare form of taphonomic modification known as \"wet rot,\" currently documented in only one other dinosaur bonebed. Sedimentologic and additional taphonomic data in the assemblage indicate entrainment of the vertebrate material in a cohesive debris flow and ultimate deposition in the respective flow deposit. The sedimentology of the surrounding beds indicates ultimate deposition in an ephemeral fluvial environment. The restricted age class representation of the assemblage lends credence to existing paleobiologic interpretations of hadrosaurids in the Late Cretaceous of Montana, and the Sun River Bonebed is significant in its exhibition of \"wet rot\" modification and in being one of a restricted number of documented debris-flow hosted vertebrate bonebeds.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/scherzer/ScherzerB0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental concentrations, fate, and risk assessment of insecticides used for adult mosquito management</field><field name="creator">Schleier, Jerome Joseph III</field><field name="description">One of the most effective ways of managing adult mosquitoes that vector human and animal pathogens is the use of ultra-low-volume (ULV) insecticides. Due to a lack of studies examining the environmental fate of ULV insecticides and because previous risk assessments have shown that environmental concentrations of insecticides contributed the largest amount of variance to the estimated total exposure, I measured deposition onto surfaces and air concentrations of permethrin and naled. I also conducted risk assessments for human and other non-target organisms using the values I measured. Deposition concentrations of permethrin and naled generally decreased as distance from the spray source increased. Overall, approximately 3.2% of the permethrin and 15% of the naled applied deposited on the ground within 75 m from the spray source 1 h after application. Concentrations of permethrin and naled 12 h after application were not significantly different than concentrations 1 h after application. The results of my probabilistic human-health risk assessment using actual environmental concentrations showed that previous risk assessments overestimated risks. Thus they were conservative in protecting human health. The non-target risk assessment and field bioassay using the house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.), as a surrogate for medium- to large-bodied ground dwelling insects showed that ULV applications most likely would not result in impacts on populations. I also measured actual environmental concentrations of pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) after aerial ULV applications. Pyrethrins were not detected in the water or on deposition pads. However PBO was detected in the water and on deposition samples, but concentrations rapidly decreased to background levels by 36 h after application. The estimated risks of pyrethrins and PBO to aquatic surrogates were lower than those estimated by previous ecological risk assessments. My study is the first to relate actual environmental concentrations of ULV insecticides to estimates of human-health risks. Results of my environmental fate studies, human-health and non-target risk assessments, and the current weight of scientific evidence, demonstrate that the risks to humans and the environment after ULV applications of insecticides most likely are below regulatory levels of concern.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/schleier/SchleierJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damage initiation and post-damage response of composite laminates by multiaxial testing and nonlinear optimization</field><field name="creator">Schmitt, James Tyler</field><field name="description">Fiber reinforced plastics are increasingly being used in the construction of primary structures in the aerospace and energy industries. While their elastic behavior and fatigue response have been the subject of considerable research, less is known about the performance of continuous fiber composites following initial damage. Several competing models for the post-damage response of orthotropic composite materials are explored in this thesis. Each of these models includes only the in-plane loads experienced by the material and characterizes damage based on the local state of strain. Starting with previous work performed at the Naval Research Laboratory and at MSU, the energy dissipated in multiaxially loaded coupons was used to optimize an empirical function that relates the three in-plane strains to the local dissipated energy density. This function was used to approximate a three dimensional damage initiation envelope as well as to quantify the severity of damage following first ply failure in a fiberglass laminate. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy was characterized using an assumed bilinear constitutive response. The elastic properties of the material were first optimized to minimize deviation from experimental data and then the necessary coefficients for a per-axis strain softening response were found using a similar optimization. This model provides detailed insight into the residual strength of significantly damaged material, as well as dissipated energy as a direct consequence. To facilitate the need of these models for diverse local in-plane loading configurations, the MSU In-Plane Loader (IPL) was utilized. The tests performed in the IPL for this thesis were instrumental in validating a new image-correlation-based displacement monitoring system.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/schmitt/SchmittJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A descriptive study of childhood obesity monitoring practices used by Montana pediatric providers</field><field name="creator">Schwarzkopf, Nancy Denise</field><field name="description">INTRODUCTION: The global prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing. Overweight children face risks of compromised physical and mental well being, increased incidence of disease processes, and increased risk of adult obesity. Pediatric providers play a unique role in reversing the prevalence of obesity, yet there is little understanding of what practices are utilized to monitor children\'s weight. PROBLEM: Identifying children who are obese or are at risk for becoming obese may rely on evidence based weight monitoring practices. For many providers there may be a gap in knowledge regarding recommended practices for measuring growth in children. The purpose of this study was to describe current practices for monitoring obesity of children used by Montana primary pediatric providers. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using a mailed pencil and paper survey, sent to 300 primary pediatric providers in Montana selected from 900 Child Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) providers. Eighty-five surveys were returned for a response rate of 28%. Data analysis utilized SAS software; results were analyzed using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: A total of 85.7% of respondents offered care in family practice settings; 17.6% are pediatric specialists, 31.8% are practicing rurally and 57.6% of providers saw 5 or fewer children/per day. Over 95% of providers measured height and weight, 61.2% calculated body mass index (BMI). Just 55.8% of those who measure BMI accurately plotted it on age/gender specific chart, or 34% of total respondents. All respondents perceived childhood obesity as a concern, with patient/parent resistance cited as the most common barrier to treatment. CONCLUSION: Health disparities in Montana associated with rural populations include fewer pediatric specialists, fewer child healthcare visits, and barriers of access, education level and money for patient and their families. In Montana, height and weight measurements are used predominately to monitor children\'s growth; BMI was accurately used by one third of respondents which may interfere with the provider\'s ability to accurately identify adiposity. These findings suggest a focus area for provider education, promoting BMI guidelines for children. Perceptions of barriers: patient/parent resistance, time constraints, and reimbursement; suggest treatment protocols could improve outcomes for childhood obesity.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/schwarzkopf/SchwarzkopfN0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated radio network design using ant colony optimization</field><field name="creator">Sharkey, Jeffrey Allen</field><field name="description">Radio networks can provide reliable communication for rural intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Engineers manually design these radio networks by selecting tower locations and equipment while meeting a series of constraints such as coverage, bandwidth, maximum delay, and redundancy, all while minimizing network cost. As network size and constraints grow, the design process can quickly become overwhelming. In this thesis we model the network design problem (NDP) as a generalized Steiner tree-star (GSTS) problem. Any solution to the minimum Steiner tree (MST) problem on a constructed GSTS graph will directly identify the tower locations and equipment needed to build the network at an optimal cost. The direct MST solution can only satisfy coverage constraints. Because the MST problem is known to be NP-hard, our research applies ant colony optimization (ACO) to find near-optimal MST solutions. Using ACO also allows us to meet bandwidth, maximum delay, and redundancy constraints. We verify that our approach finds near-optimal designs by comparing it against a 2-approximation algorithm in several different scenarios.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/sharkey/SharkeyJ0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Armored stanchion cattle water access effects on E. coli, suspended sediment, and nutrient loading to spring creeks</field><field name="creator">Sigler, William Adam</field><field name="description">Livestock grazing activities contribute to impairment of 5,200 miles of Montana streams. Implementation of most water quality improvement efforts addressing this issue is voluntary. Thus, it is important to present land owners with simple, cost effective approaches to mitigate water quality impairment. An armored stanchion (AS) water access was designed, implemented, and tested on Thompson and Story Creeks near Belgrade, MT. Riparian fencing was constructed to allow access at a water gap where the AS was constructed. The AS allows animals to access spring creek water to drink but does not allow them to enter the stream. An AS was constructed adjacent to a traditional (TRAD) water access on each stream for comparison. Water quality impairment was quantified downstream of each access with and without animals actively using the accesses. Instantaneous loads of E. coli, suspended sediment concentration (SSC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO3), total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate (PO4) were evaluated using Kruskal Wallis procedures. Contaminant loading from the AS access was not significantly greater than loading from the control with or without animals present. The Story Site did not consistently produce significant differences for the TRAD access with animals present versus absent under the different analysis approaches employed. Results at the Thompson Site produced significant differences for E. coli, TKN, and TP for the TRAD access when animals were present versus absent from the access. Estimates were made of percentage of time cattle occupied the Thompson TRAD access. These estimates facilitated calculation of daily loads attributed to animals actively using the access. For E. coli the load was 6.0 E9 CFU per day, 425.9 g per day for TKN, and 53.1 g per day for TP. These results indicate the AS access can reduce water quality impacts from cattle, compared to traditional access methods.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/sigler/SiglerW0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frontier residents' perceptions of health care access</field><field name="creator">Smith, Raymond Joshua</field><field name="description">It can be difficult to access health care due to cost, lack of insurance, and lack of available resources for Americans today. Frontier persons have even more obstacles in accessing health care due to geography, time and distance to facilities, lack of medical personal, and culture. This study's purpose was to better understand frontier residents' perceptions of access to health care. Specific aims were to (a) explore frontier residents' health care access resources, (b) investigate frontier residents' utilization of health care services, (c) search for reasons frontier residents seek health care (d) and explore the residents' overall satisfaction regarding their health care access options. A qualitative approach that included open-ended questions was used to interview a convenience sample of 11 frontier residents in a Southwestern Montana town. Participants were recruited using a snowball approach. Common themes were extracted using a "low inference" analysis style. Aday and Andersen's framework and their study of access to medical care (1975) guided the study. Results revealed most residents felt they had access to health care and all had seen a provider in the last 2 years. Residents used "local" services, the closest being 70 miles away, for minor ailments and injuries or when home remedies failed. A "by-pass" mentality of "local" services was seen for more serious events. Children were treated differently and health care was sought sooner if they became ill. Reasons for seeking care included preventative services, acute injuries, and infectious processes. Cost, weather, road conditions, gas prices, travel time, and taking time off work were mentioned as barriers in health care utilization. Insurance deductibles and costs of health services limited the type of health care residents sought. Satisfactions with health care providers were high as well as sliding scale fees of the local health centers. Cost and distance were unsatisfactory. Implications for practice include educating residents about benefits and abilities of their local resources, the need to seek care for preventative services, health promotion topics, and disease prevention. In addition, health care authorities should focus on alternative ways to bring health care to the frontier residents including telemedicine and lowering costs.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/smith/SmithR0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual precipitation-runoff modeling suite:  model selection, calibration and predictive uncertainty assessment</field><field name="creator">Smith, Tyler Jon</field><field name="description">In Montana and much of the Rocky Mountain West, the single most important parameter in forecasting the controls on regional water resources is snowpack. Despite the heightened importance of snowpack, few studies have considered the representation of uncertainty in coupled snowmelt/hydrologic conceptual models. Uncertainty estimation provides a direct interpretation of the risk associated with predictive modeling results. Bayesian inference, through the application of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, provides a statistical means of approximating uncertainty associated with both the parameters and the model structure. This thesis addresses the complexities of predictive modeling in hydrology through the development, implementation and analysis of a suite of conceptual hydrologic models under a Bayesian inference framework. The research is presented in four main sections. First, a comparative assessment of three recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, based on their performance across two case studies, is performed. This study has revealed that the extreme complexity of the parameter space associated with simple, conceptual models is best explored by the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Second, a complete description of the models and study site incorporated in the study are presented, building on established theories of model development. Third, an investigation of the value of each model structure, considering predictive performance, uncertainty and physical realism is presented. This section builds on results of the first section, through the application of the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm for model calibration and uncertainty quantification under Bayesian principles. Finally, a discussion of the Simulation and Prediction Lab for Analysis of Snowmelt Hydrology, developed to incorporate the tasks of model selection, calibration and uncertainty analysis into a simple graphical user interface is explained. The application of a complete modeling framework from model selection to calibration and assessment presented in this thesis represents a holistic approach to the development of improved understanding of snow-dominated watersheds through prediction by coupled snowmelt/hydrologic modeling strategies.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/smith/SmithT1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The open and the still: mourning in thought</field><field name="creator">Spahr, Travis Osborne</field><field name="description">This project is an architectural study of the practice of mourning and the pursuit of the humble heart.

To aid in the detection of proteins at lower concentrations, DIGE dyes, a family of spectrally resolved fluorescent dyes, are currently available to proteomic researchers for 2D gel analysis. However, the demands of protein detection dictate that dyes that are even more sensitive and versatile be created. The syntheses of highly sensitive, water soluble BODIPY fluorophore dyes are described. These dyes are proposed to have the necessary sensitivity to allow for detection of proteins in much lower concentrations, providing an improvement over current protein detection limits. The BODIPY dyes that have been synthesized are available in a variety of absorbances and emissions. While fluorescent dyes that are amine-reactive are the most popular covalently binding protein labeling markers being used in today's proteomic research, thiol-reactive fluorescent markers are gaining importance in proteomic research. Since thiol residues are less common in proteins compared to their amine counterparts, saturation labeling and quantification are more easily achieved. The syntheses of sensitive thiol- reactive fluorescent dyes are described. These syntheses allow for quick generation of thiol-reactive fluorescent markers to be used in proteomic research.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/spicka/SpickaK0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Slope scale modeling of snow surface temperature in topographically complex terrain</field><field name="creator">Staples, James Mark</field><field name="description">In mountainous terrain, landscape can influences the thermal state of snow. Snow temperature and mass flux have been calculated using an energy balance model, Radtherm/RT, to account for the effects of topography and meteorological conditions. For a specific location, a terrain model is defined and contains a connected assemblage of elements or facets. Each element has a specified terrain type with assigned thermal properties. Meteorological data are applied, and a one dimensional energy balance is calculated for each element. This energy balance includes conduction, convection, radiation, and latent heat; however, the calculation of radiation is unique. Taking into account topography, global position, and time, the model is used to calculate incoming solar radiation for each element as well as reflected short wave radiation and the exchange of long wave radiation between terrain surfaces. Light detection and ranging topographic data with a one meter resolution were used to create separate models (on the order of 10 4 m2) for two slopes in southwest Montana. Meteorological data were collected at these two slopes as well as a third location having a relatively unobstructed view of the sky. The results for elements in different locations and under different meteorological conditions were compared. Readily available USGS topographic data with a 30 meter resolution were used to create a model (on the order of 10 6 m2) containing both slopes. For this model of a much larger scale, surface temperatures and mass flux were again calculated and compared with results for the slope scale models. Incoming long wave radiation from the atmosphere only was found to be critical input data for accurate temperature calculations. The set value for albedo also had a major effect. When suitable long wave data and good estimations of albedo were used, snow surface temperature was calculated with accuracies on the order of several degrees. Additionally, when surface hoar deposition and growth was observed and reasonable temperature results were achieved, calculated values of mass flux were consistently positive. In one instance, observed variations in surface hoar growth across a slope matched calculated variations in mass flux across the same slope.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/staples/StaplesJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pathogenicity of Fusarium spp. to Wheat Stem Sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae)</field><field name="creator">Sun, Zhitan</field><field name="description">The wheat stem sawfly is the most destructive insect pest in both winter wheat and spring wheat production in the northern Great Plains. The sawfly is univoltine, and spends all immature stages within protective wheat stems, which explains the difficulty in controlling populations. However, the almost continuous inhabitation of stems also makes larvae more vulnerable to invasion by microorganisms colonizing both living stems and postharvest stubble. Fusarium spp. were frequently isolated from fungalcolonized larval cadavers, and were found to be the major lethal factors for overwintering larvae in both laboratory emergence experiments and field surveys over three years. The pathogenicity of single isolates of three Fusarium spp., including F. pseudograminearum, F. culmorum, and F. acuminatum, was evaluated against overwintering larvae in sawflycut stems and against actively-feeding larvae in growing winter wheat plants over two years. The tested Fusarium isolates caused twenty to sixty percent mortality in overwintering larvae, and caused forty to eighty percent mortality in actively-feeding larvae. The Fusarium isolates also caused decomposition of sawfly-cut stems and disease in wheat plants, which reflected the versatility of Fusarium isolates acting as saprophytes, entomopathogens, and phytopathogens. Deoxynivalenol was detected in wheat stem tissues colonized by the Fusarium isolates from two years of field experiments, and deoxynivalenol caused toxicity and inhibited the growth of second and third-instar actively-feeding larvae in laboratory bioassays. Wheat grower observations of greater sawfly infestation in dryland wheat fields led to assessment of larval mortality from Fusarium infection in both dryland and irrigated wheat fields. This was studied using cage experiments or field surveys at different locations for three years. Parasitoid attack and fungal infection, mainly by Fusarium spp., were found to be the major lethal factors for developing and overwintering larvae, respectively. There was no difference in sawfly survival in dryland or irrigated wheat fields. As ubiquitous soil microorganisms and plant pathogens, Fusarium spp. impact wheat stem sawfly populations in the field each year.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/sun/SunZ0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying the viscoelastic properties of treated and untreated Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms using a rheological creep analysis</field><field name="creator">Sutton, Michael Philip</field><field name="description">Microbial biofilms are quite difficult to kill and control, and present many problems to industry and medicine. The ability to alter the mechanical properties of biofilms could aid in the control of biofilm. The goal of this research project was to develop techniques for measuring the mechanical properties of biofilms so that the effects of chemical treatments could be assessed. Constitutive material models were developed and applied to assist in this effort to quantify the effects. Biofilms are viscoelastic in nature, therefore, rheological testing techniques were utilized for this research. Creep testing was performed on a parallel plate rheometer to determine biofilm mechanical properties. The rheometer is a mechanical device that can accurately measure and apply shear stress and strain on viscoelastic samples. The Burger material model closely approximated material behavior of most chemical treatments. This model was used for determining constitutive properties. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FRD1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis colony biofilms were used for testing. Several treatment methods were used to investigate their effect on biofilm mechanical properties. As a source of different cations, solutions of NaCl, FeCl3, AlCl3, MgCl2, CaCl2, FeCl2 were used for testing. Multivalent cation treatments stiffened the FRD1 biofilm, but weakened the S. epidermidis. Urea treatments weakened both biofilm species. Glutaraldehyde treatments weakened the FRD1 biofilm, but had little effect on the S. epidermidis. Several treatments - EDTA, Barquat, chlorine, antibiotics (rifampin, and ciprofloxacin) - weakened biofilms of both species. The effect of the same chemical treatment between the two species of biofilm sometimes had nearly opposite effects on the biofilms mechanical properties. This research illustrated that it is possible to alter the mechanical properties of biofilm through chemical addition. Further, there are significant differences between the ways that the material properties of biofilms of different species of bacteria will be affected by a chemical treatment. Finally, it was observed that the 4-parameter Burger model for constitutive mechanical properties of biofilms fit the vast majority of the collected data, so that this model proves useful in comparing properties of biofilms grown or treated under various conditions.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/sutton/SuttonM0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biostimulatory effect of bulls on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and ovarian axes and on temporal aspects of resumption of ovarian cycling activity in primiparous, postpartum, anestrous, suckled, beef cows</field><field name="creator">Tauck, Shaun Austin</field><field name="description">Exposing cows to bulls or excretory products of bulls stimulates resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, suckled, anestrous cows. This biostimulatory effect may be mediated by pheromones produced by bulls that stimulate physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) and/or -adrenal (HPA) axes of cows. In Experiment 1, the hypothesis tested was that the biostimulatory effect of bulls is associated with adrenal regulation and/or function in anestrous cows. The biostimulatory effect of bulls was associated with mean concentrations of cortisol in postpartum cows. Experiment 2 was designed to determine if acute (5-h daily) bull exposure alters characteristics of patterns of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations in postpartum, anestrous cows. Cows exposed acutely to bulls exhibited fewer pulses of cortisol and more frequent pulses of LH than cows exposed to steers. However, it was not known if these changes were related to resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, anestrous cows. Experiment 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that patterns of cortisol concentrations are altered by continuous, 24-h daily, bull exposure, before and after resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, anestrous cows. Continuous bull exposure decreased cortisol pulse frequency before cows resumed ovarian cycling activity. Experiment 4 tested the hypothesis that the overall shape of patterns of cortisol and/or LH concentrations may differ between cows exposed acutely to bulls or steers in Experiment 2. Cows exposed acutely to bulls had more uneven patterns of LH concentrations than cows exposed to steers and as patterns of cortisol concentrations became smoother, patterns of LH become more uneven in cows exposed acutely to bulls. In Experiment 5, the hypothesis tested was that interval to resumption of ovarian cycling activity may depend upon duration of daily bull exposure. Cows resumed ovarian cycling activity sooner as duration of daily bull exposure increased. In conclusion, as duration of daily bull exposure increases, the biostimulatory effect of bulls alters activity of the HPA axis and this change may facilitate or support the function of the HPO axis and accelerate resumption of ovarian cycling activity in primiparous, postpartum, suckled, anestrous cows.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/tauckTauckS1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Covered</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Caleb Josiah</field><field name="description">My investigation of painting has led to creating abstractions that refer to internal and external anatomical forms.

This usually involves the development of a hydraulic model. For the hydraulic model to be of use it must be calibrated using collected field data. Few established guidelines exist for utilities to perform such data collection and calibration. There are many different types of data that can be collected using many different methods. There are also various model calibration methods that can be used. This study sought to develop an optimized sampling plan and calibration method for a small utility that defines the best practice for data type, location, quantity, and collection conditions. A large quantity of many data types were collected at various locations in the system. Different methods were used to calibrate the model with various data sets and the model accuracy was evaluated using a second independent data set. The effect of model input parameter accuracy and pipe grouping during calibration on overall accuracy was also investigated. Data type, location, quantity, and collection conditions had an impact on calibration accuracy. High headloss data from fire flow tests provided better calibrations than low loss data from static pressures. Carefully selected test locations resulted in more efficient calibration than evenly distributed test locations. There was found to be a point of diminishing returns when investigating the amount of data used in calibration versus calibration accuracy. Uncalibrated model input parameters such as elevations and pump characteristics also had a significant impact on model calibration accuracy.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/trasky/TraskyT0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personal Narratives</field><field name="creator">Turbuck, Christopher James</field><field name="description">This body of work is comprised of autobiographical narratives from my everyday experiences.

I adopt many conventions from comic books. They allow me to freely incorporate text and image into the same pictorial space. Additionally, the comic book form possesses associations with \"low art\" that are valuable to my work.

I use the formal devices of comic books to raise the viewer/reader\'s expectations for a lighthearted, juvenile form of entertainment. However, once the viewer/reader examines the work more closely, I give them something else: a new way of looking at regular life that reveals the profound in the ordinary; a chance to identify with my awkward, deeply personal experiences; a quiet note of encouragement that none of us is truly alone.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/turbuck/TurbuckC0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' beliefs regarding effective teaching strategies for American Indian students in mathematics</field><field name="creator">Vallines Mira, Raquel</field><field name="description">Extensive research has been conducted on teaching strategies that are effective for American Indians in mathematics. Despite the variety of cultural, linguistic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors influencing student learning within and among American Indian communities, common characteristics of learning styles and effective teaching practices have been identified. Though the wording in each definition varies, research based on a variety of theoretical frameworks and using a variety of methodologies and instruments suggests that among American Indian students, there is a tendency to learn better when the following three strategies are used: contextualization, modeling and demonstration, and joint productive activity. Despite the general agreement in education research that the beliefs that teachers hold about mathematics teaching and learning greatly impact their instructional decisions in the classroom, few, if any, of those studies have examined teachers' beliefs regarding effective strategies for American Indians in mathematics. The main purpose of this study was to add the voices of four teachers to the research community conversation about effective teaching strategies for American Indians in mathematics. Two elementary and two high school teachers from two schools in Montana were selected for this study for their experience with and commitment to the mathematics education of American Indian students. Two are American Indians and two are White. Using a combination of classroom observations and a modification of videoclip interviews, the beliefs of the four teachers were identified with particular focus on the three teaching strategies mentioned above. The study shows that teachers' definitions of research-based strategies often differ from those intended by the research. Teachers' views about these strategies seemed to be idiosyncratic to individual teachers and appeared to be shaped by multiple lenses. In this study, some of those lenses emerged including, among others, school structures and teachers' cultural backgrounds. In light of the results of the study, future efforts for constructive bi-directional communication between the research community and practitioners are recommended.</field><field name="date">2008-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/vallines_mira/Vallines_MiraR0808.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rebirth of Identity</field><field name="creator">Vandergrift, Raluca M.</field><field name="description">The reality of communism was not and is not the efficient equality for all described by Karl Marx. Communism was distorted by human nature to create a powerful and oppressive tyranny by which many suffered in Eastern Europe. Architecture was and remains one of the primary ways to display power. It can oppress the masses by raising fear and suspicion from the governing as well as from the governed. In the mid 60's Romania gained autonomy from Russia and began to practice its own form of communism. The power of propaganda remained, creative individualism perished, and the commune prevailed. The private domicile was assigned to the individual based on the number of family members. But in reality the quality of one's home was purely based on ties to the communist party. Most people had to give up old family homes and move in "bloc" system apartment buildings. These structures were built on a grid with the efficiency of a machine. Expanded within the grid were the cells of private life. Effort was not given to comfort or individuality. Although these structures have a resemblance to the projects of New York there is a certain nostalgia for these concrete neighborhoods. They represent a time when people were drawn together against the greater evil and a time when children took first steps. It was also a time of invisible resources such as food and heat, yet Bucharest would be a different city without these neighborhoods. The banishment of individuality in public and private life created a social change in Romanian culture. Whether it became an underground affair to express individuality, spirituality, homosexuality or whether its suppression abolished certain traits in the Romanian people is of great interest to me. I would like to focus on one neighborhood in Bucharest, Romania which is comprised of the communist style apartment buildings in order to figure out what course of action would be most suitable for bringing back the sense of pride and identity in peoples' living spaces. Should the buildings be renovated, destroyed or would a community center be more effective?</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/vandergrift/VandergriftR1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving beyond broadcast and traditional pedagogy:  making a children\'s documentary for the new media landscape</field><field name="creator">Walker, Hannah Smith</field><field name="description">This thesis is a synthesis between the use of new media in the children\'s documentary, Why don\'t we ride zebras?, the use of technology in both formal and informal education, and the convergence of user-malleable media ideal for education-based documentaries.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/walker/WalkerH1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape and place-identity in a Great Plains Reservation community:  a historical geography of Poplar, Montana</field><field name="creator">Warren, Scott Daniel</field><field name="description">This study constructs a historical-geographical narrative of Poplar, Montana and explores residents' place-identity in the context of economic restructuring. Located on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana, Poplar offers an ideal setting to better understand how economic restructuring affects the lives of residents in northern Plains reservation communities. Loss of businesses, consolidation of services, and general economic restructuring continue to challenge communities on the Great Plains. For Great Plains Indian reservations, however, these problems are compounded by additional variables such as persistently high poverty rates, a dynamic relationship with the federal government, and increasing populations. Archival research, landscape analysis, and interview data are all used to better understand the influence of economic restructuring in shaping Poplar.

The fragmentation of the television market place with the growth of cable television has pushed science documentaries into a headlong pursuit for higher viewer ratings in a medium dominated by works of fiction. In response to this, science documentary has steadily been pushed to alter the techniques it uses, and adapt its content to become more dramatic. Varying market pressures have led to the rise of two dominant methods of dramatization; narrative imposition and visual spectacle (typically CGI). However, in addition to making science shows more dramatic these two techniques have acted to create a hybridized format, blending subjective speculation with traditional expositional documentary techniques. The result of such hybridization has been to blur the lines between fact and fiction and to allow for the creation of dubious subjunctive documentaries, and almost entirely fictive narrative documentaries. This has acted to uphold the cultural practice of misinterpreting science in order to support fantasy and fiction, and has led to a rise in pseudoscience, which could be potentially very damaging to society. The growth in the public misinterpretation of science could leave our societies woefully unprepared to make informed decisions about the future. To avoid this, I suggest that we find ways to adapt science for television that are more accurate in showing the true nature of science. Instead of bending science to conform to preconceived, linear dramatic narratives, I suggest we look at alternative narratives such as those seen in discursive \'essay\' films. And, instead of stretching spectacle and visualization so far as to create fantastical dramatic fictional worlds, I believe we should focus on creating shows that use metaphor and analogy to help us visualize the real, hidden nature of science. By utilizing scientists as guides and peers rather than as heroes and elitists, by choosing discourse over teleology, and by incorporating visually rich metaphors and analogies into science shows, we can render the strange and unfamiliar understandable and engaging.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/watkins/WatkinsE1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Satellite monitoring of cropland-related carbon sequestration practices in North Central Montana</field><field name="creator">Watts, Jennifer Dawn</field><field name="description">This study used an object-oriented approach in conjunction with the Random Forest algorithm to classify agricultural practices set forth in carbon contract agreements associated with the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), including tillage (till or no-till (NT)), conservation reserve (CR), and crop intensity. The object-oriented approach allowed for per-field classifications and the incorporation of contextual elements in addition to spectral features. Random Forest is an advanced classification method that avoids data over-fitting and incorporates an internal classification accuracy assessment. Landsat satellite imagery was chosen for its continuous coverage, cost effectiveness, and image accessibility. Classification (2007) results included producer\'s accuracies of 91% for NT and 31% for tillage when applying Random Forest to image-objects generated from a May Landsat image. Low classification accuracies likely were attributed to the misclassification of conservation-based tillage practices as NT. Crop and CR lands resulted in producer\'s accuracies of 100% and 90%, respectively. Crop and fallow producer\'s accuracies were 95% and 82% in the 2007 classification; misclassification within the fallow class was attributed to pixel-mixing problems in areas of narrow (&gt;100 m) strip management. A between-date normalized difference vegetation index approach was successfully used to detect areas \"changed\" in vegetation status between the 2007 and prior image dates; classified \"changed\" objects were then merged with \"unchanged\" objects to produce final classification maps of crop versus fallow. Resulting statistics showed that 22% of lands classified as CR had occurred outside of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Field survey results were applied for tillage analysis because of low image classification rates and indicated that 56% of the evaluated region was under NT in 2007, with 44% practicing some form of tillage. Crop intensity estimates indicated that only 5% was under continuous cropping. These observations show the potential for the increased NT and continuous cropping. The application of carbon sequestration estimates to the land use data predict that approximately 59,497 t C yr&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; might be sequestered through the universal adoption of NT and a 1.0 rotation (continuous cropping). Financial incentives through carbon credit programs might motivate land managers to make these management changes and to maintain CR lands.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/watts/WattsJ1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying perceptions of health promotion barriers and benefits in individuals at risk for coronary heart disease</field><field name="creator">Weston, Nicolett Marie</field><field name="description">Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the single largest cause of death in the U.S., and is also the leading cause of death in Montana. In addition, the estimated direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease in the U.S. for 2007 were $431.8 billion. Anticipated barriers to health promotion behavior have been shown to affect intentions to engage in and execute the behaviors. Exploring individual\'s perception of the benefits of health promotion behaviors is equally important when addressing barriers to making lifestyle changes. CHD is strongly associated with modifiable risk factors including physical inactivity, poor diet, and tobacco use. Although CHD risk factors have been studied extensively, few studies have assessed individuals\' combined perceptions of barriers and benefits as reasons for non-adherence to recommended health promotion behaviors related to CHD risk and most of these studies included only women. The purpose of this research study was to examine perceived barriers and benefits to CHD risk modification in men and women living in a rural western state. Two survey tools were used to collect the data from a convenience sample of persons seen in the cardiac care areas at a local hospital in a rural western state. The findings of this study provided important information about the perceived barriers and benefits to CHD risk modification of persons previously diagnosed or at risk for CHD. Results from this study imply that in order to develop effective interventions, it is important to understand the individual and his or her unique characteristics including gender, socioeconomic status, and education level in relation to his or her perceived barriers and benefits to health promotion. Nurse practitioners and other primary care providers can incorporate this knowledge into future strategies to reduce or eliminate barriers, increase perceived benefits, and promote health promotion behaviors in individuals who are at risk for developing CHD. Advocating for health promotion behavior adoption and CHD risk modification offer a very important and practical tool for providers to help individuals address and lower risk factors as well as prevent CHD and treat individuals with established CHD.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/weston/WestonN0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishment of ureolytic biofilms and their influence on the permeability of pulse-flow porous media column systems</field><field name="creator">Wheeler, Laura Allison</field><field name="description">As the population of the world has increased, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions have increased as well. One possible way to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere is through the geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide. During geologic sequestration, supercritical carbon dioxide is injected into different types of underground formations. Inherent cracks in these formations may lead to the upward leakage of CO2, and a controllable engineered strategy is needed to reduce this potential leakage. Currently, biomineralization has been used in many different environmental applications but not for the sequestration of carbon dioxide. The goal of this research is to establish biofilm communities of ureolytic bacteria that promote CaCO3 precipitation in a pulse-flow porous media column system with the intent of reducing the porosity and permeability of the porous media. Pulse-flow column systems were inoculated with different species of ureolytic bacteria: S. pasteurii, B. sphaericus #21776, or B. sphaericus #21787. The bacteria were allowed to grow in the column for five days before a calcium-containing medium was introduced. Flow rate, pH, ammonium concentration, calcium concentration, culturable bacteria, and protein concentration were monitored over the course of the entire experiments. It was shown that all ureolytic species were capable of growing, utilizing urea, and creating an environment that facilitated calcium carbonate precipitation in 1mm diameter glass bead packed columns at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. To better understand the effect of pore space on biomineralization columns packed with 0.1 mm diameter glass beads were constructed and inoculated with S. pasteurii. Within days of calcium introduction, the permeability of the columns was reduced to the point where no more fluid would drain from the column. These results indicate that the ureolytic bacteria are capable of surviving, facilitating calcium carbonate precipitation, and reducing the permeability of the pulse-flow porous media column system. While further study is needed, the precipitation of calcium carbonate through ureolysis may offer a controllable engineered strategy to reduce the permeability of underground formations used for geologic sequestration.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/wheeler/WheelerL1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A community in the desert</field><field name="creator">Winchester, Sean Brady</field><field name="description">Changing paradigms in society's general understanding of reality have revealed general deficiencies in contemporary architecture, the primary evidence of the unique human relationship with reality. This thesis seeks to understand the nature of perceived architectural poverty and works toward a general approach for a more human, more timely, more appropriate architecture in synch with new, lost, ignored and rejected ideas. Architecture is qualified not as merely buildings, but as a system of relationships between objective and uniquely human subjective aspects of reality. Architecture is further refined to a definition as the relationships between the physical world, subjective experience, abstract knowledge and truth. The relationships inherent in this definition are used to analyze significant spheres of architectural context in order to determine which are most deterministic to architecture as the relationships defined. In order to test the application of the ideas put forth, a project is proposed as a testing grounds. &amp;Icirc;&#8221;City is a proposed community project sited in Nevada, 15 miles east of Reno, centered around a large new manufacturing, warehousing and distribution development: Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. &amp;Icirc;&#8221;City is conceived as a systems-analysis-become-architecture based on the previous theoretical work.

In this dissertation, their potential for quantum computing applications is explored. In one quantum computing scheme, information is stored in nuclear spin states and this information is then processed by using optical pulses through the coupling of these nuclear spin states to a common electronic level. To implement this scheme, nuclear spin states and coupling of these nuclear spin states to a common electronic level is required. Preliminary work in rare-earth materials like Pr3+ and Eu3+ has shown promising results regarding their suitability for quantum computing applications. One particular problem with these materials is that their transition wavelengths are only accessible with dye lasers. These lasers are inherently unstable, and currently few available systems exhibit the stability required for quantum computing applications. An alternative choice was to investigate other rare-earth ions like thulium. Thulium has a transition wavelength that can be accessed with diode lasers, which are commercially available, easy to stabilize, and compact. This dissertation is based on our investigations of Tm3+:YAG for quantum computing applications. Investigations involved a detailed characterization of the material. Nuclear spin states, in Tm3+:YAG, were obtained by applying an external magnetic field to the sample. First, interaction of an external magnetic field with the thulium ions at various sites in the crystal was analyzed. This analysis was used to measure the magnetic anisotropy in the material. These results show that it is possible, with the suitable choice of the magnetic orientation and the site in the crystal, to build a working 3-level quantum system. In the demonstration of single qubit operations in Tm3+:YAG, we first theoretically studied the effect of Gaussian spatial beam on the single qubit operations. Later on, we experimentally prepared a single isolated ensemble of ions in the inhomogeneously broadened absorption profile of the medium. This single isolated ensemble of ions was used as a test-bed to implement the single qubit operations. We also isolated two ensembles of ions in the inhomogeneous absorption profile of the medium. The interaction between these two isolated ensembles of ions was also studied.</field><field name="date">2008-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2008/zafarullah/ZafarullahI0508.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of political factors on the allocation of disaster relief payments</field><field name="creator">Zhorayev, Olzhas Zhumadillayevich</field><field name="description">There are different models predicting a connection between political variables and the allocation of federal spending.

But little information is available regarding reseeding to spring wheat. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of injury whereby it is more profitable to reseed to spring rather than leave the reduced stand of winter wheat. Eighteen treatments were used to simulate different levels of winter injury and methods of termination of the winter wheat before reseeding. Soil water and nitrogen use by the winter wheat before termination was also determined. Mechanical and chemical termination of 60%, 40% and 20% stands of winter wheat were replanted to spring wheat. An early and late reseeding was also imposed. A 20% stand of winter wheat out yielded the early seeded spring wheat check in all environments.

The political environments of NCLB and community technology expectations created a unique context for the superintendent of the case study. Montana superintendents are learning to integrate technology into their roles to improve schools and increasing student growth. Approaches a Montana superintendent with a "high reputation" for technology implemented into his roles to improve schools and increase student achievement are documented in the study. Reasons for implementing the technological approaches answered research questions focusing on assumptions held in mental models. Case study research with a mental model theoretical framework was used to describe technological approaches the superintendent integrated into his roles. Interviews, observations, field notes, and artifacts provided data required to describe the technological approaches. Assumptions clustered together provided the insight to understand technology approaches from emerging themes. Assumptions were drawn from themes and checked with the superintendent. The superintendent managed his district resources in essentially a paperless office. Student records were managed with technology in his schools. Internet connections made communication instant. The assumptions of efficiency drove decisions to implement managerial technology approaches. The superintendent's belief that students preferred learning with technology indicated a student-centered instructional leadership style. The superintendent believed tapping into students' interest in technology was a way to motivate them. The superintendent believed that alignment of student learning preferences with instruction was important. To integrate technology into instruction required professional development in order to make teachers comfortable infusing technology into instruction to deliver content, technological assessment approaches, and continuous visibility to sustain political support. The assumptions held by the superintendent that affected the superintendent's approaches to integrate technology through his roles were 1) leadership's belief that student learning preferences with technology were important, 2) leadership belief that technological learning and instruction should be aligned, 3) leadership's belief that teachers needed professional development to become comfortable with technology, 4) leadership's belief that alternative technological assessment data were superior to yearly AYP results, and 5) leadership's skills in fostering supportive relationships created a political shared will.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/anderson/AndersonA0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing structure of the determinants of cattle prices in the United States: an emperical study</field><field name="creator">Arthun, Cole Derril</field><field name="description">This study utilizes a new quarterly data set for the United States cattle markets spanning from 1971-2008 to estimate dynamic price models in three vertically related cattle markets: the models for boxed beef cutouts, slaughter cattle, and feeder cattle. Structural tests are then utilized to test whether the occurrence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in 2003 and the introduction and widespread use of the Atkins diet between 1991 and 2005 lead to structural changes in the determinants of prices in each of the three markets. The results suggest BSE did not cause structural change within any market level, and BSE and Atkins diet events caused structural change within the boxed beef cutout values level. An important contribution of this study is the examination of structural change, suggesting that the market events lead to little or no structural change within the market levels.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/arthun/ArthunC0809.cole.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in deciduous woody vegetation, implications of increased willow (Salix spp.) growth for bird species diversity, and willow species composition in and around Yellowstone National Park's Northern range</field><field name="creator">Baril, Lisa Marie</field><field name="description">Deciduous woody vegetation (DWV) in Yellowstone's northern range is a rare, but important habitat type. Including willow, alder, aspen, and cottonwood, DWV was limited in height and areal extent since the early 1900s. Since the mid-1990s; however, DWV has increased in height and areal extent in some locations. Previous studies regarding DWV change have focused on quantifying change in vegetation growth in areas of limited extent and none have quantified increased DWV growth at the scale of the landscape. Furthermore, no studies have evaluated the implications for increased growth of DWV for wildlife in the region or how DWV species themselves may influence rates of growth. In this thesis I evaluate change in DWV within wetland and riparian areas using aerial photographs from 1991 and 2006. I also investigate how an increase in willow, the dominant component of DWV in the region, has likely influenced bird diversity. Finally, since willow species vary with respect to genetic limitations on growth and reproduction that in turn may influence observed patterns of growth; I examine willow species composition across the northern range. Results of the air photo interpretation revealed a 170% increase in DWV. Most plots that increased did so by recruitment rather than densification; however, DWV was difficult to detect below 100 cm indicating that the number of plots increasing by recruitment may have been overestimated. Bird community variables were examined in three willow growth conditions: height suppressed, recently released, and previously tall (tall prior to observed increase in growth). I found that willow structure generally increased in complexity from structurally simple height suppressed willows to structurally complex previously tall willows and that this allowed for greater bird richness, abundance, diversity, and the abundance of several willow dependent bird species. I also found that willow species composition was similar and diverse between the released and previously tall condition, but that the suppressed condition was dominated by a singe species. I conclude that increased DWV has allowed for greater bird diversity in the northern range and that increased willow growth in the suppressed condition may be influenced by species composition there.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/baril/BarilL1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A description of sleep patterns and sleep hygiene practices for adults in cardiac rehabilitation programs in Southern Montana</field><field name="creator">Barker, Tina Marie</field><field name="description">Despite the importance of coronary heart disease (CHD) as a major health problem and cardiac rehabilitation as a means of secondary prevention, no previous studies have been found which describe sleep patterns and sleep hygiene practices in this population. Sleep is essential for mental and physical well being and good sleep hygiene practices promote high quality sleep. Poor sleep quality can increase the risk of a myocardial infarction in persons with CHD. The purpose of this descriptive study was to describe sleep patterns and practices of adults diagnosed with CHD and participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program. Two survey tools, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Sleep Hygiene Index, were used to collect data on a convenience sample of 31 adults participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs located in southern Montana. The questionnaires were returned with a response rate of 69.3%. Study results indicate poor sleep quality in this sample population which was primarily due to poor sleep efficiency and sleep disturbance. Sleep hygiene practices of this sample were relatively good, with only a few areas of deficiencies observed. The findings from this study provide a basis for future research. Future research needs to approach the cardiac rehabilitation population on a larger scale and determine if specific sleep hygiene practices correlate with poor sleep quality. Nurse practitioners and other providers can incorporate this knowledge into interventions to promote sleep and sleep hygiene practices.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/barker/BarkerT0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon dioxide sequestration underground laser based detection system</field><field name="creator">Barr, Jamie Lynn</field><field name="description">Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a known greenhouse gas. Due to the burning of fossil fuels by industrial and power plants the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 has been rising over the past 50 years. Carbon capture and sequestration provides a method to prevent CO 2 from being emitted into the atmosphere. Successful carbon sequestration will require the development of many pieces of technology including development of monitoring tools and techniques. An underground laser based monitoring system was built and tested at Montana State University (MSU) to measure sub-surface CO 2 concentrations at a sequestration site. The instrument uses differential absorption spectroscopy by temperature tuning a distributed feedback diode laser over several CO 2 absorption features located at 2.004 microns. The instrument utilizes photonic bandgap fibers for sub-surface spectroscopy CO 2 concentration measurements. The instrument was tested at a controlled release facility located on the MSU campus. The field and CO 2 release are managed by the Zero Emissions Research and Technology group at MSU. Three CO 2 injection tests were done over the coarse of two summers to simulate a fault or fracture line at a sequestration site. Results from all three tests are presented showing that the underground differential absorption instrument could be used to monitor sequestration sites.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/barr/BarrJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secular spiritual nature films: their use, misuse, and potential promise as roving biospheres</field><field name="creator">Beck, Jefferson Andrews</field><field name="description">The central purpose of poetic techniques in nature films remains under-analyzed and the realm of spiritual motivations in filmic techniques under-explored.

This consciousness is readily viewable from the perspective of current environmental crisis. As such, it is proposed that an investigation into the alienated consciousness might reveal both why we dominate and destroy our environment and ourselves, as well as how we might resolve alienation and, by extension, begin to live harmoniously within our surroundings and neighbors on earth. Two texts, Crime and Punishment and Desolation Angels, by Fyodor Dostoevsky and Jack Kerouac, respectively, are exemplary of the type of human alienation discussed in this thesis: that is, the alienation that arises from our perceived existence as neither gods (stewardship) nor animals (beasts). This anomalous state is further revealed through the inclusion of Emmanuel Levinas' Totality and Infinity, which condemns our totalistic trajectory as reinforcing alienation by obstructing the trajectory of infinity, or the proper course of humanity marked by ethics of interconnectivity and diversity. Also included is Mikhail Bakhtin's Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics, which helps reveal how ethics of interconnectivity and diversity are arranged in Dostoevsky's work. By reading these texts together, we reveal that alienation is a unique derivative of particular socio-cultural spaces, and that the modernizing human trajectory since the burgeoning of capitalism in 1860s Russia to postwar America has only served to reinforce alienation, thus linking perverse destruction to exploitative societies as marked by the pursuit of material gain. We therefore conclude that keen attention must be paid to the human ego as well as dedication to sustainability through the reduction of excess if we wish to resolve alienation and the domination and exhaustion of resources and diversity that ensues.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/beideman/BeidemanC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiber optic vines on the third wall: cultivating natural media in the digital age</field><field name="creator">Bendick, Eric Louis</field><field name="description">Twenty-thousand years ago, the earliest known depictions of natural forms were inscribed by primitive man onto the surface of the "third wall" . . . be it cave, grotto, overhang, or alcove. Today the myriad representations of our natural world, along with the expanding cosmic narratives of 'natural history' that animate and describe such characters within an ornate epistemological framework (part-science: evolution, thermodynamics, ecology, and part-social criticism: environmental justice, sustainability, conservation) proliferate in ever-increasing mobile permutations; not only in our textbooks and living rooms, but also in our cars, on billboards, Jumbotrons, laptops, cell phones, and portable media players. Throughout history, changes in representational 'mode' (across and through new technical mediums) have ushered in significant narrative metamorphoses, formal innovations, and accompanied revolutionary transitions in symbolic language. The focus of this paper is to assess the implications of recent technological shifts, especially those characterized by the widespread contemporary adoption of digital technologies and the emergence of vast, interconnected networks of computing power, on the representation, production, and distribution of 'natural world' (both science and social) new media content. Through a detailed survey of popular case-studies, analytical research, and data trends, this paper will analyze new media models both from within and without as they relate to digital publishing, non-linear content creation, social networking, and the increasingly permeable interface between consumer and producer in our contemporary mediascape. Finally, this paper applies formative research to prescribe a more general use of 'best practices' in new technology which may facilitate a more progressive and participatory moment in post-industrial 'natural world' media-making, in concert with peers and fans, corporations and collectives, and open to interpretation, cross-pollination, and synergistic hybridity. It is no exaggeration to remark that this technological transformation will forever change the way we learn, evaluate, and participate in a global dialogue whose subject is none other than the globe itself. As our ancestors surely harnessed the power of the 'third wall' to communicate in both personal and broad strokes, so this essay seeks to re-imagine the 'digital third wall' as a place of increasing ubiquity, intimacy, contention, and epistemological power throughout the evolving realms of scientific and social natural representation.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/bendick/BendickE0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compact, mid-infared laser source for remote sensing of gas effluents</field><field name="creator">Berg, Trenton Jeffery</field><field name="description">Remote sensing of gas effluents in the mid-IR wavelength region from 2 microns to 5 microns is preferred due to strong molecular absorption features (10 to 100 times stronger than in the near-IR) and high-transparency atmospheric windows. Currently, long-range mid-IR remote sensing is inhibited by the lack of suitable laser sources. As a result, frequency conversion in nonlinear optical materials has emerged as a powerful method to produce high-power, tunable, mid-IR light. However, compact, high-power narrowband conversion systems suitable for long-range mid-IR spectroscopy are not commercially available. This thesis describes the development of a high-power, narrowband, tunable, compact, mid-IR laser source for long-range remote sensing of gas effluents. Frequency conversion into the mid-IR is achieved by use of a high-peak-power, compact pump laser and optical parametric generation (OPG) in periodically poled nonlinear crystals. This mid-IR laser system was designed and developed for remote sensing at ranges up to and exceeding 100 m in a compact form factor. Such a laser will fill the current scientific need for a hand-held mid-IR laser source capable of long-range mid-IR spectroscopy. Based on theoretical models and experimental demonstrations a compact mid-IR laser source was developed that emits &gt; 1 mJ broadband pulses in the mid-IR. To narrow the linewidth of the broadband OPG output, optical parametric amplification was demonstrated through seeding of the OPG process with a narrowband, continuous-wave, distributed feedback (DFB) laser. Seeding efficiencies exceeding 35% were demonstrated for 1 mJ of output energy, and efficiencies exceeding 65% were demonstrated at lower energies when the pump beam was spatially filtered. The linewidth of the narrowed mid- IR output was inferred to be &lt; 350 MHz based upon heterodyne measurements conducted at the signal wavelength in the near-IR. This linewidth is well within the FWHM bandwidth of typical mid-IR atmospherically broadened molecular absorption features. The demonstrated mid-IR energies and laser linewidths are predicted to be sufficient for detection of low concentration gas effluents (&lt; 1 ppm) at ranges exceeding 100 m. The developed mid-IR laser source was used to successfully demonstrate differential detection of carbon dioxide (CO 2).</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/berg/BergT1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political economy of prescribed fires: a land agency's decision to burn</field><field name="creator">Berreth, Mark Alan</field><field name="description">National land agencies ignite hundreds of prescribed fires every year throughout the Rocky Mountain West. When a national land agency proposes a prescribed fire they must by statute take public opinion into account before igniting the burn. The public interest of a prescribed fire may be to decrease the acreage of the burn in order to save animal habitat or possibly to stop a burn entirely. A theoretical model where a land agency maximizes a net social expected benefit was used to develop comparative static results in the empirical analysis. Using county Sierra Club membership as a proxy for protests, this thesis analyzes acreage differences and timing differences of prescribed fires. First, a probit model is used to evaluate the probability of a wildland urban interface prescribed fire. The regression results present a higher probability of wildland urban interface prescribed fires at the median of county Sierra Club membership as a percent of county population, ceteris paribus. County Sierra Club membership as a percent of county population was not statistically significant in explaining proportion acreage changes from proposed to actual acres burnt. Timing differences, on the other hand, were found to increase as county Sierra Club membership as a percent of county population increased, ceteris paribus. The empirical results imply that land agencies treat their prescribed fires that are in the wildland urban interface the same. There are also timing differences that can be explained through pressure from group interest in land agency policies.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/berreth/BerrethM1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distress in nurses following patient death: a local response to the need for debriefing</field><field name="creator">Bickham, Melanie Ann</field><field name="description">The purpose of this clinical project was to determine if nurses in an acute care setting would report a need for debriefing following a patient death. The review of current literature revealed mixed results regarding the effectiveness of debriefing as an intervention. Literature shows that emotional expression is perceived as cathartic by nurses and is viewed as a positive coping mechanism. However, randomized controlled trials of debriefing models did not demonstrate that participation in debriefing prevented distress symptoms. A survey was created to assess nurses' views regarding debriefing following a patient's death. Surveys were placed in mailboxes of Registered Nurses and Licensed Practical Nurses in a 220 bed hospital in Montana. There were 55 respondents. Demographically, the average participant in the survey was 38 years of age, held a bachelors degree, had been a nurse for 9 years, worked in a critical care unit, and had experienced approximately 15 patient deaths over their career. The majority of nurses surveyed felt that an information-sharing and event processing session among peers (debriefing) would be helpful in coping with their emotions after a patient's death. Thirty of those surveyed reported they would be very likely to participate or would definitely participate in a debriefing session if it were available. The overwhelming majority (n=52, 94.3%) reported experiencing one symptom of distress after a patient death. Comments written on the surveys were grouped into themes. These themes included catharsis/sharing, positive coping, past experiences with debriefing, prevention of death, perceived need for formal debriefing, no perceived need for formal debriefing, emotional distancing, and debriefing only for special circumstances. Surveys revealed that the majority of nurses surveyed felt that debriefing sessions would be helpful in processing their emotions following a patient death. The author wrote a nursing policy regarding the use of debriefing in a hospital setting for nurses following a patient death and made this available to the organization surveyed.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/bickham/BickhamM0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Training responses of two-year-old Quarter horses fed rapidly fermentable carbohydrates</field><field name="creator">Black, Wade Raymond</field><field name="description">Two replicated experiments (Exp. 1: May 14 to June 8; Exp.2: June 25 to July 20) evaluated effects of feeding grain to 2-yr-old Quarter horses on behavior and physiological parameters during early stages of training. In each experiment, 6 different horses were allotted by sex and weight to 2 diets; hay only or hay plus 2.3 kg/d grain. Horses were group-housed with ad libitum access to grass/alfalfa hay and water, and were individually fed 1.15 kg grain or 40 g salt (placebo) at 0800 and 1600 for 7 d prior to and during training. The trainer was blind to diet assignments. Horses were trained 5 d/wk for 3 wk and scored (1 to 5) by the trainer daily on obedience (willingness to ride with a loose rein and little leg pressure), life (willingness to move at any desired speed), and direction (suppleness in the poll and loin), while an observer scored fearfulness. A heart monitor recorded minimum, maximum, and mean heart rate daily during training. Categorical data were transformed by subtracting the daily median as each horse's score was relative to the other horses on that day. Data were analyzed as repeated measures (Proc Mixed of SAS) with horse as the experimental unit. In Exp. 1 grain did not affect (P = 0.83) obedience, while horses fed grain in Exp. 2 were less obedient during training (P = 0.02) than those not receiving grain. Horses fed grain showed greater (P = 0.05) fearfulness than horses fed hay alone. Life:direction (ideal is 1.0, &gt; 1.0 indicates high self-preservation) was higher (P = 0.04) in horses fed grain than in those fed hay alone (1.29 vs. 1.08, respectively). Maximum heart rate was not affected (P = 0.21) by grain, while mean heart rate was higher (P = 0.03) for horses fed grain than hay alone (126 vs. 119 beats/min, respectively). Horses fed grain during training exhibited more self-preservation behavior, increased mean heart rate, and an unbalanced life to direction ratio, which could inhibit training effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/black/BlackW0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the relationship between preservice teachers' epistemological beliefs and conceptions of teacher identity within the boundaries of teacher education discourse communities</field><field name="creator">Blair, Jennifer Johnson</field><field name="description">A teacher's epistemological beliefs define the boundaries of his or her worldview and conceptualization of teacher identity. It is, therefore, essential that teacher educators support the development of sophisticated epistemological beliefs among preservice teachers. Prior studies have suggested that epistemic development may be hindered by emphasis placed on the performance of a socially constructed normative teacher identity within teacher preparation programs. This phenomenological study, which examines the relationship between preservice teachers' epistemological beliefs and their beliefs regarding normative teacher identity at different points in their teacher education program, aims to provide insight into how teacher preparation programs may better support the development of more sophisticated epistemological beliefs among preservice teachers. Data was collected from 40 preservice teachers at Montana State University using a survey instrument created for this study and interpreted through a process of discourse analysis. The individual preservice teachers studied expressed epistemological beliefs and conceptions of teacher identity that were contradictory without ever acknowledging or attempting to explain these contradictions. This suggests that the participants may not have actually developed their own beliefs through a process of consideration or inquiry, but instead have received them during their time in the teacher preparation program. The results of this study suggest that interventions focused on reflection upon theory and practice will continue to be ineffective as long as the preservice teachers continue to reflect upon these ideas through the lens of undeveloped epistemological beliefs situated within the context of a received teacher identity.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/blair/BlairJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pro-active adaptation: improving infrastructure</field><field name="creator">Brandt, Andrew MacMillan</field><field name="description">Life on this planet adapts reactively through necessity; as environmental context changes, so do the inhabitants.

The bacterial cells are surrounded by protective extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) which provide the mechanical stability for these biofilms. Little is known about the material properties of attached biofilms, making it difficult to predict how a biofilm will behave in response to an applied force. The work presented here measured the force-deflection characteristics of biofilm by two different techniques. The first method involved time lapse imaging of a biofilm grown in a capillary flow cell reactor under a constant fluid shear stress and the second method was based on micro-indentation using an atomic force microscope. For the flow cell experiments Staphylococcus epidermidis was grown in a capillary flow cell reactor. After a day of growth the biofilms received a pretreatment fluid shear while displacements were measured. The biofilms were then treated with different agents which alter the structure of the EPS matrix and thus change the mechanical properties/response of the biofilm. The four treatments examined in these experiments were FeCl 2, chlorhexidine, DispersinB&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;, and urea. The same fluid shear was applied after the fifteen minute treatment soak and the deflections were recorded. These measurements revealed that i) biofilms behave viscoelastically ii) FeCl 2 and chlorhexidine made the biofilm stiffer while urea and DispersinB&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; reduced the viscosity of the biofilm. For the micro-indentation experiments Staphylococcus epidermidis was grown in a drip-flow reactor. After four hours of growth the biofilms received a pretreatment indentation (5 microns depth) in which force-displacements were measured. The biofilms were then treated with FeCl 2, chlorhexidine, DispersinB&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;, and urea. The 5 microns indentation was applied after the fifteen minute treatment soak and force displacements were again measured. The measurements revealed that again i) biofilms behave viscoelastically ii) FeCl 2 and chlorhexidine made the biofilm stiffer while urea and DispersinB&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; reduced the viscosity of the biofilm. Quantification of biofilm material properties and demonstration that their properties can be altered by chemical or enzymatic treatments opens the door to development of new technologies for controlling detrimental biofilm based on targeting biofilm cohesion rather than killing microorganisms.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/brindle/BrindleE1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flow and transport studies of porous systems by magnetic resonance microscopy and Lattice Boltzmann simulations</field><field name="creator">Brosten, Tyler Ryan</field><field name="description">Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and Lattice-Boltzmann simulations are powerful techniques for studying pore scale dynamics in porous media. Several applications of these methods to the study of pore scale hydrodynamics and transport are discussed. Of special interest are concepts relating to pore structure characterization. In the first application it is shown that nuclear magnetic resonance measurements of pre-asymptotic transport dynamics in random open cell foams provide a characteristic structure length scale. These measurements and Lattice-Boltzmann simulations for a model foam structure demonstrate dynamical behavior similar to lower porosity consolidated granular porous media; suggesting a generalized approach to pore structure characterization. Normalizing the data by the characteristic length collapses data for different foam samples and mono-disperse packed beds. The non-equilibrium statistical mechanics theory of pre-asymptotic dispersion is used to model the hydrodynamic dispersive dynamics. In the second application transport of hard sphere colloidal particles under flow through an open cell foam is studied using nuclear magnetic resonance. The temporal dynamics of the colloidal particles and suspending fluid phase are obtained through spectral chemical resolution. The data is interpreted in the broader context of classic hydrodynamic dispersion theory and mechanisms of transport for each phase. In the third application pore scale hydrodynamics of flow over a model porous surface are investigated using three dimensional Lattice-Boltzmann simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance. The Lattice-Boltzmann and nuclear magnetic resonance data are used to interpret classic interfacial hydrodynamic boundary conditions.

Three accessory proteins, HydE, HydF, and HydG are required for maturation of the H-cluster. It has been proposed that the GTP-hydrolyzing protein HydF acts as a scaffold for assembly of the [2Fe] subcluster, which is then transferred to hydrogenase to produce the active enzyme[McGlynn, S.M.; Shepard, E.M.; Winslow, M.A.; Naumov, A.V.; Duschene, K.S.; Posewitz, M.C.; Broderick, W.E.; Broderick, J.B.; Peters, J.W. FEBS Lett. 2008, 582, 2183.]. The precise roles of HydE, HydF, and HydG in this process, however, remain unclear. The overall goal of this work is to study the role of HydF in hydrogenase maturation. In vivo studies have identified specific amino acid residues of HydF necessary for production of active hydrogenase [King, P.W.; Posewitz, M.C.; Ghirardi, M.L.; Seibert, M. J Bacteriol. 2006, 188, 2163.]. The objectives of this study were to: 1) investigate the involvement of each of these amino acid residues on the GTP hydrolyzing ability of HydF 2) examine the effects of structural and accessory hydrogenase proteins on rate of GTP hydrolysis 3) examine the importance of [Fe-S] cluster in HydF GTPase activity. GTPase assays were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results indicate mutations to conserved glycine residues in the GTP binding loop, and a potential iron ligand for the [Fe-S] cluster are deleterious to GTPase activity. Another mutation in the GTP binding loop involved in Mg&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm; coordination appears to have little effect on the rate of GTP hydrolysis. The two accessory proteins HydE and HydG increased GTPase activity, while the hydrogenase structural protein (HydA) appears to have little effect, supporting the suggestion that HydF acts as a scaffold. The presence or absence of an iron-sulfur cluster does not significantly affect GTPase activity. Together, these results suggest GTP hydrolysis does not play a role in transfer of activating elements to hydrogenase, but does play a role in hydrogenase maturation.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/bueling/BuelingA0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relevance of African American singing games to Xhosa children in South Africa: a qualitative study</field><field name="creator">Burns, Carolyn Diane</field><field name="description">In post-apartheid South Africa there has been a strong emphasis on teaching traditional music in the schools. Previously the music was greatly influenced by Western European and English systems. New standards were developed in the Arts and Culture Curriculum 2005. The purpose of this study was to explore how children in South Africa could be taught African American singing games, their perception and preferences, and how these songs would meet the new standards. A qualitative study was conducted with 69 Xhosa children in grades five and six at Good Shepherd Primary School in Grahamstown, South Africa. The learners were introduced to three African American singing games of which they had no prior knowledge. The songs were taught in the South African traditional manner; i.e., singing and moving simultaneously. Interviews were subsequently conducted with 47 learners and 5 families. The primary school teachers also provided information informally. The learners related their knowledge of African American singing games compared to their traditional Xhosa singing games and other music. They recognized a relationship between African American slavery and the apartheid era. A learner's preference of song was directly related to his previous experience with a Xhosa children's song or traditional music used for rites and rituals. Interviews with the teachers and parents were very positive indicators that the African American singing games should be included in the curriculum. Parents remembered and sang Freedom Songs and they indicated the need for their children to learn about other African cultures. The outcome of this study may provide South African teachers with materials to introduce African American folk music as an applicable source of multicultural music with African origins. The study suggests successful ways in which we teach multicultural music.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/burns/BurnsC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multicellular mathematical models of somitogenesis</field><field name="creator">Campanelli, Mark Benjamin</field><field name="description">Somitogenesis is an important pattern formation process in the developmental biology of vertebrates.

The first is a phenomenological phase oscillator model that reproduces both the clock and wavefront aspects of somitogenesis, but lacks a biological basis. The second is a biologically informed delay differential equation model of the clock-wave that is produced by coordinated oscillatory gene expression across many cells. Careful and efficient model construction, parameter estimation, and model validation identify important nonlinear mechanisms in the genetic control circuit of the somitogenesis clock. In particular, a graded control protein combined with differential decay of clock protein monomers and dimers is found to be a key mechanism for slowing oscillations and generating experimentally observed waves of gene expression. This represents a mode of combinatorial control that has not been previously examined in somitogenesis, and warrants further experimental and theoretical investigation.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/campanelli/CampanelliM0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Architecture and the motion of life</field><field name="creator">Carey, Katherine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">We experience our world through the mobile unit that is our body.

It also addresses the cultural, social and religious obstacles that girls, women and teachers face, while identifying appropriate recommendations for girls, women and teachers to improve their level of, and access to, educational opportunities. The methodology and data collection included formal and informal interviews, surveys and field notes gathered over a two-year period. The results of this study are shared in a narrative analysis of the experiences of teachers, young women and girls in the Seri Valley School community. Barriers to female education have great consequences for family and community health, potential home and community income, and the following generation's educational opportunities. As this study shows, even when girls are allowed to attend primary school, there are still many barriers that keep them from continuing on to higher education. Those barriers are: a shortage of well-educated female teachers, a supportive community that is open to girls continuing their education, and the significantly important approval of the influential male in the family allowing the girl or woman to continue her education. A result of these barriers is that female students in rural, isolated regions of Pakistan rarely go on to middle or high school for their education, therefore not improving the level of education for the population of female teachers and the future generation of girls. Breaking this cycle of depriving girls an education equal to boys needs to start with the community supporting access to schools, educating families about the benefits and importance of educating the female population, and providing opportunities for female teachers to continue their education and professional development.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/chabot/ChabotG1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student engagement: using the NSSE benchmarks to investigate longterm persistence</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Samuel Ross</field><field name="description">This study examined the relationship between student engagement and persistence for 362 first-time, full-time freshmen at a single institution of higher education. The enrollment status of the students was tracked through to the junior year of college. This allowed for three distinct groups of students to be identified for comparative purposes: non-persisters (students who failed to re-enroll at the institution after their freshman year); temporary persisters (students who re-enrolled in a fulltime status at the institution for their sophomore year but not for their junior year); and, longterm persisters (students who stayed enrolled at the institution in a fulltime status through to their junior year). A multinomial linear regression analysis compared the three groups across three models. The predictor variables used consist of: two measures of student engagement constructed from students' index scores on the National Survey of Student Engagement; students' ACT scores; parents' level of education; gender; and, residential status. Findings indicated that higher levels of engagement in the freshman year improve the likelihood of students persisting to the junior year regardless of the measured background characteristics. Higher index scores on the Supportive Campus Environment benchmark were found to be of central importance. These results support the notion that a focus on improving campus culture and on educational quality can help institutions improve retention rates. Also of importance, for temporary persisters the regression analysis highlighted the need for institutions to be more attentive to students' experiences of living on campus. Further research into the effects of living on campus on this group of students is recommended.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/chambers/ChambersS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel pharmaceutical combination confers protection from delayed cell death following transient cerebral ischemia</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Courtney Myfanwy</field><field name="description">Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability throughout the world; ischemia is the most common form of stroke. Medical procedures such as cardio-pulmonary bypass surgery can cause ischemic stroke can be caused. There are no treatments to limit neural impairment following stroke. The current research investigates neuroprotection offered by treatment with a novel drug combination consisting of Simvastatin&amp;acirc;&#8222;&amp;cent;, Gemfibrozil&amp;acirc;&#8222;&amp;cent;, Troglitazone&amp;acirc;&#8222;&amp;cent;, and Spironolactone&amp;acirc;&#8222;&amp;cent;. Animals were treated with the drug cocktail three weeks proceeding and one week subsequent to surgery. Ischemic insult was induced by clamping the carotid arteries for 5 min. Sham subjects underwent similar surgical procedures, but the carotids were not clamped. Twenty-four hrs following the surgical procedure locomotor activity was monitored in an open field for 5 min. Seven to fourteen days following ischemia or the sham procedure animals were sacrificed and sections containing the hippocampal CA1 region were mounted on slides and stained with cresyl violet. The CA1 region was rated on a 4-point scale for level of damage. Rodents generally show increased locomotor activity following transient global ischemia in an open field. In our study, ischemic animals that received vehicle demonstrated increased activity relative to the animals that received the drug treatment on all behavioral measures. Ischemic animals that received vehicle treatment had significantly more neural damage in the hippocampal CA1 region than ischemic animals receiving the drug. The appearance of neurons in the CA1 hippocampal regions of animals in the sham condition was not significantly different from ischemic animals in the drug treatment condition. It is concluded that the drug treatment is effective in offering neuroprotection during transient global ischemia. The next step is to characterize the biochemical mechanisms behind the neuroprotection conferred by the drug treatment. Contrasting the protein expression levels of animals receiving the vehicle treatment with animals receiving the drug treatment following an ischemic insult will assist in elucidating these pathways. Predictions are made regarding the biochemical mechanisms affected by the drug treatment based on previous research on the biochemical pathways affected by each pharmaceutical.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/chapman/ChapmanC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the venture captial legacy: an investigation of post-IPO performance and impact</field><field name="creator">Cochran, Andrew Carl</field><field name="description">While extensive literature documents the venture capital impact around the initial public offering, little is known about the enduring effects of venture financing.

Our built environment exhibits the ability to form expectations of the future, while conducting investigations into the past. Every place has an identity, a location, and a memory that characterizes its existence. Memory is a component that, at the moment, may be vacant within the context of our forgotten sites, our terrain vague. These places are currently unseen, ignored, or forgotten, but this does not mean the history is unworthy of resurrection. There is certainly a story that exists, that can classify, identify, and categorize the historic capacity of these places. Without paying homage to, and focusing awareness on our past, we risk losing it completely. As our industrial era evolves into the technological age, we face a decision: to bury our past industrial sites along with their collective memories, or embrace them well into the future. To address this topic I will research, plan, and design an appropriate solution to the port/waterfront area of Bellingham, Washington. This 170 acre location was once the home of the thriving Georgia Pacific pulp mill that has now been terminated due to economic changes. Not only has this site been socially forgotten, it has been physically mistreated and neglected with the introduction of toxins that affect and systematically dismantle the local ecology. The importance of this site is evident because it represents industrial sites throughout our coastlines that have been closed down and/or re-programmed. Without proper recognition, we will be unable to sustain the historical relevance of this site, along with many more. Our society should always keep one foot in the past while making a simultaneous stride towards the future.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/costanti/CostantiP0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the biomechanical response of a filiform hair array: a low Reynolds number fluid-structure model</field><field name="creator">Cummins, Breschine</field><field name="description">A model system that has been the subject of many anatomical, developmental, functional, and theoretical studies over the last 30 years is the cercal sensory system of the cricket. This system is composed of two antenna-like appendages covered with hundreds of filiform mechanosensory hairs, and encodes information about the direction and dynamics of low-velocity air currents. The encoding is determined by the biomechanical properties of the mechanosensory hairs. These properties are poorly understood, primarily because accurate experimental measurements of the air-current-driven movements of the hairs are difficult to obtain, and adequate mathematical tools for modeling arbitrarily complex hair-to-hair interactions within the canopy have been absent. The study presented here solves fundamental problems in both of these areas. Previous studies have characterized the biomechanics of the filiform hairs, but only one study considered the fluid-mediated interaction of closely-packed hairs. A major goal of our work was to model the motion of a dense patch of thin filaments driven by bulk fluid flow, in a context that is immediately relevant to the cercal system. To understand the function of the sensory epithelium as a whole, we developed a numerical model based on a novel mathematical tool: the method of regularized unsteady Stokeslets. This method is generally applicable to low Reynolds number fluid flow in domains that are subject to periodic forcing along the boundary. The numerical scheme associated with our mathematical model is fast, scalable, accounts for the interaction between arbitrary arrangements of hairs. We measured the biomechanical stimulus-response properties of 19 filiform hairs, and used that data to fit parameters to our mathematical model. We demonstrate for the first time that one of the mechanical parameters controlling filiform hair motion depends on the frequency of the air stimulus. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that damped and synergistic hair interactions can occur between closely-packed hairs. Low frequency signals (&lt; 50 Hz) are damped, and higher frequency signals (50-200 Hz) are amplified. We hypothesize that the characteristic dense patch of hairs at the proximal end of the cercus acts as a noise cancellation filter that removes low frequency components of ambient environmental stimuli.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/cummins/CumminsB0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical investigation of carbon nanotube devices for millimeter/submillimeter wave analog circuits</field><field name="creator">Daggett, Josephine Anne</field><field name="description">Carbon nanotubes have become a very exciting area of research in the field of nanoelectronics in the past few years. Diodes and transistors fabricated using carbon nanotubes are theoretically very promising. Although, experimentally these devices are challenging to successfully realize it is hoped that further research and improvements in fabrication procedures will yield devices which could match or surpass current CMOS technologies. However, there are still many areas that need to be improved before anyone sees these devices mass produced commercially. This thesis gives a detailed overview of the fundamentals of these devices which can be easily understood by someone with a typical electrical engineering background. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate both the theory behind these devices and to conduct a series of simulations in order to determine how they compare to ultimately scaled CMOS for high frequency applications by ignoring the challenges associated with fabricating these devices reliably. In other words, at best how could these devices perform if they could be mass produced with high yield compared to current technologies? First an introduction to carbon nanotubes and a review of relevant concepts from solid-state electronics will be given, followed by a brief overview of quantum theory for 1-D systems as it pertains to nanotube based electronics. This will then be used to develop models for a Schottky diode and Schottky barrier transistor. Simulations using these models were conducted that show the potential for these devices for high frequency electronics. These results are subsequently used to compare to current state-of-the-art technologies. Upon completion of the simulations in this thesis, it was determined that carbon nanotube based Schottky diodes and Schottky barrier transistors do not perform as well as current technologies in relation to applications for submillimeter/millimeter wave detection and analog circuits, even when assuming no limitations imposed due to poor fabrication.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/daggett/DaggettJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship factors and American Indian men's condom use intentions</field><field name="creator">Dick, Rebecca Nalle</field><field name="description">Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) pose a major threat to the public health of the United States. American Indians are disproportionately affected by STIs, including chlamydia and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Roosevelt County, which lies within the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana, has consistently reported chlamydia rates two to five times higher than national rates. Community leaders from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation partnered with researchers from Montana State University to address the reservation's sexual and reproductive health needs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the heterosexual relationship factors that were associated with condom use intentions for STD and HIV prevention in a purposive sample of American Indian men, ages 18 to 24, living on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. A community based participatory research (CBPR) approach was used for this study. A non-probability sample of American Indian men (n=122) were recruiting using consecutive and snowball sampling techniques. Study hypotheses were tested using Pearson's chi-squared and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis for bivariate associations and multinomial logistic regression for multivariate associations. Variables examined for their association with condom use intentions included age, educational attainment, relationship type, relationship duration, relationship commitment, condom use communication, condom use decision making, control of condom use, and negative partner reaction to condom use. Results indicated that American Indian men were less likely to use condoms for disease prevention as their age and their relationship commitment increased. Factors resulting in an increased likelihood of future condom use included high participation in the condom use decision making process and female control over condom use. Culturally relevant sexual risk prevention programs that work towards changing the perception of condoms in committed relationships and that engage men in sexual health decision making could help reduce the disproportionate burden of sexually transmitted disease carried by young American Indians living on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/dick/DickR0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibition of conifers growing under a deciduous canopy: degrees, seasonality, and causes of suppression</field><field name="creator">Dickman, Garrett Joseph</field><field name="description">The physiological response of conifers to a deciduous overstory is unstudied in the cool temperate zone despite the widespread occurrence of the association. The object of this study is therefore to determine the degree that understory conifers are inhibited by a deciduous overstory, and to identify the factors responsible. Thus, three conifer species (Juniperus scopulorum, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Abies lasiocarpa) growing with and without a deciduous Populus canopy were contrasted in regards to environment, seasonal performance, and physiological response to environmental factors. Understory conifer stands were darker, and especially so when the overstory had leaves. Understory environments of P. menziesii and A. lasiocarpa were cooler and had lower vapor pressure deficits than open sites, but were similar in relative humidity and soil water. In contrast, understory sites of J. scopulorum had similar temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and soil water. Relative to conifers in the open, photosynthesis of understory conifers was reduced by roughly the same amount (~10%), regardless of photosynthetic rate. While at intermittent times photosynthesis was reduced by much greater amounts, the expected increase of summertime suppression (&gt;10%) was not seen. Understory conifer suppression was not linked to any seasonally limited resource, such as light, water, or nutrients. The slight suppression over the year was due to an unidentified factor, perhaps the lower temperature of the understory environment (-2C), or seemingly unlikely, an allelopathic effect from Populus. In instantaneous measures, photosynthesis was better correlated with day of year and RH than light, VPD, or temperature. The correlated phenomena relate to season and precipitation rather than canopy condition under study. Slight photosynthetic inhibition of understory conifers is supported by similar observations of suppression in the diameter growth and one-year&amp;acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s twig growth.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/dickman/DickmanG1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecosystem dynamics and temporal variations in a microbially dominated, coastal antarctic lake</field><field name="creator">Dieser, Markus</field><field name="description">This study investigated the microbial ecology of Pony Lake, Antarctica. The main objectives of this research were to 1) characterize physicochemical parameters in Pony Lake during the transition from ice covered to ice free, 2) highlight seasonal and inter-seasonal alterations in lake parameters, 3) relate the physicochemical conditions in the ice and water column to microbial processes and community structure, 4) characterize the effects of phototransformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on its bioavailability to bacteria, and 5) demonstrate the role of carotenoid pigments in protecting cells against environmental stresses. Also included are results from three McMurdo Dry Valley lakes on the survivability of microbes encapsulated within the lake ice covers. The results of this study highlight the sensitivity of Antarctic environments and the close coupling of environmental conditions and biological processes. Inter-seasonal differences in weather conditions and snow accumulation strongly affected the physicochemistry of this lacustrine system. Biological processes were closely tied to the physicochemical lake conditions. As a consequence planktonic abundances, production rates, and community structure evolved distinctly in each year. Bacterial production was regulated by the quality of DOM. Whereas nutrient availability appeared to play a minor role in eutrophic Pony Lake water, it became more critical for microbial communities found within the ice column of Antarctic lakes. Especially in the ice cover of the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes, enhanced microbial diversity and survivability was associated with particles (nutrient enriched micro-zones) within an otherwise ultra-oligotrophic habitat. In Pony Lake ice, microbial activity and community structure differed with respect to different strata within the ice column, induced by freeze-concentration of solutes, bioavailability of DOM, and oxygen gradients. A comparison of carotenoid pigmented and non-pigmented heterotrophic bacteria indicated that pigmentation provides enhanced resistance to environmental stresses such as freeze-thaw cycles or solar radiation. Collectively, the Pony Lake data demonstrated that microorganisms that persist throughout the year were able to survive much more severe conditions while entrapped within the ice compared to those observed in the lake water during summer months. Further, this study contributes to a better understanding of the biogeochemical carbon cycle in a microbially dominated system.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/dieser/DieserM1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evidence based policy recommendation addressing body art among nursing personnel</field><field name="creator">Dorwart, Shawna Drugge</field><field name="description">Body art in the form of tattoos and piercings is becoming more prevalent as a form of self-expression.

With this increased prevalence many organizations are developing policies to address body art among employees. The intent of this project is to look specifically at policy development in regard to body art among nursing personnel. A thorough review of literature was carried out, exploring body art from multiple perspectives. In addition to examining body art, careful consideration was made for the aspects of nursing potentially impacted by body art. Beyond the review of literature this investigation was expanded to include communication with an expert in body art research. Contact was also made with organizations of varying sizes to establish what policy statements currently exist regarding body art among nursing personnel. During these contacts rationale and references serving as a basis for these policies were also investigated. The desired outcome of the analysis was to identify evidence to support a body art policy among nursing personnel that provided for the well-being and safety of the patients while allowing the nursing staff as much personal freedom as possible. The results of the investigation revealed a lack of evidence identifying the prevalence of body art among nurses, or the impact of body art among nursing personnel on patient outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/dorwart/DorwartS0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Chippewa Cree students' college experience: factors affecting persistence</field><field name="creator">Drummer, Kadene Sue</field><field name="description">Educators working with Chippewa Cree students need to understand how the students' precollege experiences, college experiences, and cultural backgrounds influence their success in higher education in order to design learning environments, procedures, and policies that will increase the graduation rate of this population. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore factors that help or hinder successful completion of a bachelor's degree by students from the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Data was collected in face-to-face interviews using a peer-reviewed interview protocol consisting of open-ended questions for graduates and student services personnel determined by the concepts identified after examination of related literature. Thirty graduates from the Chippewa Cree Tribe and 5 student services personnel from two state colleges in Montana were interviewed. Factors that the graduates found most relevant to their success were family, personal goal, friends, institutional support, and academic preparation. The greatest obstacles they reported were finances, loneliness, commuting, life responsibilities, discouragement, unpreparedness for college work, lack of study skills, and lack of time-management skills. Suggestions to improve the graduation rate for new students included persistence, responsibility, preparation for the transition from high school to college, time management, willingness to leave their comfort zone and develop their social skills, study skills, class attendance, willingness to ask for help, lack of discouragement, academic preparedness, and completion of school work. Recommendations include designing recruiting and retention strategies to meet the specific needs of the Native American student, collaborating with K-12 schools and the community to develop programs that encourage early preparation for college, establishing and advertising Native American centers on campuses, organizing professional development seminars on diversity issues designed to give faculty and staff a safe environment to explore different cultures, encouraging increased faculty-student interactions, creating an advisory committee charged with increasing Native American student retention, recognizing and giving appreciation for success, developing a comprehensive college finance and budgeting workshop that includes the student's whole family, and developing and maintaining an up-to-date data base within the Chippewa Cree Tribe to collect data on educational and cultural issues.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/drummer/DrummerK0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutions, third-parties, and water markets: an analysis of the role of water rights, the no-injury rule, and Water Code 386 on water markets in California counties</field><field name="creator">Dutkowsky, Monique Renee</field><field name="description">Given the apparently large potential gains from the trade of water, why do we observe so few market transactions? This paper argues that policy-driven transaction costs are an important trade-hindering factor. More specifically, this paper examines the allocation of property rights under the No-Injury Rule, which gives rights to riparian users, and Water Code 386, which gives quasi-blocking rights to third-parties, making water rights less clear. Both laws are predicted to decrease the likelihood of observing an active export market and the volume of exports in the county. To test these predictions, this paper uses the cross sectional variation in the number of riparian rights holders and the number of third-parties to estimate their effect on all county-level water trades in California from 1990 to 2001. The empirical results show that the effect of Water Code 386 on exports is inconclusive. The results for the No-Injury Rule indicates that for the average county, a one standard deviation increase in the ratio of riparian rights holders to the total population will decrease the likelihood that the county will have an active export market by 30 percent and will decrease the ratio of exports to appropriations by 7.4 percent. This suggests that if California's goal is, as stated in the 1970's, to reallocate water to its highest valued use via water markets, the current allocation of property rights may be creating policy-driven costs that hinder reaching that goal.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/dutkowsky/DutkowskyM0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting medical-surgical area nurses' compliance with contact precautions</field><field name="creator">Eby, Anne Kathryn</field><field name="description">Multidrug-resistant organisms are a significant threat in health care facilities, and are associated with many adverse consequences for infected patients. However, despite these concerns and the evidence that contact precautions are an effective way to address them, compliance with contact precautions guidelines among health care workers remains low (Farr, 2000). The primary goal of this study was to examine factors affecting medical-surgical nurses' compliance with contact precautions guidelines when caring for patients colonized by or infected with multidrug-resistant organisms. A secondary purpose of this study was to describe demographic characteristics of medical-surgical nurses to determine if certain characteristics (e.g. age, time in practice, level of education) had a relationship with their compliance in using contact precautions guidelines. Finally, this study examined barriers to the use of contact precautions and consequences for failure to follow contact precautions guidelines. A survey tool was developed by the researcher for this study to examine these questions, and an exploratory, cross-sectional, correlation descriptive study was conducted. The study group was made up primarily of female nurses with associate or bachelor degrees. Nurses from the orthopedic and neurosurgery unit made up the largest percentage of respondents. All respondents indicated that they were familiar with CP guidelines. Eight primary barriers to the use of contact precautions were listed by participants. Half of the participants listed one of the time management categories ("no time" or "urgency") as the primary barrier to compliance with contact precautions. Participants' age, years experience and level of education were not statistically significant predictors of the participants' level of compliance. There was not a statistically significant difference between the barriers to compliance groups (no time/urgency versus other) on their ability to comply with contact precautions. Lastly, there was not a statistically significant relationship among the primary consequence of non-compliance with CP guidelines (medical versus other) and the participants' level of compliance (low versus high).</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/eby/EbyA1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of actuators and sensors into composite structures</field><field name="creator">Ehresman, Jonathan David</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient wind turbine blades is growing in our society. One step in accomplishing this task would be to make wind turbines blades into smart structures. A smart structure is one that incorporates sensors, complete control systems, and active control devices, in order to shed, or redistribute the load placed on the structure. For wind turbine blades this means changing the shape of the blade profile as it encounters different wind conditions. In order to have active control surfaces functioning on wind turbine blades, the existing blades would have to be retrofitted, and the new blades being manufactured would have to be redesigned. There are different control surfaces to consider: gurney flaps and false wall flaps are two that can perturb the boundary layer across the low pressure side of the wing. A flat plate and blade section test bed will be manufactured in order to gather empirical data from wind tunnel testing. For actuation of the control surface there are many choices: electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, and electro-hydrostatic. These actuator types will be investigated under a set of criterion to determine the best one for turbine blade application. Sensors will be investigated with respect to their use in sensing strain, temperature, acceleration, humidity, and delamination. Sensors are also used for health monitoring. This helps engineers design under a damage tolerant philosophy as opposed to a safe life structure philosophy. These sensors will be placed into laminates and different surface treatments will be reviewed to find the best configuration for each sensor. The sensor will be cleaned with isopropyl alcohol, dipped in a 20% by mass solution of nitric acid, and submerged in a 20% by mass solution of nitric acid for 10 seconds. Detailed surface images will be taken of sensors with different surface treatments in order to better understand the bonding between the sensor and laminate. These images indicate that submerging the sensors into 20% by mass solution of nitric acid is the best surface treatment.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/ehresman/EhresmanJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">[Re] defining transit culture</field><field name="creator">Ernst, Jeffrey Troy</field><field name="description">Environmental concerns and energy crisis have heightened awareness of energy consumption and instigated thought into alternative and updated means of travel.

Once reflection was defined and operationalized, a discourse analysis rubric was designed to identify elements of non reflective and reflective discourse used by participants in an online content-based mentoring and induction professional development program, e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS). The rubric was used to conduct a content analysis of online discourse between novice and experienced science teachers participating in the eMSS program. Coders determined which elements of non reflective and reflective discourse, including levels of discourse, were used by different types of participants in the various online discussion areas of the eMSS program. The results of this study showed a higher percentage of novice science teachers' messages were coded as containing overall higher levels of reflective discourse. This difference was partly attributed to the different roles experienced and novice science teachers have in this program. The different eMSS online discussion areas had varying percentages of messages identified as containing different levels of reflective discourse. Different discussion area curriculums, including types of discussion prompts and methods of facilitation, partly attributed to these differences. This study showed the importance of being intentional in the wording or modeling of what is expected from participants as they compose their messages. This study also showed that eliciting reflective thought processes from program participants depends on a variety of factors and can be contextual. No single factor stood out as essential to consistently encouraging reflective thought processes. Recommendations are made for designing program curriculums and facilitating the type of learning that results in the use of reflective thought by program participants.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/farrar/FarrarB1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human capital accumulation among Native Americans: an empirical analysis of the national assessment of educational progress</field><field name="creator">Fischer, Stefanie Jane</field><field name="description">Native Americans have low levels of human capital accumulation. In 2005, only 21% scored at the proficient level on the NAEP math test compared with 37% of all other test takers. One cause of their low human capital accumulation may be factors that commonly explain low academic performance among other minority groups within the United States, such as school quality and family background. Alternatively, Native American students may perform low academically due to factors that are unique to this population such as living on Native land or the political institutions that govern them. This paper will empirically examine Native American students' human capital accumulation decisions. Using data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), I find Native American students residing on Native land score 1/4 of a standard deviation lower on the math assessment than Native American students living off Native land, with no other controls added. After controlling for other area characteristics, family background, peer effects and school resources, the effect of living on Native land is not statistically significant in explaining test scores. Family background and peer effects explain most of the variation in Native American students' human capital accumulation decision. Students who identify with the white peer group score 1/5 of a standard deviation higher than students who identify with the Native American peer group. Although legal institutions do not explain student test scores, they do appear to affect students' attendance. Students living in areas under tribal jurisdiction are 13% more likely to miss a week or more of school in a month, ceteris paribus.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/fischer/FischerS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Million Dollar Blocks</field><field name="creator">Flink, Stephen Sperling</field><field name="description">Public housing in today's society is an accumulation of truths. These truths are a construct of institutions that are vastly different and sometimes conflicting but control and arrange life within the community. Public housing has transformed into a place of actual and perceived boundaries which constrict the control residents possess within the housing and its surroundings. The lack of control socially segregates, isolates, and stigmatizes residents as well as creates a dangerous environment. The residents' exclusion from outside communities prohibits them from functioning cohesively within society. With the objective of reducing crime rates, this thesis focuses on the physical environment's ability to transform the strict boundaries which separate public and private space within public housing. Blurring the influence of existing private spaces will give residents the ability to express territoriality within the public housing complex. A new order will be generated through localized interrelationships of private and public spaces. This environmental transformation will give residents among the public housing a sense of territoriality and the ability for self surveillance within their community. Inducing modes of habitation found outside of the public housing paradigm will return much needed control of space to the residents within the community.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/flink/FlinkS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of postfire salvage logging on Black-backed woodpecker nest-site selection and nest survival</field><field name="creator">Forristal, Christopher David</field><field name="description">Post-fire timber harvest practices (i.e. post-fire salvage logging) on public lands are a highly contentious issue in the western United States. Harvest of burned trees impacts a number of species, particularly those specialized for using post-wildfire habitats. We assessed the effects of post-fire salvage logging on black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) nest-site selection and nest survival within burned, mixed conifer forests of south-central Oregon. Multiple treatment and control plots were surveyed two years pre-logging (2003-04) and two years post-logging (2005-06). Our objectives were to (a) examine the effects of salvage logging on black-backed woodpecker nest site selection and nest survival at coarse and fine spatial scales (b) elucidate additional habitat and abiotic factors predicting black-back nest occurrence and survival, and (c) determine if those habitat covariates influencing nest site selection coincide with those influencing nest survival. A total of 210 black-backed woodpecker nests were monitored during the four year postfire period. Postfire salvage logging did not significantly reduce snag numbers or diameters within treatment units. Based upon our best nest-site selection model, black-backed woodpecker nest locations were different from non-nest points in habitat characteristics at both fine and coarse spatial scales, with variables related to surrounding snag density being the strongest predictors. Black-backed woodpeckers exhibited high overall nest survival (78.5%; 95% CL = 0.6996, 0.8495). Nest survival models containing temporal predictors (i.e. Julian date) received more support than those related to salvage harvest or other habitat features. Factors influencing black-backed woodpecker nest-site selection were not same as those affecting nest survival, suggesting a lack of adaptive nest-site choice in terms of nest survival. Our results correspond with past studies outlining the importance of high-density snag areas for woodpecker nesting. Maintaining complete snag species composition and high snag densities will help conserve black-backed woodpecker nesting habitat in the early years following stand-replacement wildfire.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/forristal/ForristalC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analyzing the effect of passing-lanes on rural two-lane highway operations</field><field name="creator">Freedman, Zachary Sebastian</field><field name="description">Two-lane highways make up 80% of roads in this country. Rural two-lane highways are unique in they are typically characterized by high-speeds and low volumes. Level-of-service is associated with the proportion of vehicles stuck in platoons, or the percentage of vehicles impeded by a slow-moving vehicle. The Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM 2000) recommends determining the percentage of vehicles stuck in a platoon using a performance measure called Percent Time Spent Following (PTSF). Because PTSF is nearly impossible to measure in the field, the HCM has proposed two methods for estimating its value. However, there are inconsistencies between the two methods. This limitation has led researchers to seek more appropriate performance measures for two-lane highways. When performance on these highways deteriorates to the point of needing an upgrade, the addition of a passing-lane is considered. A passing-lane is an extra lane in one or both directions of travel. The current design standards for passing-lanes (length and frequency) are based on simulation research conducted more than 20 years ago. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze traffic stream characteristics within and around a passing-lane as to improve design standards. Three appropriate performance measures were used to analyze data from two passing-lane sites in Montana. The purpose of this analysis was to determine passing lane effective length. The results showed this value may be greater than 6.6 miles. Lane use within a passing-lane section was also investigated. Traffic counters were placed at pre-determined locations within a passing-lane and data were recorded. Analysis of the data showed that aggressive drivers in the left lane are able to drive at 10 miles-per-hour faster than they were traveling as they entered the three-lane section. Further analysis showed that nearly all passing maneuvers of slower vehicles were conducted in the first 1/2-mile of the passing-lane. This thesis found the most appropriate performance measures for investigating passing-lanes are Percent Followers, Percent Impeded, and Follower Density. Also, the required spacing of passing-lanes on a two-lane highway may be farther than the current standards recommend. Lastly, for the site investigated a 3/4-mile long passing-lane would have been adequate.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/freedman/FreedmanZ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability and habitation in Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Friend, Scott Harris</field><field name="description">In the extreme climate and isolation of Antarctica, much of the built environment exists only as an assemblage of sterile boxes placed in the landscape without consideration of the needs of their occupants or their impact on the environment. In an area of limited resources, an abundance of solar and wind resources is seldom utilized to its full potential. Scientists and support crews spend months at a time living in isolation within the confines of small outposts and stations. Confinement in cramped and impersonal surroundings in this hostile environment can have devastating effects on the health and well-being of research teams and crews. The designs of many facilities rarely venture beyond the minimum programmatic requirements, failing to explore the possibility to become something more. The purely functional engineer's design approach, focusing heavily on initial cost, has been the mainstay of Antarctic architecture until recently. This attitude is beginning to be challenged by designs that focus on sustainability and the psychological impact on their inhabitants. Isolation and climactic conditions should not serve as an excuse for an incohesive atomistic design, but as motivation for a responsible, holistic solution. The technology exists to drastically reduce our negative environmental and carbon footprint in Antarctica by creating more responsible research facilities that fully utilize available renewable energy resources, while providing a superior working and living environment that meets the physical and psychological needs of its occupants. During the austral summer of 2008-2009, the world's first zero emissions polar research station is set to open. The innovative design of the Belgian Princess Elisabeth station can be used as a model for studying the potentials of sustainable and climactically adapted architectural design in Antarctica. I propose to further explore the possibilities of renewable energy, waste management, and prefabrication to design a zero emissions research facility with minimal impact that is responsive to its environment, while adequately providing for the needs of its occupants within the unique and extreme conditions of the Antarctic.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/friend/FriendS1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Montana agricultural land prices: an evaluation of recreational amenities and production characteristics</field><field name="creator">Baird, Fritz Patrick</field><field name="description">A hedonic price regression model is used to estimate the contributions of amenities to agricultural land values.

Research indicates that the patient satisfaction scores in many emergency departments (EDs) around the world are low. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of scripting by nurses in the Emergency Department to increase patient satisfaction scores. Satisfaction scores have decreased tremendously in EDs all around the world. Improving emergency department patient satisfaction scores has been studied from several approaches, with a common theme being a lack of communication between emergency department staff and their patients. One method in particular that might help to foster better communication is the use of scripting by the nursing staff. The study design was a quantitative research study using overall patient satisfaction scores as well as well as scores from individual communication questions during the pre-scripting and post-scripting time frames to examine the use of scripting by emergency department nursing staff and its relationship to the increase in patient satisfaction scores. A retrospective, longitudinal analysis was conducted of patient satisfaction scores before and after the implementation of scripting by emergency department nursing staff. This was done to determine if there was an increase in the patient satisfaction scores. The primary focus of this study was patient satisfaction and its association with perception of care in the ED. This includes communication with patients regarding their perception of care as it relates to the process of informing patients about their specific tests and procedures. However, because no statistical analysis could be done, the null hypotheses were accepted.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/fuller/FullerM0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative forum at Montana State University</field><field name="creator">Fullerton, Tyler Barlow</field><field name="description">The creative process is a key element to generating great architecture, art and science.

Previous research has indicated that pregnant women do not meet current DHA recommendations of 200 mg per day. Much of the research has been conducted in coastal communities with greater access to marine sources and may not reflect non-coastal communities. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe maternal DHA intake in pregnant women from Southwest Montana and to determine changes in dietary DHA intake over time. METHODS: Thirty-nine participants were asked to complete a non-consecutive 3-day diet record and a DHA focused food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at weeks 18, 28 and 35 (&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 1 week). Maternal fasted plasma and red blood cell samples were obtained via venipuncture during the same data collection periods. Fetal cord blood samples were collected at delivery. Due to time restrictions, all blood lipid parameters were undetermined. After delivery, participants completed a post-partum survey. RESULTS: Participants' overall mean (MEAN &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; SD (min. - max.)) DHA intake was 248 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 321 mg/d (8 - 1,836 mg/d). According to those who reported using DHA supplements in their FFQ interviews at weeks 18 (n = 12), 28 (n = 13) and 35 (n = 11), the mean DHA intake was 272 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 380 mg/d (147 - 1,490 mg/d). The mean DHA intake among non-supplement users at weeks 18 (n = 22), 28 (n = 20) and 35 (n = 21) was 147 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 139 mg/d (8 - 555 mg/d). Dietary DHA intake from weeks 18, 28 and 35 did not differ significantly (F (2, 62) = 0.220, p = 0.803). CONCLUSION: Dietary DHA intake did not differ over time. The mean dietary DHA intake for non-supplement users was below the current prenatal recommendation. Therefore, pregnant women in Southwest Montana are not meeting current DHA recommendations through dietary means alone and should consider DHA supplementation as a method to meet fetal and maternal DHA needs during pregnancy.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/gelfer/GelferG0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re up? You're crazy!: retention versus mobility in today's army</field><field name="creator">George, Joe Webb</field><field name="description">Retention practices in the U.S. Army face an incentive problem. The amount of work that officers undertake to retain a soldier should be based in part on those officers' expectations of accruing benefits. In this paper, I analyze Army National Guard retention rates to see if the possible mobility of a soldier (which affects his leadership's expected benefits) is systematically related to the probability he will be retained. A soldier's mobility translates into competition among military units for that soldier's service. There are two possible and contradictory effects of this competition. The first is the standard microeconomic effect of increasing competition in a monopsonistic environment. This would be expected to increase quantity (in this case, the quantity of soldiers retained). The second, less intuitive effect is that competition among battalions reduces a soldier's ability to effectively commit to long-term service with any battalion. This causes a reduction in quantity. I have found that the second effect dominates. This paper contributes to economic literature by improving the understanding of incentives in large organizations.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/george/GeorgeJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ichthyoplankton density and Shovelnose sturgeon spawning in relation to varying discharge treatments</field><field name="creator">Goodman, Benjamin Joseph</field><field name="description">Many lotic fish species use natural patterns of variation in discharge and water temperature as spawning cues and these natural patterns are often altered by river regulation. The effects of spring discharge and water temperature variation on the spawning of shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus and other fishes in the upper Missouri River have not been well documented. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, I had the unique opportunity to study the effects of experimental discharge levels on ichthyoplankton density in the lower Marias River, a regulated tributary to the upper Missouri River. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of contrasting discharge treatments and water temperature variation on spatial and temporal variation in spawning of shovelnose sturgeon (and other species sampled as bycatch) as measured by embryonic and larval fish density in the lower Marias River. Ichthyoplankton was sampled about every four days in June and July of 2006, 2007, and 2008. Overall larval fish density was greater in 2006 than in 2007, and increased density was associated with increased discharge in 2006. In 2006, shovelnose sturgeon spawning occurred in the Marias River in conjunction with the ascending, peak (134 m 3/s), and descending portions of the spring hydrograph and water temperatures from 16 oC to 19 oC. No evidence of sturgeon spawning was documented in the lower Marias River in 2007 when peak discharge remained low (9 m 3/s to 14 m 3/s) despite the occurrence of water temperatures suitable for shovelnose sturgeon embryo development. In 2008, shovelnose sturgeon spawning occurred in conjunction with the peak (118 m 3/s) and descending portions of the spring hydrograph, and during a prolonged period of increased discharge (28 m 3/s to 39 m 3/s), coupled with water temperatures from 11 oC to 23 oC in the lower Marias River. These data suggest that discharge must reach a threshold level (28 m 3/s), and should be coupled with water temperatures suitable (12 oC to 24 oC) or optimal (16 oC to 20 oC) for shovelnose sturgeon embryo development, to provide a spawning cue to shovelnose sturgeon in the lower Marias River.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/goodman/GoodmanB0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A degree day model of sheep grazing influence on alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica</field><field name="creator">Goosey, Hayes Blake</field><field name="description">Alfalfa, Medicago sativa (L.), is produced on approximately 720,000 ha in Montana and is the foremost forage crop in many high, semiarid, intermountain states. Two biological stressors (insects and weeds) combined with poor field management are primarily responsible for reduced alfalfa production. In the U.S. alone, arthropods cause an estimated $260 million loss to alfalfa with the alfalfa weevil (AW), Hypera postica Gyllenhal, being the most damaging phytophagous pest in the United States. Using degree days as predictors for initiation and cessation of arthropod IPM programs is a common practice and on-line degree day calculators using regional temperature data are providing equal accuracy as on-site estimates. Grazing is emerging as a legitimate IPM tactic however there is no published literature using degree days to implement an IPM based grazing systems. A degree day predictive model is needed, as a producer decision and support tool, to improve the effectiveness of strategic sheep grazing to manage alfalfa weevil. Grazing treatments exclosures were established in a randomized complete block design at weekly intervals giving each treatment a unique degree day and stocking rate. Degree days calculated from both on-site and near-site data produced the same model accuracy. Therefore, the near-site model was selected to encourage use by producers. Treatments meeting the selection criteria (G3, G4, G5) were 'modeled' together and a simple linear regression (P &lt; 0.01) was calculated predicting AW larval populations based on stocking rate and degree day. Harvest sample treatment DM did not differ (P &gt; 0.16). However, NDF, CP, and Yield differed (P &lt; 0.01) between treatments. Due to an interaction (P &lt; 0.01), ADF and TDN were separated by year and did not differ P = 0.93 during 2008, but did (P &lt; 0.01) during 2009. Based on yield and nutritive differences between treatments, a simple regression (P &lt; 0.01) of plant RGR was calculated to predict when yield and nutritive characteristics of the modeled and less extensively grazed 'alternative' (NG, G1, G2) treatments would equal. The equation predicted that producers would need to wait an average of four days for treatment harvest characteristics to equal.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/goosey/GooseyH1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postmodernism, Native American literature and issues of sovereignty</field><field name="creator">Gorelova, Olena</field><field name="description">Criticism of Native American literature is barely two centuries old, while criticism of Western literature boasts a history that is quite a bit longer. The questions on how to read and interpret tribal narrative and modern American Indian fiction are still urgent topics that trigger numerous debates among literary scholars. What theories to employ and what approaches to use to dispel misinterpretations of the literature are still matters open to suggestion. Postmodernism, the new world trend, has influenced all spheres of life, not excluding literature. Although it does seem to better account for American Indian voices as it shifts attention to local narratives and re-evaluation of history, the issue of whether it is applicable and favorable to Native American literature and its cause is a debatable one. Postmodern theory claims to liberate the suppressed voices including those of Native Americans, but at the same time presents the danger of limiting Native American literature to another set of frames while denying it its purpose, i.e. achievement of the establishment of Native American national literature. Many American Indian scholars insist that American Indian literature should not be interpreted using mainstream approaches, such as postmodernism, since they have already done enough damage, but implementing American Indian philosophies instead, such as nationalism. It also seems premature to apply postmodern theory since it deconstructs history and identity, which are still to be constructed in Native American literature. Tribal literature and tribal realities are closely connected and, therefore, the fight for Native American literature and how to interpret it appears to be a part of a bigger fight, the one for sovereignty, both national and intellectual. The "post" of postmodernism, as well as the "post" of post-colonialism, might simply not be present for Native American literature yet and, therefore, theories offered by nationalism can at the given moment be more promising to American Indian literature and its purposes.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/gorelova/GorelovaO0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity: psychological relationships between place and occupant informing Burmese refugee communal design</field><field name="creator">Gould, Shawn Patrick</field><field name="description">Place is an active participant in determining who we are; it becomes part of one's identity. People use space as a vehicle in which individual and social experiences are carried out and remembered, ultimately shaping who one is. An attachment to place is formed. Place becomes vital to one's mental being and survival because it is a piece of a whole in how one defines herself/himself and his purpose. But what happens when place attachment is broken? The consequences can be severe. For example, Burmese refugees responding to political persecution, persistent poverty, and most recently the ramifications of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008, were forced to abandon their homes and communities---- their place. They lost part of their identity. In doing so, the already dire situation they experienced grew more grievous. This continues today. Now these refugees congregate in camps along the Burmese/Thai border looking for relief. Only tactile issues (food, shelter, water) are addressed by relief agencies, not psychological issues, such as the part of their identity they have lost. Because of this oversight , their recovery and survival lay in jeopardy. This thesis will seek to demonstrate how architecture can ascribe to various design considerations that acknowledge the importance of fundamental place attachment between occupant and place. I will illustrate these considerations by creating a community for Burmese refugees that recognizes not only the physical but the psychological factors that are imperative to recovery, such as self, social, and place identity. Ultimately this exploration hopes to instill identity back into the refugees by applying a design strategy when developing the community that is informed by the interactions of the aforementioned psychological factors. These issues of identity are pertinent to design today, when increasingly, many people like the Burmese refugee are in situations that demand thought and action for their recovery and survival.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/gould/GouldS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioral responses of elk to winter wolf predation risk in the Madison Headwaters Area, Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Gower, Claire Natasha</field><field name="description">Over the past few decades a large body of literature has provided evidence that predators can influence the ways in which prey behave. This in turn may influence prey demography and predator-prey dynamics and therefore predators may influence the structure and function of populations and communities, independent of direct killing. Using data collected from 1991 to 2007, I evaluated the behavior of elk (Cervus elaphus) in the Madison headwaters area of Yellowstone National Park in response to the colonization and establishment of wolves (Canis lupus). Changes in home range size, fidelity, group size, foraging behavior, and large-scale spatial responses were evaluated. After wolf colonization, elk movements were more dynamic as elk moved more over the landscape as they were increasingly encountered, attacked, and displaced by wolves. Home range sizes were larger, with slight decreases in fidelity. These results show that elk made modest adjustments in space use presumably to reduce their vulnerability from predators at a fine-scale within their range. More dramatic larger scale spatial shifts were also documented as radio-collared elk adopted long-distance dispersal and migratory movements away from high-density wolf areas. These apparent predator-avoidance movements were never observed prior to wolf colonization or from areas where the risk of predation was lower. Prior to wolf colonization, the grouping behavior of elk was relatively stable and predictable as elk attempted to conserve energy and decrease starvation risk in the absence of wolves. Following wolf reintroduction group size and group size variation increased. This more dynamic behavior likely reflects a strategy to minimize predation risk and maximize food acquisition. The decision to forage was heavily influenced by local snow, habitat type, and time of day but remained relatively stable with and without the presence of wolves. The lack of any substantial change in the foraging behavior of elk in the presence of wolves illustrates that elk can maintain the same level of foraging time and retain a relatively constant level of nutrition. Together these results suggest that in a harsh winter environment such as the Madison headwaters, elk can adaptively manage their behavior to cope with environmental constraints both in the presence and absence of wolves. Landscape variation such as snow pack severity and habitat types, complexity, and patch size also influences predation risk and may dictate the way in which prey behave.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/gower/GowerC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low cost range and attitude determination solution for small satellite platforms</field><field name="creator">Greenfield, Nathan Joseph</field><field name="description">The ability to determine the range and attitude between two satellites can be a challenging venture. It can be made more challenging when considering the use of such a system on a small satellite. Successful implementation of a small and low power range and attitude sensor could open potential doors to multiple small satellite constellations and formation flying maneuvers. After successfully demonstrating an electromagnetic docking system on a one-dimensional air track, it was determined that continued work into two and three-dimensional systems would require a more functional range and attitude sensor than was originally used. Such a sensor would have to be small enough for use aboard a small satellite, require little power while operating and provide accurate data over the required range of operation, all while maintaining a minimal monetary cost. The SATellite Range and Attitude Imaging SystEm (SATRAISE) was developed to meet this demand. In order to meet all of the listed requirements, a system based on an embedded Linux computer platform was developed. The hardware for the system utilized consumer grade, commercially available parts, including a standard computer webcam and LEDs. The software for the system made use of existing image processing libraries in order to facilitate the detection and identification of target points in frames captured by the webcam. Following successful integration of the hardware and implementation of the required software, the SATRAISE was characterized under a variety of operating conditions in order to verify the accuracy, stability and power requirements of the system.

I propose that, unlike the empirical sensibility, what I will call the literary sensibility is, at heart, a non-violent means for creating and recreating understanding. When the literary sensibility is used to negotiate the unknown into the known, each subjective participant in the encounter is able to grant and maintain his or her own integrity as well as the integrity of all other subjective participants as subjects. I define my understanding of the literary sensibility by engaging the work of Jacques Derrida, who is himself concerned with the philosophy of literature and the literary. I show that because of limitations within his understanding of subjectivity, the deconstructive interpretive act is ultimately violent. Derrida maintains a formal impossibility that would allow a subject to recognize an Other as a subject, and without this possibility, a subject can only objectify the Other, an act of subjugation and violence in which the Other has no agency to define terms (or itself). Derrida, I think, understands the violence of objectification and subjugation, but because he maintains the impossibility of understanding the Other as a subject, Derrida can only resolve the problem by perpetually deferring what, for him, is inevitable violence. Therefore, Derrida's treatment of the literary is at odds with what the literary sensibility can truly accomplish. In A Room with a View, E.M. Forster demonstrates and represents what I consider to be the subjective moment influenced by the literary sensibility. By engaging this work, I argue that we can maintain a possibility for re-constructing a dialogic meaning making process that allows for the same qualities of deferral, multiplicity, simultaneity, and literariness that deconstruction affords and prioritizes while, at the same time, providing an invitation to non-violent practice.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/gunderson/GundersonK0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frameworks: empowering place in the face of a universal world</field><field name="creator">Hall, Peter Leland</field><field name="description">The Flathead Valley stands on the edge of a precipice, staring down the destruction of its culture, ecology, landscape, and economy as it is quickly being filled to the brim. This destruction has become apparent to many locals and visitors and is starting to generate serious concerns. The problem of irresponsible rural development is one that has frustrated conservationists since the first skeptics of the industrial revolution. No one really wants to be a part of the systematic destruction of small town charm, open and natural landscapes, or functioning ecosystems; but, so many people want to live a life surrounded by these qualities. And right there is the problem. Traditional solutions to this problem have been regulations through zoning which, if actually protecting these qualities, slows economies. The other alternative is the short-term-minded capitalization of open space into money by means of developments. Neither of these solutions actually address the problem. A strategy that I would like to propose in place of these largely unsuccessful strategies is one that asks the question, why can't the forces that drive the demand for development also drive the sustainability of everything that is that place? A solution that recognizes the plight of locals and the desires of immigrants. Through clever and creative planning and design, entities can be introduced into a rural area and prove to embrace local culture, open space, and ecology, while being economically sustainable.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/hall/HallP1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Classical mechanics with dissipative constraints</field><field name="creator">Harker, Shaun Russell</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to consider the mathematical treatment of mechanical systems in the presence of constraints which are energetically dissipative. Constraints may be energetically dissipative due to impacts and friction. In the frictionless setting, we generalize Hamilton's principle of stationary action, central to the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanics, to reflect optimality conditions in constrained spaces. We show that this generalization leads to the standard measure-theoretic equations for shocks in the presence of unilateral constraints. Previously, these equations were simply postulated; we derive them from a fundamental variational principle. We also present results in the frictional setting. We survey the extensive literature on the subject, which focusses on existence results and numerical schemes known as time- stepping algorithms. We consider a novel model of friction (which is more dissipative than standard Coulomb friction) for which we can give better well-posedness results than what is currently available for the Coulomb theory. To this end, we study multi-valued maps, differential inclusions, and optimization theory. We construct a differential inclusion we call the feedback problem, for which the multi-valued map is the solution set of a convex program. We give existence and uniqueness results regarding this feedback problem. We cast the persistent contact evolution problem of our novel model of friction into the form of a feedback problem to derive an existence result.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/harker/HarkerS0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subalpine Wetlands: characterization, environmental drivers, and response to human peturbation and restoration</field><field name="creator">Heikes-Knapton, Sunni Marie</field><field name="description">The subalpine region throughout the western US is increasingly pressured by land use changes. Consequences of these changes often involve major alteration to the original function of the landscape, particularly concerning wetland and riparian areas. In southwest Montana, large developments have recently been created or expanded in the subalpine environment. Wetlands in these regions bear a particularly unique structure, and often are influenced by the effects of development. The alteration to structure can result in disturbance to the original hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical functions of wetlands. Restoration efforts attempt to mitigate for development influences, but the monitoring and success criteria do not wholly address the functional attributes of these features. At the same time, little is known about the structure of undisturbed subalpine wetlands and how environmental drivers influence the undisturbed structure and hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical functions. Knowledge of these natural processes is necessary to ensure appropriate management decisions and future restoration success. This study examines small subalpine wetlands in an elevation range of 2256-2316 m located in southwest Montana. Study sites include two wetland types, in undisturbed and restored conditions. This research examines physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological attributes of wetlands in varying conditions, to define and compare wetland characteristics, determine primary environmental drivers of wetland ecological and biogeochemical functions, and compare response to human perturbation. Comparisons of our data indicate significant differences in all categories of parameters, and include metrics of biodiversity, primary productivity, hydrologic regime, and physical and chemical properties of the soil. Several environmental drivers are identified, with the primary driver of vegetation and redox response variables being depth to water and persistence of saturated conditions. The depressional wetland type is characterized by a distinct hydrologic regime, with these conditions being significantly related to a greater number of ecological and biogeochemical functions than the linear wetland type. Restoration data indicate that the restoration methods employed are sufficient in establishing the primary wetland characteristics used in wetland definition. However, the trajectory of restored wetlands indicates that long term recovery may result in wetlands exhibiting different structural and functional attributes than intended.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/heikes-knapton/Heikes-KnaptonS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fish eating behavior and stages of change in rural, low income women of childbearing age</field><field name="creator">Heineman, Sara Christine</field><field name="description">Methyl Mercury (MeHg) is a known neurotoxin associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in children. The primary route of exposure of MeHg in humans is from consumption of contaminated fish. Although some disparities in exposure patterns have been identified, little is known about rural, low income, women of childbearing age and their fish eating behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between stages of behavioral change in fish eating behavior and self-reported consumption of fish among 106 rural low-income women of childbearing age. Results of the one-way ANOVA do not show a statistically significant difference in fish consumption within the sample based on stage of change. However, many of the participants of this study may be at risk for significant exposures to MeHg based on total fish consumption regardless of their decision to limit fish consumption. Further investigation is needed to determine types and sources of fish being consumed and fully understand exposure risks.

However, while their scripts may call for activism, their expository, realistic style, with hidden production methods, an authoritative tone, and pristine visuals, instead encourages voyeurism. In addition, standard theater and television distribution methods offer no outlet for action to viewers who do feel inspired. I offer a different model for influence in my wildlife series Nature Break: reflexive filmmaking. In this series I use such reflexive strategies to critique the voyeuristic way in which spectators consume wildlife and nature films. However, critiquing passive spectators with reflexivity is not the same as creating active spectators. Therefore, with Nature Break I go beyond simply making and distributing a film. Additionally, I will create a related website on the Internet as a platform for viewers to post their own films, discuss issues inspired by films on the site, and coordinate activism efforts. Through Internet distribution, the Nature Break series can finally live up to the reflexive filmmaker's goal of creating an art that leads to activism.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/hiemenz/HiemenzV0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensing the sacred: designing an interfaith center for Bozeman, Montana</field><field name="creator">Hohmann, Justina</field><field name="description">Designing sacred space is not a simple undertaking. Throughout the process one must attempt to understand religious beliefs and needs, often beyond one's own belief system, and translate intangible ideas into practical architectural realities. Designing interfaith sacred space becomes an infinitely more complex problem, complete with conflicting beliefs, values, and architectural practices. Rectifying countless sets of opposing ideas within an architectural space becomes a challenge that few architects have attempted thus far. Yet the value of interfaith sacred space in today's society is enormous because we live in an interfaith world - one striving to achieve peace amidst crisis, conflict, and the "busyness" of everyday life. Interfaith sacred space is more than a room where people of different faiths gather and share. It can provide the opportunity for individuals to step out of the intensity of the profane into the quietude of the sacred and connect with their inner peace and strength. How does one design a space that can be recognized as sacred to people of multiple religious traditions when those traditions struggle to agree on the basic nature of a higher power, let alone icons, ideologies, and doctrines? Perhaps a common ground exists beyond the realm of religious doctrine. All of humanity, regardless of religious orientation, shares in experiencing life through the five senses. Often spiritual experiences are paired with events that emphasize one or a few of those senses. In fact, religious traditions make use of this connection between the senses and the sacred in order to heighten the spiritual encounters of their followers. Furthermore, individuals that do not even claim to be religious will often equate a spiritual event in their life with a certain awareness of one or more of their senses. Often these experiences, either individual or shared amongst a community, will bring about a sense of peace and tranquility. By engaging the five senses through architectural features that peacefully trigger and place emphasis upon these senses, people of any religious tradition are invited to participate and share as individuals and communities in spiritual experiences in these troubled times.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/hohmann/HohmannJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a test protocol for cyclic pullout of geosynthetics in roadway base reinforcement</field><field name="creator">Holley, Timothy Michael</field><field name="description">Geosynthetics, or manmade materials used in soils engineering, have successfully been used as base reinforcement of pavements for over 40 years. Use of geosynthetics can result in cost savings by allowing the aggregate base layer to be reduced in thickness and/or the service life of the pavement to be extended. Design methods for this type of reinforcement have typically been developed by individual manufacturers for specific products. These methods are not widely used by state transportation agencies because 1) they are proprietary, 2) they are empirically based, and 3) they lack compatibility with the current national trend towards mechanistic-empirical pavement design procedures. This project was initiated to develop testing methods to determine one of the critical material properties needed for mechanistic-empirical base-reinforced pavement design, namely, the resilient interface shear stiffness. This property describes the interaction, in particular the shear stiffness, between the geosynthetic and the surrounding aggregate. This new test protocol closely mimics vehicular load patterns, resulting in design parameters pertinent to the use of the geosynthetics to reinforce the base course. A study was conducted to evaluate the repeatability of these tests and to develop a standardized test method. Specific parameters under investigation include load pulse and rest period duration, embedment length of the geosynthetic, and differences in results using different soils and types of geosynthetics. Some parameters seemed to have little effect on values of resilient interface shear stiffness, while others vastly impacted the results. Load pulse and rest period durations did not affect output results significantly. Maintaining a constant confinement or shear stress during the test duration produced higher repeatability and correlated well to the adapted resilient modulus equation. Three-aperture length tests on polyester geogrid also correlated well with this equation, however repeatability was moderately low. Polypropylene geogrid and a woven geotextile confined in Ottawa sand displayed low correlation to this equation. During testing, very small displacements occur, and therefore, every effort should be made to ensure that these measurements are accurate and not skewed by electrical noise and interference.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/holley/HolleyT0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the effects of the implementation of small peer led collaborative group learning on students in developmental mathematics courses at a tribal community college</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Dianna Dawn Tiahrt</field><field name="description">College students needing remediation in mathematics are a problem at nearly all colleges and universities but are immense at community colleges where large numbers of students enroll in developmental mathematics courses. This issue for Native American students at Tribal Community Colleges has an enormous effect on future opportunities in education, employment, politics and society. The overarching research question was: How does the implementation of small peer-led collaborative learning groups affect students in developmental mathematics courses at the Tribal Community College? To answer this question five sub-questions were addressed. What impact will the treatment have on: 1) completion, 2) perseverance, 3) demonstrated procedures of mathematics, 3) personal skills for success, and 4) the leaders' perceptions of the benefits associated with acting as small peer led collaborative group leader? This research study took place at a small Tribal Community College. The quasi-experimental, mixed methods study involved collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The treatment class consisted of having the students work together on a workshop activity designed to be engaging, challenging and relevant for one class period each week in small peer-led collaborative learning groups. Peer leaders were chosen according to predetermined criteria. The peer leaders were trained to help guide the group in the direction of a solution and to help the group learn how to collaborate to achieve the best results. The control class was given the same workshop activity to work on, but not encouraged to work together nor assisted by a peer leader. Results of this research study show increased completion and perseverance rates. Students participating in the small peer-led collaborative groups were more likely to attempt mathematics. The attitude toward mathematics was the most drastic change; students now look forward to attending their mathematics class and spend more time out of class doing mathematics. Group leaders gained personal, academic and leadership skills. Detailed descriptions of the results are given. In conclusion, implications of the findings and how they may be used are provided for mathematics instructors, administrators and student support personnel are offered. Recommendations for further research are also suggested.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/hooker/HookerD1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnetic resonance microscopy studies of biofilms: diffusion, hydrodynamics and porous media</field><field name="creator">Hornemann, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">Due to the complicated nature of studying living bacterial communities, Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) is a necessary tool providing unique data that is complementary to other techniques such as confocal microscopy and microelectrodes. MRM has the ability to probe an opaque system non-invasively and collect velocity measurements, imaging data, diffusion, and relaxation values and is an asset in the quest to learn how biofilms establish, grow, and die. The goal of these studies was to extend current biofilm research using MRM to enhance our understanding of transport phenomena over a hierarchy of scales, from the microscopic diffusion level to the macroscopic bulk flow. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the bacteria chosen for the biopolymer diffusion and the secondary flow studies due to its common identification in opportunistic biofilm infections. This diffusion study was the first Pulse Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) MRM measurements of the impact of environmental and chemical challenges on the biomacromolecular dynamics in medically relevant S. epidermidis biofilm material demonstrating the ability to characterize molecular dynamics in biofilms, providing a basis for sensors which can indicate the state of the biofilm after thermal or chemical treatment and provide information to further understand the molecular level mechanisms of such treatments. The secondary flow data clearly support the conclusion that reactor size impacts studies of spatially distributed biological activity, and the idea that, scaling of transport models in biofilm impacted devices is possible but requires more study. Additionally, due to the increasing amount of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere and the need to understand the options of sequestering this CO2 to combat the impacts of global warming, studies were conducted to understand how biofilms grow in porous media. The resilience of Bacillus mojavensis biofilms to super critical CO2 is documented, and thus, this bacteria was chosen. Results indicate that by varying exchange times, T2-T2 experiments can determine the extent of biofilm growth in an opaque porous media as demonstrated in multiple glass bead pack configurations. Using MRM as a tool to study these biofilm systems over a wide range of environmental conditions is the focus of the research presented in this dissertation.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/hornemann/HornemannJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative prediction of dye fluorescence quantum yields in proteins</field><field name="creator">Hutcheson, Ryan Mitchell</field><field name="description">The application of a method previously developed by Callis et al. to predict the quantum yields of Trp fluorescence has been successfully applied to the fluorescence of fluorescein and flavins in proteins.

This is evident by the comparison of the fractional deviation of the interaction, density of states and the rate. Here the fluctuations in the density of states is an order of magnitude larger than the fluctuations in the interactions and is nearly the same as that of the kET fluctuations.

Since the concept of limit in introductory calculus usually concerns a process applied to a single function, it seems reasonable to believe that a robust understanding of function is beneficial to and perhaps necessary for a meaningful understanding of limit. Therefore, the main goal of this dissertation is to quantitatively correlate students' understanding of function and their understanding of limit. In particular, the correlation between the two is examined in the context of an introductory calculus course for future scientists and engineers at a public, land grant research university in the west. In order to measure the strength of the correlation between understanding of function and understanding of limit, two tests-the Precalculus Concept Assessment (PCA) to measure function understanding and the Limit Understanding Assessment (LUA) to measure limit understanding-were administered to students in all sections of the aforementioned introductory calculus course in the fall of 2008. A linear regression which included appropriate covariates was utilized in which students' scores on the PCA were correlated with their scores on the LUA. Nonparametric bivariate correlations between students' PCA scores and students' scores on particular subcategories of limit understanding measured by the LUA were also calculated. Moreover, a descriptive profile of students' understanding of limit was created which included possible explanations as to why students responded to LUA items the way they did. There was a strong positive linear correlation between PCA and LUA scores, and this correlation was highly significant (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the nonparametric correlations between PCA scores and LUA subcategory scores were all statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). The descriptive profile of what the typical student understands about limit in each LUA subcategory supplied valuable context in which to interpret the quantitative results. Based on these results, it is concluded that understanding of function is a significant predictor of future understanding of limit. Recommendations for practicing mathematics educators and indications for future research are provided.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/jensen/JensenT.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatiotemporal relationship between climate and Whitebark pine mortality in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem</field><field name="creator">Jewett, Jeffrey Thomas</field><field name="description">Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) serves as a subalpine keystone species by regulating snowmelt runoff, reducing soil erosion, facilitating the growth of other plants, and providing food for wildlife, particularly grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis). Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) is an ideal bio-indicator of climate change, as its life cycle is entirely temperature dependent. Western North America is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of mountain pine beetle on record, and evidence suggests that a changing climate has accelerated the life-cycle of this bark beetle, allowing it to expand into new habitat. This study explored the relationships between climate, mountain pine beetles, and whitebark pine mortality in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). A time-series of Landsat satellite imagery was used to monitor whitebark pine mortality in the GYE from 1999 to 2008. The patterns of mortality were analyzed with respect to monthly climate (temperature and precipitation) variations over the 9-year period. The impacts of topography and autocorrelation (both spatial and temporal) were also analyzed with respect to whitebark pine mortality. Whitebark pine mortality was assessed using the Enhanced Wetness Difference Index (EWDI), a Landsat-derived measure of canopy moisture. Regression tree models were built to predict yearly changes in EWDI. Thirty-eight percent of the deviance in whitebark pine was explained by a regression tree with 10 predictor variables. The most important predictor variables were autocorrelation terms, indicating a strong host-tree depletion effect, where mountain pine beetles were much less likely to attack recently attacked areas. Topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect) were not useful in predicting whitebark pine mortality. Climate variables alone were used to construct a regression tree with 14 predictor variables which predicted 15% of the dataset deviance in whitebark pine mortality. Drier climatic conditions favored increased whitebark pine mortality, likely due to the decreased ability of whitebark pine to repel beetle attacks. Warmer climatic conditions also favored increased whitebark pine mortality, likely due to a decrease in winter mortality of mountain pine beetle. These results show for the first time a statistical link between climate variability and whitebark pine mortality, likely mediated by mountain pine beetles.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/jewett/JewettJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reworking Myth: casting lots for the future of library workplaces</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Joshua Kevin</field><field name="description">The purpose of this work is to provide understanding regarding the future of library workplaces by, first, establishing the relationship between Joseph Campbell's functions of mythology in traditional cultures and workplace texts, and then showing libraries as workplaces with such texts.

However, most riparian zones have been significantly modified by human activities. It is important to identify relationships between riparian birds and characteristics of the environment to understand the potential influences of floodplain management on birds. I examined patterns of riparian bird species distribution, as well as the factors affecting occurrence and abundance of species along the Yellowstone River in Montana. Point counts were conducted and vegetation data collected at 234 locations along 725 kilometers of the river. Occupancy or linear regression models were used to estimate occurrence or abundance of 14 bird species. First, I examined patterns in the distribution of bird species and their habitats. A gradient exists along most rivers that represents downstream changes in environmental conditions; I expected the distribution of vegetation to reflect this gradient, and birds to respond to these changing habitat conditions. Mature cottonwood habitat types were identified using cluster analysis, and habitat was an important driver of bird occurrence and abundance. However, there was little evidence that habitats were organized along a downstream gradient. River location was very important to birds, even after accounting for the influence of habitat, suggesting that the distributions of bird species are related to gradients that are not always reflected by habitat. Second, I used model selection methods to investigate the influences of local habitat, forest cover, land use, and river location on the occurrence or abundance of bird species. There was strong evidence that these factors were important drivers of bird distribution, and the relative influences of each factor depended upon life history characteristics of each species. The effect of river location on the occurrence or abundance of species suggests that broad-scale influences are important predictors of bird distribution along rivers. River location may reflect unmeasured environmental resources (e.g. food) that are important to birds, or variation in a species' distribution within its range boundaries. The Yellowstone River may serve as a reference for understanding the factors influencing the distribution of birds along a river, and provide valuable information for the management of riparian species.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/jones/JonesD0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'We on history channel!': the representation of history in documentary film</field><field name="creator">Jones, Rex Allan</field><field name="description">The representation of history in documentary film is problematic.

Ever since the dawn of photography, artists have manipulated images and compromised facticity in service to aesthetics and drama. This trend continued into the early days of cinema, as newsreel producers adopted a more liberal than literal ethos that persists in documentary to this day. Reality can never be shown just as it is even in the most simplistic treatments of the most banal subjects. The representation of history is not always as absolute as it may seem. Instead of ignoring or denying the authorship inherent in the representation of history in documentary film, filmmakers should embrace it and reflexively provide glimpses of the cinematic process that forms their particular construction of reality. I will argue that the best way to accomplish this goal is to employ the performative mode of documentary representation, which gives the viewer a context to think about the film as a version of history, not necessarily the version of it.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/jones/JonesRA0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science teaching time and practice, and factors influencing elementary teachers' decisions about both in rural, reservation schools</field><field name="creator">Jones, Richard Marshall</field><field name="description">An achievement gap exists between White and Native American students in Montana. Extensive research has shown that improving the quality of instruction for minority students is an effective way to narrow this gap. Science education reform movements emphasize that for science to be effective it must first be taught and that when taught, should use a variety of approaches, including inquiry. In Montana it is also essential that programs designed to improve science instruction include strategies recommended by the research that are effective for Native American students including contextualization within the culture, the use of modeling and demonstration, and collaborative engagement in learning. The ten teachers who participated in this study were engaged in such a program, the Big Sky Science Partnership (BSSP). This study investigates three questions. First, how much time are the teachers in the study teaching science? Second, what does this teaching look like in relation to the recommendations for best science practice found in the research? Third, what influences do the teachers feel drive their instructional decisions? The answers to these questions were based on both quantitative and qualitative measures including data from interviews, participant reflections, observations, and surveys. This study provides an in-depth description of the allocation of science teaching time for elementary teachers who work primarily with Native American students as well as providing valuable data regarding teaching practice. The study shows that both time and practice are influenced by many factors. The primary influence cited by the participants in this study was district focus on reading and mathematics instruction. Participants also indicated that their participation in the BSSP had a direct influence on the amount of time they devoted to science instruction as well as the content covered and the strategies used. Teachers' views about these influences provide insight into limitations that schools' physical structure, policy mandates, and culture can place on a teacher's ability to effectively teach science. In light of the results of the study, implications for educators and policy makers are addressed, and recommendations for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/jones/JonesRM0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The grid overlay system model</field><field name="creator">Junkert, Levi Daniel</field><field name="description">The grid overlay system model is a new technique for forming a grid computing model for research computing. In this method we construct a grid that is dynamically allocated from a set of resources in a unique and progressive manner. This new system model allows for construction of virtual environments for execution of applications on many diverse shared resources. The system can dynamically scale to create a range of resources from a single machine to a virtual cluster of machines. This model provides a virtual container that can run legacy and customized software in an emulated environment or directly on the host's hardware through virtualization. Using this model on current consumer hardware allows for a unique blend of software containment with dynamic resource allocation. Our model, in combination with commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware and software, is able to create a large grid system with multiple combinations of hardware and software environments. In our model we propose a unique set of abstraction layers for systems. The combination of our model with current consumer hardware and software provides a unique design principle for addressing grid implementation, hardware reusability, operating system deployment and implementation, virtualization in the grid, and user control techniques. This provides a robust and simple framework that allows for the construction of computational research solutions in which performance can be traded for flexibility, and vice versa. Our model can be applied to computational research grids, service oriented grids, and even scales to collections of mobile or embedded system grids.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/junkert/JunkertL0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions of pneomococcal virulence factors to secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae infection following influenza infection</field><field name="creator">King, Quinton Oliver</field><field name="description">Influenza infection increases susceptibility to secondary infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae resulting in significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Whereas viral contributions to this synergism have been explored, little is known concerning contributions of the bacterium, specifically those provided through bacterial virulence factors. To assess the contributions of the known pneumococcal virulence factors hyaluronidase (Hyl), neuraminidase (NanA) and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) to secondary S. pneumoniae infection following influenza infection, mutants lacking these proteins were administered with wildtype pneumococci in a competitive growth model. Whereas mutants lacking the Hyl and NanA proteins did not exhibit attenuation, mutants lacking PspA were severely attenuated in mice without influenza infection and significantly more so in mice with a prior influenza infection. Additionally, mice received intranasal immunization with recombinant PspA protein and subsequently received primary and secondary challenges with serotypes 2, 3 and 4 pneumococci. Immunization with PspA significantly reduced bacterial burdens of all three challenge serotypes in primary and secondary pneumococcal infection and significantly reduced lung damage markers in mice receiving secondary pneumococcal challenges. In addition to known virulence factors, two surface-exposed proteins, Spr0075 and Spr1345, were assessed for virulence contributions to primary and secondary pneumococcal infections. Mutants lacking Spr0075 or Spr1345 were found to be severely attenuated in both primary and secondary pneumococcal challenges. Whereas immunization with either recombinant Spr0075 or Spr1345 significantly reduced primary pneumococcal burdens, only immunization with Spr0075 significantly reduced secondary pneumococcal burdens. Together these results indicate virulence contributions to both primary and secondary pneumococcal challenges for the PspA, Spr0075 and Spr1345 proteins. However, whereas immunization with PspA and Spr0075 significantly reduced both primary and secondary pneumococcal burdens, immunization with Spr1345 did not significantly impact secondary pneumococcal burdens. This result illustrates that a virulence contribution and/or an ability to protect against primary infection does not necessarily translate into a protein's capacity to protect against secondary infection. The results presented here are the first experimental evidence demonstrating virulence roles for the Spr0075 and Spr1345 proteins and are the first reports of immunization with pneumococcal proteins, specifically PspA and Spr0075, providing protection against secondary pneumococcal infection following influenza.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/king/KingQ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses' knowledge of heart failure education guidelines in a Western Montana hospital</field><field name="creator">Knopp, Anna Marie</field><field name="description">Heart failure (HF) is an epidemic. Five million people were diagnosed with the disease in 2006 and 550,000 new cases are being reported each year. HF is associated with a decreased quality of life and high mortality rate. It also accounts for 12-15 million office visits and 6.5 million hospital stays each year. Although there is no known cure for HF, understanding the disease and guidelines put forth by the American Heart Association as well as the Heart Failure Society of America, has been shown to decrease mortality, increase quality of life, and decrease hospital admissions. Healthcare workers play a vital role in educating HF patients about the disease, and as such, they themselves should be knowledgeable about what they teach. This study seeks to describe nurses' knowledge of the HF education guidelines in a western Montana hospital. A questionnaire was sent to 196 nurses working in a western Montana hospital testing their knowledge regarding the HF education guidelines. Only one nurse answered all questions correctly. The lowest score attained was 25% and the average score for the entire group was 72%. Demographic data explored was area worked (critical care versus non-critical care), years of experience, and educational preparation. The results of this study demonstrated that nurses working in a western Montana hospital may not be sufficiently knowledgeable regarding the HF education guidelines. Increased education may better prepare nurses to educate patients regarding the HF education guidelines. HF patients who are taught by educated nurses may receive a higher quality of education in which, perhaps, the patients will have a better understanding of their disease and the guidelines to increase quality of life and decrease mortality and hospital admissions rates.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/knopp/KnoppA0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing rural nurses' attitudes and beliefs towards evidenced based practice</field><field name="creator">Koessl, Brenda Dawn</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to explore factors that influence rural nurses' attitudes and beliefs towards evidence-based practice by answering the following questions: Do rural nurses find research easy to understand? Do rural nurses believe the results of the research that they read? Does number of years of experience as a nurse affect rural nurses' attitudes and beliefs about research? Does level of education influence rural nurses attitudes and beliefs toward research? Does the size of facility that a rural nurse works in affect attitudes and beliefs toward research? Does the role of a rural nurse within his or her facility affect attitudes and beliefs towards research? This study was a secondary analysis of survey data collected from rural nurses practicing in Oregon, Montana, and South Dakota. Demographic information and responses to survey questions related to attitudes and beliefs provided from 224 nurses were examined to achieve the aims of this study. Regardless of experience or role, most respondents indicated they were proficient in evaluating research, but over half of the respondents were unsure if they believed the results of the research that they read. Nurses with 1-5 years of experience, those with master's preparation, and nurse practitioners had the best attitudes towards research while nurses with greater than 20 years and charge nurses had the worst. There were no appreciated differences in attitudes between diploma, associate degree, and baccalaureate prepared. Given that nurses constitute the largest group of health care providers and their care influences patient outcomes, the pressure on the nursing profession to strengthen the importance of evidence-based practice for all registered nurses is crucial. Further research is needed to explore the role that education, and role have in determining a rural nurse's attitudes and beliefs towards EBP.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/koessl/KoesslB0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical reflection and teacher capacity: the secondary science pre-service teacher population</field><field name="creator">Krim, Jessica Sarah</field><field name="description">This qualitative study seeks to understand the development of secondary science pre-service teachers. A case study is developed about each of the five participants, in effort to answer the research questions, which are: How did critical reflection inform teacher capacity within the secondary science pre-service teacher population? What knowledge, skills, and dispositions facilitated secondary science pre-service teachers in developing a critically reflective practice? It is the author's expectation that by teaching these pre-service educators to develop their skills of critical reflection by using external methods of assessment such as videotaping, peer feedback, and student work, the participants in this study will increase and expand their capacity as teachers, or their "innate potential for growth, development, and accomplishment" (McDiarmid &amp; Clevenger-Bright, 2008), and be better prepared to accomplish the goals that are expected of a master teacher. Data is collected from interviews, participant work samples, and observations from the researcher and other key individuals who worked with each participant, such as: the methods instructor, university supervisors, and cooperating teachers. Over the course of two semesters, the researcher developed a detailed description of each of the participants through analyzing passages selected from interview transcripts and student work samples for reflection type, factor of teacher capacity, and commonplace interaction group. The first outcome of this study includes an understanding of the relationship between critical reflection and teacher capacity and the knowledge, skills and dispositions that facilitate the development of a critically reflective practice. The second outcome of this study was the development of a new adaptation of a teacher interaction model (commonplace interaction groups) based on Schwab's Commonplaces of Educating. Lastly, three conclusions were drawn about the five participants in this study: There was a change in the participants' reflection level from the methods semester to the student teaching semester, most shifted their focus of reflection from teacher-self to teacher-student, and the weakest area of reflection with all participants was content / subject area and curriculum / standards.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/krim/KrimJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuum structural representation of flexure and tension stiffened one-dimensional spacecraft architectures</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Jeffrey James</field><field name="description">Spacecraft designs are a result of system properties and design variables that ensure the spacecraft will operate to mission objectives. The focus of this effort is a set of global system variables for frequency, length, total mass and the ratio between the payload mass and the support structure mass. These properties will be explored to observe the behavior of the system and develop relationships that govern the trade-offs between the variables and assist mission planners in future spacecraft design. These variables will be observed in one-dimensional structures where the dominating dimension is many times larger than the other two dimensions and the system is comprised of a support and a payload member. To observe the interaction between the payload and the support, the system was varied for different system variables and observed through ABAQUS finite element software. Attempts were made to predict the system frequency through mathematical approaches. The finite element work was able to generate several approximate relationships between the system variables and the fundamental natural frequency of the system. From these relationships an approximate equation was developed for the frequency for a fixed mass ratio and load ratio as a function of the length, bending stiffness, and total mass of the system. Additional work into the changes to the system as the number of connect points is increased shows the system converging towards a frequency solution which results in a minimized dependence on the connection points. These results were then compared to those of several derived analytical models to determine if a closed-form solution could be used to predict system behavior over the same range of structural characteristics. This closed form solution proved to correlate well to analytical predictions only for the case where the support structure dominates the total system mass, and thus the structural system performs like a beam under compression. Further work is necessary to accurately predict the system frequency through an analytical approach. These insights promise to aid mission designers in objectively evaluating new structural architectures based on structural performance rather than on an unbalanced adherence to heritage or in some cases personal preference.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/larsen/LarsenJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the potential of protein cages as MRI contrast agents with an emphasis on protein cage characterization by mass spectrometry techniques</field><field name="creator">Liepold, Lars Otto</field><field name="description">Described here is the development of a protein cages as efficient and potentially relevant MRI contrast agents. Three approaches are outlined to fuse high affinity Gd&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm; chelating moieties to the surfaces of protein cages. In the first approach, a metal binding peptide has been genetically engineered into the subunit of Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) and to the small heat shock protein cage from Methanococcus jannaschii (HSP). The genetic fusion resulted in a 200x binding enhancement of Gd&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm; to CCMV in comparison with wild type CCMV and metal binding functionality was added to the HSP protein cage. In a second approach DOTA-Gd was attached to CCMV by reactions with endogenous lysine residues on the surface of the viral capsids and resulted in r1 = 2,806 at 61 MHz for the 28nm diameter particle. Directed by the results of earlier generations of protein cage based contrast agents a next generation MRI contrast agent was designed. In this work a DTPA-Gd containing polymer was grown in the interior of HSP resulting in T1 particle relaxivities of 4,200mM&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; sec&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; for the 12nm particle. Relaxivity parameters were determined and this analysis suggests that the rotational correlation time of the Gd&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm; chelate has been optimized while the exchange life time of Gd&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm;-bound water is slower than optimal. This synthetic approach holds much promise for the development of future generations of contrast agents. Throughout the evolution of the protein cage based contrast agents there has also been and evolution of our ability to characterize these cages with mass spectrometric techniques. Specifically refined methodologies are presented for QTof characterization of protein cage at the level of amino acids, protein subunits, protein complexes and their cellular expression. Furthermore, correct charge state assignment is crucial to assigning an accurate mass to supramolecular complexes such as protein cages analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Conventional charge state assignment techniques fall short of reliably and unambiguously predicting the correct charge state for many supramolecular complexes. We provide an explanation of the shortcomings of the conventional techniques and have developed a robust charge state assignment method that is applicable to all spectra.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/liepold/LiepoldL1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation, design and validation of a solid oxide fuel cell powered propulsion system for an unmanned aerial vehicle</field><field name="creator">Lindahl, Peter Allan</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a physically-based model for design and optimization of a fuel cell powered electric propulsion system for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

The "detection problem" is particularly challenging for low amplitude signals embedded in "glitchy" instrument noise. It is imperative that we can robustly distinguish between the data being consistent with instrument noise alone, or noise and a weak gravitational wave signal. In response to this challenge we have set out to develop a robust, general purpose approach that can locate and characterize gravitational wave signals, and provided odds that the signal is of cosmic origin. Our approach employs the Markov Chain Monte Carlo family of algorithms to construct a fully Bayesian solution to the challenge - the Parallel Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (PTMCMC) detection algorithm. The PTMCMC detection algorithm establishes which regions of parameter space contain the highest posterior weight, efficiently explores the posterior distribution function of the model parameters, and calculates the marginalized likelihood, or evidence, for the models under consideration. We illustrate our approach using simulated LISA and LIGO-Virgo data.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/littenberg/LittenbergT0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temperal analysis of snowpack strength and stability and environmental determinants on an inclined, forest opening</field><field name="creator">Lutz, Eric Robert</field><field name="description">Avalanche hazard evaluation relies on snowpack stability observations. Because snowpack properties can vary extensively over time and space, estimating slope-scale stability is difficult. This study addressed these challenges by implementing a methodology that 1. quantified spatial and temporal patterns of snowpack stability, 2. identified spatial associations between the strength and stability of a weak layer and slab load, and radiation properties, 3. identified internal associations between weak layer thickness, shear strength, microstructural properties, and slab load. An instability associated with a buried surface hoar weak layer was examined on an inclined forest opening at Lionhead, southwest Montana, during February and March, 2005. During five sampling days, 824 snow depth and SnowMicroPen resistance profiles and 352 shear frame tests were performed. An objective texture-based stratigraphic sampling approach was developed to obtain microstructural estimates of a stratigraphic weakness and instability from SnowMicroPen profiles, utilizing the coefficient of variation of rupture force. Spatial models of hemispheric sky visibility, and incoming long- and shortwave radiation were generated for the surface hoar formation period using a Geographic Information System and independent optical observations. Despite relative topographic uniformity, in a distance of 30 m, the buried surface hoar weak layer thicknesses varied between 3 - 21 mm. Before burial, the surface hoar persisted despite moderate winds and above freezing air temperatures. Spatial patterns of modeled incoming longwave and shortwave radiation explained the large variation in weak layer thickness and strength properties. Areas exposed to large amounts of radiation contained a strong, thin buried surface hoar layer, while in areas with limited incoming longwave (due to high sky visibility) and shortwave radiation (due to shading), the layer was thicker and possessed low shear and microstructural strengths. Over time, the shear frame stability index and SnowMicroPen-derived microstrength of the surface hoar layer increased and values became spatially more variable (divergence): it became harder to predict stability as the snowpack became more stable. A loading event then decreased stability and micro-strength and caused spatial uniformity (convergence), thereby increasing predictive strength of observations. The findings illustrate the usefulness of the SnowMicroPen for evaluating spatial patterns and load-related changes in snowpack stability.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/lutz/LutzE0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loneliness as experienced by women living with chronic illness in rural areas</field><field name="creator">Marcille, Lisa Ann</field><field name="description">Chronic illness is often accompanied by multiple life altering challenges for individuals especially those living in rural locations. Rural dwellers generally do not have readily accessible healthcare resources; as a result, there is a risk for poor heath related outcomes. Loneliness is one such outcome. The purpose of this study was to contribute to the existing body of knowledge related to loneliness as experienced by women living with chronic illnesses in rural areas. This was accomplished by identifying and exploring factors related to loneliness. The aims of this study were to: (a) to describe the levels of loneliness, depression, stress, and social support for a group of rural women with a chronic illness; (b) identify the factors associated with loneliness; and (c) explore participants' shared conversations to gain further insight into the rural chronically-ill woman's experience of loneliness. This study was conducted as a secondary analysis of data previously collected by the Women to Women (WTW) research team at Montana State University. The WTW study provided rural women with chronic illnesses computer training and support through an online forum. The data for the secondary analysis were generated by 57 women. The key concepts were: loneliness, depression, stress, and social support. Age, education, degree of rurality, employment status, and length of chronic illness were the demographic characteristics of interest. Degree of rurality was assigned using the MSU Rurality Index. These characteristics and the key concepts were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analytic techniques. Content analysis was the method used to analyze the women's conversations in the online forum. The data were obtained from 12 women who were identified as the most vulnerable to loneliness. Three categories were defined using this method: longing for loved ones, "listening" from the background, and changing relationships. Results of this study supported previous researchers' findings of correlations between loneliness and depression, social support and stress. There was no significant relationship between loneliness and degree of rurality; however, length of chronic illness was significant. Level of education was identified as an area of interest for further nursing research.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/marcille/MarcilleL0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergence and growth of seven grass species across a gradient of metals and arsenic in lime-amended contaminated soils</field><field name="creator">Martin, Tara Noel</field><field name="description">Montana's Upper Clark Fork River Basin contains hundreds of square kilometers of land impacted by mine wastes and/or smelter emissions from decades of copper mining and related activities. Contaminated soils in the Basin are often acidic and highly enriched with the trace elements cadmium, copper, arsenic, lead, zinc, and others. Natural plant colonization is often impaired, as evidenced by barren areas that are so phytotoxic that normal germination and establishment cannot occur. One reclamation strategy being used is in-place treatment with soil amendments including lime and other products. This provides a more hospitable substrate for plants by raising pH and lowering the mobile and bioavailable fraction of metals. Since contaminants are not removed with in-place treatment, short-term and long-term effectiveness of the soil amendments and the vegetative cover continue to be debated. Several experimental plots within the Basin have been treated in-place, but have developed plant communities of limited diversity where some seeded species failed to establish or persist. A greenhouse pot study was used to determine site-specific toxicity thresholds across a dilution of total metals and arsenic that significantly reduced plant growth. Two sets of contaminated and reference soils collected from the Basin were mixed to obtain metal and arsenic concentration gradients from 244 to 5885 and 250 to 7521 mg/kg, respectively. Five native and two non-native grasses were grown in separate trials. Percent emergence, shoot height, total biomass and root mass ratio were analyzed. Sensitivity of the seven grasses varied according to the response measured and dilution series. Most species showed significant reductions in total biomass and shoot height when the sum of total metals and arsenic was 559 to 1900 mg/kg. Redtop (Agrostis gigantea Roth) was the most tolerant species, not displaying significant decreases in total biomass until the sum of total metals and arsenic reached 5783 mg/kg. Because the study used contaminated environmental samples and nonagricultural species, the results may better estimate site-specific ecological risk and toxicity thresholds for in-place treated soils in the UCFRB over studies performed in sand with inappropriate surrogate species.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/martin/MartinT0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Never wash away: a case study of video-centered outreach in the Republic of Congo</field><field name="creator">Matheson, Kelly Ann</field><field name="description">Since its inception, documentary film has been thought to be an effective way to galvanize social change.

However, very few studies have examined this phenomenon in preschool-age children. Furthermore, prior methodology used to investigate this topic has been criticized for its unrealistic nature. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine body size awareness, stereotypes, friendship selection, and self-preferences of 3 to 5 year-old children, using improved methodology. The first improvement made to this study was the replacement of materials used in the past, with new stimuli: photographs of real children. These photographs were digitally altered to obtain three different body sizes (thin, average and overweight), while controlling for facial attractiveness. The intent of using photographs of real children rather than hand-made figures was to increase the realistic quality of the stimuli. Additionally, photographs of boys and girls were used to assess same- and cross-gender judgments of body size. For each item, children were asked to hand the selected target figure to the experimenter to decrease ambiguity about participant choices. Results showed that body size awareness increases as a function of age. Anti-fat bias was present in children as young as 3 years also increased as a function of age. Children were less likely to ascribe positive traits (e.g., "nicest" and "cutest") to the overweight target compared to either the thin or average sized targets. Similarly, children were more likely to assign negative adjectives (e.g., "stupidest" and "ugliest") to and prefer not to play with or look like the overweight targets relative to thin and average size targets. These results necessitate the implementation of body-size-acceptance-based programs in preschool and daycare facilities to reduce body-size-based stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination at an early age.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/may-fraser/May-FraserL0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isostatically compensated extensional tectonics on Enceladus</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Scott Stuart</field><field name="description">Saturn's moon Enceladus is the smallest body in the solar system known to be geologically active. Extensive, energetic resurfacing processes are ongoing and it possesses a system of geysers at the South Pole that supply material to the E-ring. The South Polar Terrain (SPT) is the youngest region on Enceladus and its contacts with the older cratered and grooved plains to the north are delineated by a variety of complex geologic features including mountain ranges and massive grabens. Many of the geologic features seen on Enceladus bear superficial resemblance to terrestrial structures associated with plate tectonics. A detailed structural geologic analysis, supported by crater counting studies, was used to determine whether the features seen on Enceladus are compatible with terrestrial-style plate tectonics. On Earth, new lithosphere is created at spreading centers and consumed at subduction zones, enabled by the compositional dichotomy between oceanic and continental crust. Enceladus's lithosphere appears to be made entirely of pure water ice, so any newly formed crust will have the same composition, but lower density due to higher temperature, making subduction and consequently spreading, as we understand it on Earth, impossible. Geometrically, the absence of fold-thrust belts and transform faults in the presence of normal faults and basin and range-style features implies extension without corresponding shortening elsewhere. This is not possible in a conventional (terrestrial) plate tectonic regime as surface area is not conserved; therefore, an alternate explanation is required. Topographic features associated with density contrasts between old and new terrain that are diagnostic of terrestrial spreading centers are also not observed on Enceladus. I conclude that features observed on Enceladus are inconsistent with terrestrial-style plate tectonic spreading, and represent a style of tectonism peculiar to bodies with icy lithospheres. I present an interpretation in which the cordillera surrounding the SPT is a broadly developed extensional regime, and describe a model for its formation that is consistent with the known physical properties of Enceladus, dependent on the presence of a water-ice phase transition below the south polar terrain.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mcleod/McLeodS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of growing structures on Cretaceous alluvial systems along the Cordilleran thrust belt front, Valley of Fire, Southern Nevada</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Kelsey Caitlin</field><field name="description">Outstanding preservation and exposure of Cretaceous tectogenic deposits in the North Muddy Mountains of southern Nevada provide a rare opportunity to examine the influence of frontal structures on provenance and sediment dispersal to the Cordilleran foreland basin. Eastward migration of the Sevier wedge-top depozone into the contiguous foredeep depozone was facilitated by development of the Willow Tank thrust-cored fault-propagation fold. The resulting thrust-cored frontal ridge diverted pre-existing fluvial systems of the Willow Tank Formation and promoted proximal alluvial fan deposition of the Baseline Formation. The Albian Willow Tank Formation represents the earliest foreland basin sediments derived from large, integrated drainage basins of the thrust belt interior. Sandstone point counts reveal an up-section increase in quartz locally derived from erosion from the Jurassic Aztec Sandstone along the frontal anticlinal ridge in the proximal Willow Tank thrust hanging wall. Continued fold growth is documented by growth strata development in and provenance of the overlying White Member of the Baseline Formation. Conglomeratic clast counts and detailed lithofacies analyses in the Cenomanian Red Member of the Baseline Formation record sequential unroofing of the frontal anticline and interaction of adjacent alluvial fan and fluvial depositional environments, respectively. Clast counts of poorly-sorted, massive ungraded conglomerates indicate a reverse clast stratigraphy based on progressively increasing amounts of carbonate framework clasts up-section. This trend is attributed to exposure and erosion of Upper Paleozoic strata in the Willow Tank hanging-wall anticline. Evidence of interfingering depositional environments is shown by up-section trends including: 1) replacement of poorly-sorted and organized coarse-grained conglomerates by well-sorted stratified to normally-graded conglomerates, 2) an overall decrease in grain size, 3) a decrease in soft-sediment deformation and increase in bioturbation, and 4) an increase in lateral bed continuity. This upsection transformation represents a spatial and temporal transition from foldproximal debris flow-dominated fans to an integrated braided stream system that transported detritus from the same source. Facies examination, clast composition and intertonguing relationships between the Red and Overton Conglomerate Members suggest contiguous braided stream networks that tapped separate, distinct source areas. These observations, as well as structural relationships, imply out-of-sequence movement on the Muddy Mountain thrust.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mcnamara/McNamaraK1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infusion: urban and domestic transformation</field><field name="creator">McQuinn, Dylan Thomas</field><field name="description">The turn of the Century in this country brought with it the introduction and ensuing growth of water-born trade markets, facilitating the establishment of a series of metropolitan hubs scattered along the coastline. The subsequent hundred years has seen a major increase in population within these areas accompanied by an economic shift away from maritime trade. Older ports have been abandoned, leaving behind antiquated urban infrastructure. The subsequent dismantling of these vast waterfront industrial areas has provided an opportunity for the reconfiguration of these spaces and the implementation of new urban and landscape strategies. Through a recycling of the existing fabric and introduction of new uses, many cities have revitalized their industrial wastelands and integrated these areas within the existing urban fabric. Other coastal cities have merely overlooked these neglected districts and focused development in their periphery, transforming these former economic focal point into physical and typological barriers.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mcquinn/McQuinnD0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A system for automating identification of biological echoes in NEXRAD level II radar data</field><field name="creator">Mead, Reginald Marshall</field><field name="description">Since its inception in the mid twentieth century, radar ornithology has provided scientists with new tools for studying the behavior of birds, especially with regards to migration. A number of studies have shown that birds can be detected using a wide variety of radar devices. Generally, these studies have focused on small portable radars that typically have a finer resolution than large weather surveillance radars. Recently, however, a number of researchers have presented qualitative evidence suggesting that birds, or at least migration events, can be identified using large broad scale radars such as the WSR-88D used in the NEXRAD weather surveillance system. This is potentially a boon for ornithologists because NEXRAD data covers a large portion of the country, is constantly being produced, is freely available, and is archived back into the early 1990s. A major obstacle is that identifying birds in NEXRAD data currently requires having a trained technician manually inspect a graphically rendered radar sweep. The immense amount of available data makes manual classification of radar echoes infeasible over any practical span of space or time. In this thesis, a system is presented for automating this process using machine learning techniques. This approach begins with classified training data that has been interpreted by experts or collected from direct observations. The data is preprocessed to ensure quality and to emphasize relevant features. A classifier is then trained using this data and cross validation is used to measure performance. The experiments in this thesis compare neural network, na&amp;Atilde;&amp;macr;ve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Empirical evidence is provided showing that this system can achieve classification accuracies in the 80th to 90th percentile.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mead/MeadR1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exogenous ligand effects on S-nitrosohemoglobin formation in reactions of methemoglobin with nitric oxide</field><field name="creator">Mellmann, Lisa Jean</field><field name="description">Blood's function of carrying oxygen to tissues is regulated by physiological oxygen gradients that are coupled to vasoconstriction and vasodilation by nitric oxide bioactivity. However, the mechanism by which local oxygen tension utilizes nitric oxide signaling in order to regulate blood flow remains a major unanswered question in biology. Hemoglobin in red blood cells appears to be an ideal sensor, but lack of knowledge about hemoglobin's chemistry with nitric oxide creates a problem for understanding how hemoglobin induces vasodilation. A central focus of this work was to illuminate complexity and response of nitric oxide interactions with hemoglobin while showing how S-nitrosohemoglobin plays a pivotal role in this response. Electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy were employed to observe reactions of low-spin methemoglobin species with nitric oxide. Models were developed and tested to establish the chemistry involved and the global hierarchy of reactions. De minimis models for all experiments are reported. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra confirmed the formation of low-spin iron species that, upon the addition of nitric oxide, showed a decrease in low-spin methemoglobin species and the formation of nitrosyl hemoblobin with a beta-subunit preference. We report the yield of S-nitrosohemoglobin production in reactions of nitric oxide with various methemoglobins distinguished by axial ligand and iron spin state.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mellmann/MellmannL0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray crystallographic studies of the proteins from sulfolobus spindle-shaped viruses (SSVs)</field><field name="creator">Menon, Smita Kesavankutty</field><field name="description">Viruses populate virtually every ecosystem on the planet. Fuselloviridae are ubiquitous crenarchaeal viruses found in high-temperature acidic hot springs around the world. However, compared to eukaryotic and bacterial viruses, our knowledge of viruses infecting the archaea is limited. Fuselloviral genomes show little similarity to other organisms, generally precluding functional predictions. However, structural studies can reveal distant evolutionary relationships and provide functional insights that are not apparent from the primary amino acid sequence alone. Several such structural studies have already contributed to our understanding of the Sulfolobus Spindle-shaped viruses (Fuselloviridae). Here we report the structure of two proteins, SSV1 F112 and SSVRH D212. Biochemical, proteomic and structural studies of F112 reveal a monomeric intracellular protein that adopts a winged helix DNA binding fold. Continuing these efforts, a second structure was also determined where the overall fold and conservation of active site residues place D212 within the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily. Notably, the structure of F112 contains an intrachain disulfide bond, prompting analysis of cysteine usage in this and other hyperthermophilic viral genomes. The analysis supports a general abundance of disulfide bonds in the intracellular proteins of hyperthermophilic viruses and the evolutionary implications of such distribution are discussed. Here we review and describe our progress towards understanding these viruses at a molecular level.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/menon/MenonS0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanocomposites: a study of theoretical micromechanical behavior using finite element analysis</field><field name="creator">Milliren, Eric Carlton</field><field name="description">Current research in nanotechnology has produced an increasing number of possibilities for advanced materials. Among those materials with potential advanced mechanical properties are fiber-reinforced composite laminates that utilize nanoscale fiber diameters. Through a combination of studying classic micromechanical models and modern computer-aided finite element analysis (FEA), the advantages for utilizing these nanofibers in advanced structural applications, such as space mirror backings, was investigated. The approach for modeling these composite structures was that of a Representative Volume Element (RVE). Using the program ABAQUS/CAE, a RVE was created with the goals of accurately comparing to the shear lag theory, effectively incorporating "interphase" zones that bond the constituents, and demonstrating effects of down-scaling fiber diameter. In this thesis, the progression of the ABAQUS model is thoroughly covered as it developed into a verified model correlating with the shear lag theory. The model produced was capable of utilizing interphase if desired, and was capable of off-axis loading scenarios. A MathCAD program was written in order to employ the published theoretical techniques, which were then compared to the FEA results for verification. The FEA model was found to work well in conjunction with the theory explored using MathCAD, after which the nanofiber FEA model showed some clear advantages over a conventional-sized model, specifically an increase in strength of the composite RVE. Finally, it was determined that the interfacial bonding strength plays a large role in the structure of the interphase zone, and thus the overall strength of the composite.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/milliren/MillirenE0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultra wideband radar antenna design for snow measurement applications</field><field name="creator">Mosy, John Samy</field><field name="description">Creating a high-precision, compact and low cost snow structure and depth sensor has always been the dream of many industries, and yet hard to achieve all together. Snow depth sensors are used in avalanche search and rescue and widely in recreational snow industry, as well as in environmental monitoring systems for snow water equivalence measurements. The use of radar for snow depth measurement is not new and many techniques -such as Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) - have been used but they prove to be costly, bulky, and have relatively low precision. Today with the availability of chip-scale Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) technology, it is possible to create Snow Depth Sensor (SDS) and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) measuring systems in low cost, small size and possibly mobile devices, with very high precision. One problem that remains at the RF (Radio Frequency) end of the UWB technique in measuring snow parameters is the antenna used in transmitting and receiving UWB pulses. UWB pulses are characterized by an instantaneous fractional energy bandwidth greater than about 0.20-0.25. The FCC has allocated spectrum for UWB use in the 3.1-10.6 GHz band and available chipsets generate pulses in the lower 3-6 GHz band. For creating applications that use UWB in measuring snow parameters such as SWE and snow depth, a UWB antenna is required. A successful UWB radar antenna needs to have high gain, linear phase, low dispersion and low Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR), and high directivity throughout the entire band. The antennas are to have physically compact design with high gain, linear phase, low VSWR and high directivity for UWB radar applications in the snow measurements industry. This thesis presents several antenna designs for the 3.1-10.6 GHz UWB band and the 3-6 GHz UWB lower band that have the potential to meet these requirements, and show, through laboratory measurements, modeling and simulations, that the required attributes can be achieved.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mosy/MosyJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of critical micelle concentration of an amphiphilic siderophore</field><field name="creator">Mousseau, Kenneth Scott</field><field name="description">The sodachelins are a group of six amphiphilic siderophores produced by a halophilic bacterium. Amphiphilic siderophores, such as the sodachelins, are important in the solubilization and sequestration of iron related to microbial metabolism and are also unique in their ability to form micelle and vesicular structures. This professional paper describes siderophore importance in iron bioavailability, siderophore chemistry and biological function and a thermodynamic analysis of forces that drive micellization and vesicle formation. A description of experiments conducted to isolate, separate and purify the sodachelins for the purpose of measuring their critical micelle concentration (CMC) follows the review of literature. Initial siderophore isolation was achieved using XAD-2 resin to generate a crude extract. This crude extract was then purified by HPLC, and the measurement of CMC of a single siderophore, sodachelin E, was performed with a tensiomat instrument. Crude separation by XAD resin was proven successful; XAD resin has a strong affinity for siderophores as shown by experiment with the siderophore desferrioxamine B (DFB) as a control. Purification of the crude siderophore extract by only one pass on the HPLC was proven insufficient to generate a single, pure siderophore. At least a second pass on the HPLC is required to remove all contaminants. The protocol developed for CMC analysis is consistent and accurate based on a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) control experiment. An approximate CMC value of 140 micron for sodachelin E was obtained, however, HPLC analysis showed contamination of another sodachelin and possible other organic solutes, indicating that this value may be inaccurate.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mousseau/MousseauK0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A 20,000-yr-old record of vegetation and climate from Lower Red Rock Lake, Centennial Valley, Southwestern Montana</field><field name="creator">Mumma, Stephanie Ann</field><field name="description">A ca. 20,000-yr-old sediment core from Lower Red Rock Lake (LRRL) in the Centennial Valley of southwest Montana was obtained to reconstruct the vegetation, climate, and environmental changes during and following the late-Pinedale Glaciation in the northern Rocky Mountains. The base of core LRRL 06P49 consisted of inorganic silt and clay, deposited when a large glacial lake occupied the eastern Centennial Valley. The glacial lake receded during the late-glacial period when its western outlet stabilized. Prior to 17,000 cal yr BP, high pollen percentages of Juniperus, Poaceae, Asteraceae, and other herbs as well as low pollen accumulation rates suggest cold dry conditions. The sparsely vegetated landscape at LRRL is consistent with paleoclimate model simulations that show southward displacement of the jet stream and a strong glacial anticyclone during the full-glacial period. Between 17,000 and 10,500 cal yr BP, increases in Picea and Abies pollen percentages suggest a shift to subalpine parkland and warmer conditions than before as result of the northward shift of the jet stream and increasing summer insolation. From 10,500 to 7100 cal yr BP, pollen percentages of Picea and Abies decreased and those of xerophytic taxa (e.g., Chenopodiaceae and Pseudotsuga) increased, suggesting development of steppe and open forest. Warmer drier conditions in the early Holocene were likely a response to increased summer insolation and a strengthened Pacific subtropical high-pressure system. From 7100 to 2400 cal yr BP, cooler and moister conditions at LRRL, driven by decreasing summer insolation, led to the expansion of high-elevation conifers, steppe, and wetlands. Increases in Picea and Abies pollen percentages after 2400 cal yr BP indicate further closing of forests at high elevations and even cooler and wetter conditions than before. Examination of the first arrival of Pseudotsuga in pollen records throughout the region shows that its arrival was later at sites on the Atlantic side of the Continental Divide as compared to sites on the Pacific side. The geographic pattern suggests that the Continental Divide posed a topographic or climate barrier in the late-glacial period, delaying the migration of Pseudotsuga menziesii from glacial refugia.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/mumma/MummaS1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advocating for advance directives: guidelines for health care professionals</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Rebecca Cowell</field><field name="description">An advance directive, such as a Living Will or Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, allows a person to give their instructions about future medical care if he or she is unable to participate in decisions due to serious illness or incapacity.

Both the homeless population and the abandoned infrastructure of cities are seen as existent until their place in society has been tapered, suspended or given up on completely. Once the individual or building reaches a point of societal condemnation it is neglected and eventually forgotten, slipped into the archives of non-existence. What once was an element of a functioning whole becomes a void that is commonly overlooked. Many forgotten people within the homeless population and buildings within abandoned infrastructure have an immense amount of potential energy that may be utilized to further their existence as a function of society. At a human level the homeless person flows through the social construct with little more acknowledgement than a shrug of the shoulder and a minor donation. In the built environment resources sit stagnant amongst constantly advancing infrastructure. In both circumstances the subject is left to exist as a non-participating part of a society that does not acknowledge their presence and lacks the mutual interaction that makes the vagrant or abandoned infrastructure an integral part of the social system. The Re-Institute program identifies contributing factors of social exclusion at both human and infrastructural levels. These factors will be counteracted by reversing the primary concepts of social exclusion into a catalyst to solve the issue. The mechanisms used to combat the problems of social exclusion will exist in a sociological, environmental and programmatic realm within the Re-Institute project. Through the architectural and programmatic development of the program, these mechanisms will re-institute neglected resources back into a constructive part of society.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/nesset/NessetT1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ah!</field><field name="creator">Nicklas, Andrew Bliss</field><field name="description">Ah!

FishXing, a common tool for indirectly assessing fish passage, uses fish swimming ability information with one-dimensional culvert hydraulics to predict barrier status of culverts. However, since fish swimming ability data is scarce for many fish species, predictions of a culvert's barrier status can be inaccurate and overly conservative, possibly leading to misclassification or uneconomical design. Additional fish swimming ability research is necessary to strengthen these models. The primary goal of this study was to determine the effects of different swimming ability algorithms on velocity barrier flow rates predicted by one-dimensional culvert hydraulics models. A one-dimensional culvert hydraulics model was created in Visual Basic. This model was designed to mimic FishXing's fish swimming algorithm, or use more complex fish swimming algorithms. Three diverse test culverts were selected to show how varying culvert properties (length, geometry, flow regime, and embedment) influences which fish swimming ability algorithm most affects the predicted velocity barrier flow rate. A "test fish" was designed based upon fish swimming ability literature. Each culvert was subjected to six tests, each testing the sensitivity of a particular fish swimming algorithm. This study determined that for different types of culverts, different components of fish swimming ability algorithms substantially affect the velocity barrier flow rate. The study needed only three test culverts to show that accurate quantification of the fish species' burst speed, burst duration, the burst speed/duration relationship, prolonged swimming speed, and constant deceleration time from burst to prolonged speed is necessary to model diverse fish passage situations. This study also showed that if a fish has a substantial deceleration time, a constant deceleration is probably sufficient to model it. In the future, if programs like FishXing adapt to include deceleration in fish swimming models, constant deceleration is an adequate addition. With this analysis, fish swimming ability variables substantially affecting fish passage were determined. The study can be used to guide further research so swimming ability studies can gather swimming data that is most crucial to predicting fish passage.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/nixon/NixonK0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in temporal leptin concentrations and other metabolic factors in primiparous, postpartum, anestrous, suckled, beef cows exposed to bulls</field><field name="creator">Olsen, Jesse Riley</field><field name="description">Exposing cows to bulls or excretory products of bulls stimulates resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, suckled, anestrous cows. This biostimulatory effect may be mediated by pheromones produced by bulls that stimulate physiological changes in metabolic regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis of cows. In Experiment 1, the hypotheses tested were that concentrations of glucose, NEFA, thyroxine (T4), tri-iodothyronine (T3), and T3:T4 ratios do not differ between cows exposed to bulls or steers. The biostimulatory effect of bulls was associated with lower mean concentrations of NEFA in postpartum cows. Experiment 2 was designed to determine if continuous (24-h daily) bull exposure alters temporal patterns of leptin concentrations in postpartum, anestrous cows. Cows exposed to bulls that resumed cycling activity after the start of the experiment tended to have higher leptin concentrations by the end of the 30-d exposure period than cows not exposed to bulls. However, it was not known if these changes were related to resumption of ovarian cycling activity in postpartum, anestrous cows. Experiment 3 tested the hypothesis that temporal leptin concentrations may depend upon duration of daily bull exposure. Cows had higher daily leptin concentrations and resumed ovarian cycling activity sooner as duration of daily bull exposure increased. In conclusion, as duration of daily bull exposure increases, the biostimulatory effect of bulls alters temporal leptin concentrations and this change may facilitate or support the function of the HPO axis and accelerate resumption of ovarian cycling activity in primiparous, postpartum, suckled, anestrous cows.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/olsen/OlsenJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does being nice have a price?: an investigation of socially responsible funds' performance</field><field name="creator">Omelyukh, Inna Vasylivna</field><field name="description">Are lower returns a cost of socially responsible investing?

The primary function of the unit is to align the pattern trigger pulses of two pulse pattern generators which supply four inputs of a multiplexer.  The pulse pattern generators lack the ability to start their code according to an external signal.  When operating, the designed unit maintains a specific pattern alignment of two binary data streams of 5 gigabits per second as a multiplexer combines them into a data stream of four times the bit rate.  In addition to alignment, the unit can introduce offsets of up to 50 nanoseconds to the pattern alignment which corresponds to 250 bits.  The unit is designed to allow the alignment of other devices as well, requiring as input the two event signals of the same frequency which need to be aligned.  In order to align the devices providing the event pulses, one of the devices must either accept an external clocking source or have the ability to frequency modulate the internal clock.  In practice, the test system was able to achieve and maintain the desired signal characteristics from the output of the multiplexer.  The unit's robust design is shown by providing alignment of patterns for the full operating range of the pulse pattern generators and allowing a generator pattern to be aligned to a generic event pulse.  Use of multiple units allows alignment of additional devices.  The development of the Periodic Event Synchronization Unit provided an inexpensive solution to creating very high bit rate signals using preexisting equipment, as no commercial products were found to accomplish the same function.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/ostrander/OstranderC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrology and landscape structure control subalpine catchment carbon export</field><field name="creator">Pacific, Vincent Jerald</field><field name="description">Carbon export from high elevation ecosystems is a critical component of the global carbon cycle. Ecosystems in northern latitudes have become the focus of much research due to their potential as large sinks of carbon in the atmosphere. However, there exists limited understanding of the controls of carbon export from complex mountain catchments due to strong spatial and temporal hydrologic variability, and large heterogeneity in landscape structure. The research presented in this dissertation investigates the control of hydrology and landscape structure and position on two major avenues of carbon loss from mountain watersheds: soil respiration and stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export. Measurements of soil respiration and its biophysical controls (soil water content, soil temperature, vegetation, soil organic matter, and soil physical properties) and stream and groundwater DOC dynamics are presented across three years and multiple riparian-hillslope transitions within a complex subalpine catchment in the northern Rocky Mountains, Montana. Variability in soil respiration was related to hydrologic dynamics through space and time and was strongly influenced by topography and landscape structure. Cumulative soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux was significantly higher from wet riparian landscape positions compared to drier hillslope locations. Changes in hydrologic regimes (e.g. snowmelt and precipitation timing and magnitude) also impacted soil respiration. From a wet to a dry growing season, there were contrasting and disproportionate changes in cumulative growing season surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux at wet and dry landscape positions. Stream DOC export was also influenced by landscape structure and hydrologic variability. The mobilization and delivery mechanisms of DOC from the soil to the stream were dependent upon the size of DOC source areas and the degree of hydrologic connectivity between the stream and the riparian and hillslope zones, which varied strongly across the landscape. This dissertation provides fundamental insight into the controls of hydrology and landscape structure on carbon export from complex mountain watersheds. The results of this research have large implications for the carbon source/sink status of high elevation mountain ecosystems, the influence of changing hydrologic regimes on soil respiration, and the use of landscape analysis to determine the locations of large source areas for carbon export.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/pacific/PacificV0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smart composites: evaluation of embedded sensors in composite materials</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Nathan Reed</field><field name="description">As an emerging form of renewable energy, horizontal wind turbines have experienced advancements in improving efficiency and reliability. These advances have pushed the limits of current technology used in wind turbines. Smart blades have been proposed as a method of addressing these limitations. Sensor integration within blade construction is the first step in development of smart blades. Thus, several low cost sensors were chosen, 1 axis strain gages, polyvinylidene fluoride films (PVDF), and single mode fiber optics either coated in acrylate or polyimide. To ensure successful bonding between sensor and composite two surface treatment techniques were developed. The first, dipping of the sensor into a bath of 20% by weight solution of nitric acid and the second was submersion of the sensor in the nitric acid for ten seconds prior to removal. These treatments were compared against sensors not surface treated prior to embedding. These sensors were embedded within samples created of fiberglass and epoxy or vinyl ester resin. Two different material tests were conducted. Tensile testing allowed for evaluation of sensor sensitivity, sensor failure point, material tensile modulus, and material tensile strength. Mode I fracture toughness evaluation, indicated the level of successful bonding which occurred during resin curing. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) was conducted to further confirm the level of bonding between resin and sensor, post fracture. Results for embedded strain gages showed an adverse effect for vinyl ester samples. Epoxy samples fared better, thus concluding manufacturing success for epoxy samples, submersion being preferred, and alternative methods needed for vinyl ester samples. PVDF films had good qualitative FESEM images combined with increasing trends. It was concluded that integration for both resin groups with sensors submerged in nitric acid was successful. Fiber optics coated in acrylate also showed good bonding under FESEM imaging as well as testing. It was thus concluded that submersion was the preferred treatment. Lastly, fiber optics coated in polyimide embedded in vinyl ester composites showed significant drawbacks and it was concluded that alternative methods need exploration. Those embedded in epoxy were successfully integrated and submersion in nitric acid showed the most potential.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/palmer/PalmerN0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reductive transformation of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene by Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15 under conditions of different initial pH of the culture medium or in the presence of ferrihydrite</field><field name="creator">Pannier, Andy Joseph</field><field name="description">Batch and column studies were conducted to examine the difference in the transformation pathways of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) reduction by a hemiascomycetous yeast (Yarrowia lipolytica AN-L15) under conditions of different initial pH of the culture medium or in the presence or absence of ferrihydrite. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was observed that Y. lipolytica AN-L15 was able to transform TNT at three different initial proton concentrations of the culture medium: pH 7.0, pH 6.5, and pH 4.5. In the presence of TNT, Y. lipolytica AN-L15 showed preferential growth (OD&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8224;&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8364;&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8364;) at the lower initial pH of 4.5. The increased growth (OD&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8224;&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8364;&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8364;) resulted in increased reduction of TNT-metabolites in the culture medium with an initial pH of 4.5, as compared to, the culture medium with an initial pH of 6.5 or the culture medium with an initial pH of 7.0. TNT transformation via aromatic ring reduction was the major transformation pathway observed, with the major metabolite being 3-H&amp;Igrave;&#8222; -TNT. 4-hydroxylaminodinitrotoluene (4-HADNT) was the major metabolite of the nitro-group reduction pathway. In the presence of ferrihydrite at a pH of 7.0, the transformation of TNT by Y. lipolytica AN-L15 showed a change in the transformation pathway. Nitro-group reduction was the major pathway of TNT transformation in the presence of ferrihydrite with 4-HADNT and 2-aminodinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) being the major metabolites formed. The time it took to reduce TNT was longer and the concentrations of TNT-metabolites were lower in the presence of ferrihydrite than in its absence. This may have been due to competition for available electrons between TNT and TNT-metabolites and Fe(III). It is also possible that some of the intermediate products of TNT transformation were oxidized back to TNT-metabolites by Fe(III) resulting in lower concentrations of TNT-metabolites and increased concentrations of Fe(II). This study demonstrates the complexity of the interactions of various environmental parameters, under controlled laboratory conditions, in the transformation of TNT by Y. lipolytica AN-L15.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/pannier/PannierA0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and implementation of a low cost image correlation system to obtain full-field in-plane displacement and strain data</field><field name="creator">Parker, John Wesley</field><field name="description">When using multi-axial testing, obtaining in-plane strain and displacement data can be difficult and costly. Montana State University's In Plane Loader (IPL) can apply any number of loads in the X and Y axes and as rotation but can only provide the displacement data at the grips. This project uses a Canon consumer-model digital single lens reflex camera and a series of matlab codes to provide in-plane displacement and strain data at as many points on the surface of the loaded specimen as required using Digital Image Correlation. The system has been successfully used to measure surface and boundary displacements on composite and aluminum samples, as well as on glued aluminum joints. The software system has been shown to estimate strains with a strain error of less then 0.0002 m/m or &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;0.5% placing it within ASTM-B2 classification. It also has been shown to measure displacements to within 0.02 pixels accuracy, which for tests on the IPL translates to 0.007mm. The hardware/software system has also been used with the IPL to estimate Young's modulus of aluminum with less then 5% error and yield strength with just over 10% error.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/parker/ParkerJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetics of calcite precipitation by ureolytic bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions</field><field name="creator">Parks, Stacy Leigh</field><field name="description">Carbonate precipitation is a natural phenomenon with a great importance in many chemical and engineering applications. Precipitation can be induced by bacteria as a by-product of common microbial processes, such as ureolysis. In this process, bacteria hydrolyze urea through a series of reactions which raise the pH of the system. In the presence of calcium ions, this rise in pH shifts the saturation state of the system, allowing for solid calcium carbonate (CaCO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;) to form. The use of these bacteria in biotechnical applications is appealing because urea is a fairly inexpensive substrate, and ureolytic bacteria are common in soil and aquatic environments. Bacteriogenic mineral plugging is an innovative use for this process. This technique controls subsurface fluid movement through the reduction of porosity and permeability of geologic formations, such as oil wells and aquifers. A potential use of this technology is in geologic carbon sequestration, which involves capturing CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; and storing it underground in deep saline aquifers. The goal of this project is to determine the kinetics of urea hydrolysis and CaCO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; precipitation for use in the deep subsurface to mitigate potential leakage pathways of sequestered CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218;. To achieve this goal, three species of ureolytic bacteria, S. pasteurii, B. sphaericus strain 21776, and B. sphaericus strain 21787, were grown in batch systems under static conditions. Kinetic analysis was performed on the data gathered in these experiments. Due to the potential lack of oxygen in the deep subsurface, experiments using S. pasteurii were also carried out under anaerobic conditions. Because of the potential need to manipulate the rate of CaCO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; precipitation to allow maximum distribution in the deep saline aquifers, the rates of urea hydrolysis and CaCO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; precipitation among species and between aerobic and anaerobic conditions were compared. All three species studied were capable of inducing calcite precipitation. B. sphaericus strain 21776 exhibited the highest rate coefficient for both ureolysis and CaCO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; precipitation, while B. sphaericus strain 21787 showed the lowest. S. pasteurii is capable of hydrolyzing urea and inducing calcite precipitation in anaerobic environments, although growth in these environments could not be shown conclusively.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/parks/ParksS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of supplemental feeding on stress hormone concentrations in elk</field><field name="creator">Patrek, Victoria Elizabeth</field><field name="description">On twenty-two feedgrounds in western Wyoming, elk (Cervus elaphus) are provided with supplemental feed throughout the winter. Brucellosis seroprevalence of feedground elk is 26% whereas other elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem have historically had a brucellosis seroprevalence of 2-3%. The aggregation of elk during peak transmission allows brucellosis to persist in the feedground populations. In addition to creating the opportunity for disease transmission, the aggregation of elk on feedgrounds may have detrimental physiological effects. Studies have shown that chronically high stress hormone concentrations can suppress the immune system and lead to increased disease susceptibility. Potential stressors on the feedgrounds include high densities, large group sizes and aggressive social interactions. In this study I investigated how factors associated with supplemental feeding affect stress hormone levels, as indexed by fecal glucocorticoid levels, in elk on feedgrounds and elk on native winter range. I also worked with managers to experimentally alter the feeding distribution on the feedgrounds to examine how feeding density affects stress hormone levels and aggression rates. Results show that elk on feedgrounds have stress hormone levels 31% higher than elk on native winter range (Welch's t&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218;&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8225;.&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218;&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;=2.39, p=0.024). Experimental reduction of feed density did not have an effect on stress hormone level or aggression rates. But note the relationship between fGCs and local densities here. Although the feeding treatments did appear to reduce local feeding densities,s this effect was not significant and was small relative to the large differences in density among sites. Regardless as to the cause of the high stress hormone levels seen in supplementally fed elk, the feedgrounds are creating an epidemiological setting for disease transmission and a physiological state that may increase susceptibility to disease. The impact of these stress hormone concentrations on disease susceptibility remains unknown, but may be an important driver of disease dynamics in these elk populations.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/patrek/PatrekV0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene regulation in the lac operon</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Kathryn Grace</field><field name="description">The lac operon, a jointly controlled series of genes in the bacteria E. coli, has been studied extensively since the 1940's. The lac operon genes are transcribed and then translated into proteins necessary for transport and digestion of lactose. The operon is activated in the presence of lactose after glucose, the preferred carbon source, has been expended. In this thesis, we introduce a biophysical model using the Shea-Ackers framework for modeling promoter dynamics. The model spans two scales: the inputs are biophysical parameters of molecular interactions and the result is a level of gene expression - a macroscopic behavior of the cell. We include all experimentally suggested control mechanisms into the model, even though the experimental evidence is stronger for some of these mechanisms than others. We compare our model to experimental data and explore the individual contribution of the proposed mechanisms by removing them one by one and testing the reduced model's fit to the data. Finally, we find a minimal model which faithfully represents the available data, yet includes only the minimal number of control mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/patterson/PattersonK0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water movement in a stratified and inclined snowpack: implications for wet slab avalanches</field><field name="creator">Peitzsch, Erich Hans</field><field name="description">Wet snow avalanches are dangerous and can be particularly difficult to predict. The rate of change from safe snow conditions to dangerous snow conditions occurs rapidly in a wet snowpack, often in response to water production and movement. This research focused on the relationship between snow stratigraphy and water movement in an inclined snowpack. Concentrating on transitions that impede water and flow finger formation within the snowpack, dye tracer was mixed with water and applied to a stratified snowpack to observe and measure the movement of water in various snow grain types, sizes, densities, and temperatures. There were two types of layer transitions that impeded water. Water was impeded at capillary boundaries caused by fine grains over coarse grains. It was also impeded at hydraulic conductivity boundaries, such as ice layers. In layer transitions that impeded water, the grain size of the layer above was significantly smaller than the layer below. The layer above a transition that impeded water was also significantly less dense than the layer below the transition. A qualitative analysis of grain type showed that there was no relationship between grain types in the layer above or below a transition and whether they will or will not impede water. A SnowMicroPen (SMP) was used to measure changes in structural element length to identify capillary boundaries. Results from SMP measurements indicate that microstructural analysis of the snowpack aids in characterizing capillary boundaries that impede water flow. The step change, rate of change, and percent increase were significantly larger in capillary boundaries than transitions that did not impede water for the entire dataset from all 8 sessions. When all transitions were ranked according to absolute change for each profile, capillary boundaries consistently ranked in the top two of all transitions evident within each SMP profile. The amount of water needed to produce flow fingers was highly variable. There was no significant relationship between the amount of water necessary to form flow fingers and snow density, snow grain size, snow temperature, or grain type. Layer transitions that impeded vertical water movement and flow finger formation may both play a large role in wet slab avalanche formation.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/peitzsch/PeitzschE0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restorative Design</field><field name="creator">Penniman, William Edward</field><field name="description">The design challenge for this thesis project is to evaluate the socio-cultural influences of Modern design on the city and people of Chandigarh, India, identify a human need to address and design socially relevant housing for them in current architectural vernacular  The project began with on-site evaluation of the living conditions and people of Chandigarh. Current housing standards and lifestyles were researched photographically and textually through evaluation of thesis projects found at the Chandigarh School of Architecture library. Interviews with local citizens provided the tool for assessment of a need to be addressed. Input from individuals regarding this need and cultural implications with precedent were researched within the setting. From there architectural design evaluation and development methods were applied from the base of study materials accumulated in the Architecture program at MSU. Sketches, models, and graphics developed were reviewed regularly with the advisor group and crit sessions were completed as prescribed. Research with conclusions and material decisions were condensed into the thesis book and reviewed by professors. The building design was then compiled graphically by various means. Models, hand drawings and computer generated graphics were combined for final presentation boards. In concept for the design, application of culturally appropriate elements of material and form that are accepted by current residents will be used to create an individual identity for the residence that is unique yet a community fit. The proposal is not to copy the universal design type or ideals of Le Corbusier applied to Chandigarh, but to counterbalance it with a focus on individuality as a basis for design expression. People, enrichment of their lives and creation of place and belonging, are the heart of this project, not to erase the past, but to move forward in the present from where they have arrived. Saying this in a different way, it would be to present the project as a 21 Century "modern" design, using materials from the "Modernist" vernacular to create a place for celebration of cultural roots while reshaping perception of individual worth for some within the culture.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/penniman/PennimanW0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioral and sensory responses of endemic braconid parasitoids to changes in volatile emissions induced by wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus herbivory</field><field name="creator">Perez, Oscar Gerardo</field><field name="description">Bracon cephi (Gahan) and Bracon lissogaster Muesebeck are considered the most effective biological control agents of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton, probably the most serious wheat insect pest in the northern Great Plains of North America. The great difficulty in controlling this pest suggests an urgent need to improve our understanding of the chemical ecology of these parasitoids to enhance effective control of this pest. Chemical ecology has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in the control of important pests. Plants produce volatile compounds as defenses against herbivory. These compounds play an important role in host selection by herbivores and their natural enemies. Studies revealed that wheat plants infested by C. cinctus produce different amounts of specific compounds compared to uninfested plants. Synthetic compounds matching those produced by sawfly infested wheat plants were tested in three different concentrations against males and females B. cephi and B. lissogaster parasitoids using an electroantennogram system. Six compounds generated positive electrophysiological responses from the parasitoid antennae. Behavioral bioassays using the previous responsive compounds determined that three compounds were attractive to parasitoids of both sexes. To better understand parasitoid host seeking, it was important to quantify and determine the spatial distribution of these behaviorally active compounds as they were emitted from wheat plants. Volatile compounds were collected from infested and uninfested wheat plants at three different heights and two distances in the greenhouse. Greater amounts were collected from the infested plants immediately adjacent to the base of the plants. Field studies were performed to compare concentrations of volatile compounds between areas of heavy and light sawfly infestation. Greater amounts of behaviorally active volatile compounds were collected from areas of heavier sawfly infestation. In conclusion, results show that chemical ecology is a valuable tool in better understanding host seeking in this tritrophic system. This new information on volatile production and dispersal by sawfly infested plants and host seeking behavior of these parasitoids establishes the basis for future exploration of optimal blends of behaviorally active compounds used by parasitoids in host seeking, which may allow for more effective control of the wheat stem sawfly.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/perez/PerezO0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless sensor interrogator design for passive, resonant frequency sensors using frequency modulation spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Brian James</field><field name="description">The lack of passive, wireless, chemical and biological sensor systems is a significant impediment to sensor system applications. While active sensors with a wireless communications link continue to decrease in power consumption, they still require a power source, such as a battery. This active power consumption limits the useful life of the sensor and its applications. A more attractive solution would be a passive, wireless, chemical and biological sensor integrated with a wireless interrogation platform to monitor the sensor. The focus of this thesis is the realization of a wireless sensor interrogator capable of monitoring multiple, passive, resonant-frequency sensors. It is demonstrated, using Frequency Modulation Spectroscopy techniques, that the resonant frequency of a passive sensor can be detected and tracked over time. Simulated results are presented that verify the functionality of the proposed wireless sensor interrogator. In addition, an experimental hardware setup and subsequent experimental results are presented that verify the simulation results.

Background treatments were applied for 29 d. Thereafter, lambs were finished on a corn based diet. Lamb BW and ultrasound measurements were taken at weaning, after background treatment, after feedlot step-up and at the conclusion of the finishing period. Pen intake was measured.

This thesis describes experiments which seek to determine whether or not simulated reflections can reduce front-back confusions for audio presented with non-individualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) via headphones. To measure the contribution of the reflections, 13 human subjects participated in localization experiments which compared their localization ability with anechoic HRTF processing versus HRTF processing with a single early-reflection. The results were highly subject dependent; some showed improvement while others seemed to be inhibited by the reflections. Statistical analysis of the overall results concluded that a single reflection does not provide a significant difference in localization ability. Although this data rejects the hypothesis of this investigation, some suspicion regarding the contribution of lateral reflections in an auditory environment remains.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/reed/ReedD1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disturbance in the garden: toward a new portrayal of wildfire in science and natural history films</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Jeremy Russell</field><field name="description">Science has proven that wildfire has a positive rejuvenating effect on many ecosystems, creating new habitat and bolstering global biodiversity. Despite growing scientific understanding of wildfire over the past 100 years, science and natural history films repeatedly position wildfire merely to achieve dramatic effect. These films typically ignore the available science and in many cases contradict scientific truth outright for the sake of the dramatic narrative. Formulaic conventions developed by Walt Disney and various societal convictions are responsible for the perpetuation of old narrative devices that condemn fire. Science and natural history films reach tens of millions of people each year and shape public opinion of forest fires. These films have perpetuated the myth of Eden, the damning of wildfire, and the valorization of total fire suppression, all of which have had social, political, and economic ramifications. To help align public perception of fire with the current scientific understanding of fire, producers of science and natural history films must redirect their narrative devices that traditionally demonize fire to create a new Eden, one borne of fire. Disturbance represents a new model for the portrayal of wildfire in science and natural history films by employing drama to advance an appreciation of burned forests while avoiding narrative pitfalls that traditionally condemn fire. By combining observational and expository filmmaking modes, Disturbance also offers a new model for conservation-based science and natural history films, a model that incorporates society into nature and conservation into society.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/roberts/RobertsJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence for unconscious thought in complex decisions: the result of a methodological artifact or of an active thought process</field><field name="creator">Runnion, Brett Matthew</field><field name="description">Previous research has suggested that a period of unconscious thought can result in judgments that are equal or superior to those of conscious thought (Dijksterhuis, 2004). The existence of unconscious thought as a decision-making process is controversial. In fact, it has been suggested that unconscious thought is not a process rather the evidence supporting it is the result of a methodological artifact (Lassiter et al., in press) that only occurs when participants can retrieve online judgments. This thesis attempts to resolve this controversy. Participants received information describing 4 cars (acquisition stage) that were described by twelve dichotomous attributes (e.g., good/poor mileage). The best car possessed mostly positive characteristics and the worst car had mostly negative characteristics. Participants were told before or after the information was presented, that they would be forming an impression of the four cars. They were then allowed to think about the cars consciously for 4 minutes, were distracted for 4 minutes (unconscious thought), or were asked to make an immediate decision without thinking. When the instructions to form an impression were received before acquiring the information, the participants could form online judgments during acquisition. These could later be retrieved when participants reported their attitudes. When the instructions to form an impression were received after participants acquired the information, they could not form online judgments, but could form only memory-based judgments after the information was presented. Without online judgments, participants are forced to rely on memory-based judgments. Thus, if participants in the unconscious-thought condition formed more favorable attitudes toward the best car relative to the attitudes formed by the participants in the other two conditions, a thought process must be occurring. Additionally, these attitudes should transfer to choosing the best car as well. However, the results of this thesis failed to replicate previous research (Lassiter et al., in press) as the dependent measures failed to reach significance.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/runnion/RunnionB0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of nucleotide-dependent electron transfer and substrate binding in nitrogen fixation and chlorophyll biosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Sarma, Ranjana</field><field name="description">The studies presented in this thesis include studies of nucleotide-dependent conformations of the electron donor protein in nitrogenase and dark-operative protochlorophyllide reductase (DPOR) characterized using small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray diffraction methods. Nitrogen fixation and chlorophyll synthesis are involved in the reduction of high energy bonds under physiological conditions. Both make use of elegant reaction mechanisms made possible by complex enzyme systems which are evolutionarily related. Nitrogenase reduces nitrogen to ammonia and is a two-component metalloenzyme composed of Fe protein and MoFe protein. For nitrogen reduction, the Fe protein and MoFe protein associate and dissociate in a manner concomitant with hydrolysis of at least two MgATP molecules and enables the concomitant transfer of at least one electron from Fe protein to MoFe protein. During chlorophyll biosysnthesis, the rate limiting step is catalyzed by a two-component metalloenzyme called DPOR. The two components of DPOR are BchL and BchNB proteins and these share high level of sequence similarity with the Fe protein and the MoFe protein, respectively. Based on this sequence similarity and biochemical data available, it is proposed that the reaction mechanism is similar to nitrogenase mechanism in which the components of DPOR associate and dissociate in a nucleotide dependent manner, to enable intercomponent electron transfer. Fe protein and BchL present as unique examples of proteins that couple nucleotide dependent conformational change to enable electron transfer for high energy bond reduction. The present studies have been directed at studying the low resolution studies of MgATP-bound wild-type Fe protein and its comparison to the structure of the proposed mimic, i.e, L127 Delta Fe protein. The studies presented show evidence of the MgATP-bound wild-type Fe protein having a conformation very different from the L127 Delta Fe protein. The chapters also include detailed characterization of the structure of BchL in both MgADP bound and nucleotide-free states which offer detailed insights in the structure based mechanism of BchL, with primary focus on identifying key residues involved in componenet docking and in electron transfer. Together, the studies on the Fe protein and BchL have furthered our understanding of mechanism of electron transfer in these complex enzyme systems.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/sarma/SarmaR1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasonic repair of polymers: fundamentals and modeling for self-healing</field><field name="creator">Sarrazin, John Cody</field><field name="description">Although current research focuses within self-healing materials are advancing, most pursuits are passive systems, unlike the active biological systems they aim to mimic. In this paper an active method utilizing ultrasonic energy is explored. Ultrasonic inspection has served as an effective means toward nondestructive damage detection for decades. Also, a recent method called time-reversed acoustics allows for the redirection of acoustic waves back towards the source. The active healing method utilizes ultrasonic nondestructive damage detection to locate and categorize damage, and then provide coordinates for the redirection of an amplified ultrasonic energy to heal the material. First, the temperature change as a result of ultrasonic treatment was measured, and then a variety of dogbone samples were tensile tested, including virgin samples, damaged samples, and damaged but ultrasonically treated dogbone samples. The ultrasonic treatment increased the ultimate stress of the ultrasonically treated dogbone samples, which was a result of increased crystallinity. The crystallinity was confirmed with differential thermal analyses. The ultrasonic influence of material temperature and effect of ultrasonically treated damaged samples versus just untreated damaged samples were replicated with finite element models as a means to predict future application and use.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/sarrazin/SarrazinJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping changes in Yellowstone's geothermal areas</field><field name="creator">Savage, Shannon Lea</field><field name="description">Yellowstone National Park (YNP) contains the world's largest concentration of geothermal features, and is legally mandated to protect and monitor these natural features. Remote sensing is a component of the current geothermal monitoring plan. Landsat satellite data have a substantial historical archive and will be collected into the future, making it the only available thermal imagery for historical analysis and long-term monitoring of geothermal areas in the entirety of YNP. Landsat imagery from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors was explored as a tool for mapping geothermal heat flux and geothermally active areas within YNP and to develop a change analysis technique for scientists to utilize with additional Landsat data available from 1978 through the foreseeable future. Terrestrial emittance and estimates of geothermal heat flux were calculated for the entirety of YNP with two Landsat images from 2007 (TM) and 2002 (ETM+). Terrestrial emittance for fourteen summer dates from 1986 to 2007 was calculated for defined geothermal areas and utilized in a change analysis. Spatial and temporal change trajectories of terrestrial emittance were examined. Trajectories of locations with known change events were also examined. Relationships between the temporal clusters and spatial groupings and several change vectors (distance to geologic faults, distance to large water bodies, and distance to earthquake swarms) were explored. Finally, TM data from 2007 were used to classify geothermally active areas inside the defined geothermal areas as well as throughout YNP and a 30-km buffer around YNP. Estimations of geothermal heat flux were inaccurate due to inherent limitations of Landsat data combined with complexities arising from the effects of solar radiation and spatial and temporal variation of vegetation, microbes, steam outflows, and other features at each geothermal area. Terrestrial emittance, however, was estimated with acceptable results. The change analysis showed a relationship between absolute difference in terrestrial emittance and earthquake swarms, with 34% of the variation explained. Accuracies for the classifications of geothermally active areas were poor, but the method used for classification, random forest, could be a suitable method given higher resolution thermal imagery and better reference data.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/savage/SavageS0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The BBC Natural History Unit: publicly funded broadcasting in the United Kingdom and its advantages for the production of natural history films</field><field name="creator">Savoie, Philip Antoine</field><field name="description">The British Broadcasting Corporation's Natural History Unit (BBC NHU) is the most successful producer of nature television.

Architecture could become the medium to create that connection as well as the physical manifestation of our understanding of existence and of time, which facilitates this connection. This thesis seeks an understanding of self and place through our sensory connection to nature. In our modern world, we are presented with a growing amount of synthetic and manufactured surroundings that are designed to be perceived through sight, while sound, smell, taste and touch are considered secondary senses, and experiential quality is not inherent. Our society is moving farther away from a connection to nature and a connection to the earth. I believe that through sensory connection to our natural surroundings we will reinvigorate a deeper connection with ourselves and to the environment. This thesis is exploring how nature is the medium for a deeper connection and understanding of ourselves, who we are, and how we interact with the environment through sensory perception. Natural materials and practices are being replaced with synthetics, which lack the cyclical nature and life of natural materials. Machine-made products lack the ability to connect on a humanistic level due to their perpetual state of youth. "We are increasingly detaching ourselves from 'organic and functional periodicity' which is dictated by nature, and replacing it by 'mechanical periodicity' which is dictated by the schedule, the calendar, and the clock."&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3; These fabricated objects intensify the isolated state of man from the natural world through their constant neglect of the senses and disregard for the energies intrinsic in natural materials. It is my belief that to be able to live meaningful and impassioned lives, we must become more aware of fabricated surroundings, and return to natural environment from which we came. By refocusing on natural processes and materials in the built environment, man can reawaken the relationship we have with nature. I believe that through understanding our surrounding's impact, we can connect with not only ourselves, but the environment.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/schroeder/SchroederS1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactive transport in biofouled and biomineralized porous media</field><field name="creator">Schultz, Logan Nicholas</field><field name="description">The geologic subsurface environment contains regions of high porosity where fluid flows both naturally and during engineered technologies such as carbon sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, and bioremediation of contaminants. In these porous media regions, microbes can have both desirable and undesirable effects on the hydrodynamics and fluid chemistry by inducing the formation of microbial aggregates, which can include extracellular polymeric substance and abiotic particles such as mineral precipitates. While not the focus of this research, these analyses are likewise applicable to biomatter control scenarios in filtration systems and other industrial reactors with a high surface area to volume ratio. Microbially-induced ureolytic calcium carbonate precipitation has been suggested as a means to mitigate leakage from geologic CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; sequestration sites and as a means to immobilize divalent contaminants such as strontium-90 in remediation scenarios. In this process, microbes hydrolyze urea, increasing the solution pH, generating carbonate ions, and ultimately shifting the saturation state of the fluid and leading to solid calcium carbonate (CaCO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;) formation in a calcium-rich environment. Experiments were conducted to assess the distribution and effects of biofouling and biomineralization in two-dimensional flat plate reactors with 1mm pore spaces simulating a tortuous porous media environment. In biomineralization experiments, calcium carbonate was formed under flow conditions, and strontium was effectively immobilized within the crystal lattice, suggesting the applicability of subsurface biotechnical applications utilizing this technology. Image, residence time distribution, and piezometer analyses of biofouling experiments quantified porosity and hydraulic conductivity reductions. Biofilms were grown under constant flow and head conditions and were shown to be more channeled and evenly distributed along the flow path in constant flow conditions. Biofilms were challenged with chlorinated bleach, which temporarily increased the hydraulic conductivity, yet failed to remove significant biofouling unless coupled with significant fluid shear. In situ methods utilizing stereo and confocal microscopy were developed to visualize and quantify the distribution of biomatter formation and analyze the biological environment at the surface of bio-induced minerals.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/schultz/SchultzL1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network dynamics and fluctuating architectural typology: Flux</field><field name="creator">Schumacher, Ryan Donald</field><field name="description">Located in the northern United States, along the Rocky Mountains, lies the state of Montana. Traditionally rural, Montana is experiencing significant growth in its urban and destination areas. With growth comes obstacles and opportunities. The majority of the state is sufficiently connected to the global transportation network for the movement of goods, but lacks diverse people moving systems. While goods have the benefit of being transported at high speeds via road, rail, and air, the majority of people do not. Roadways near urban areas are frequent victims of congestion, the vitality of many airports is in question, and rail is minimized to a northern Amtrak route that neglects most population centers. The lack of passenger transit systems effectively cuts travel possibilities in half for hundreds of thousands people. Montanans deserve an option for the future that streamlines their transportation infrastructure, integrates them with the rest of the world, and provides an example of positive development. The intent of this thesis is to analyze the current network of people moving systems in Montana in order to determine how a better understanding of network dynamics and transportation architecture can help create connections to the global transportation network and foster positive growth. Information will be presented in graphic and literary form starting with the economic and transportation infrastructure in the region. Precedents are used to gain insight on existing and proposed architectural solutions to facilitate a proposal for an integrated transportation network in Montana, using architecture that utilizes continuous change, passage, and movement as active support.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/schumacher/SchumacherR0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vegetative reproduction and the integrated management of Canada thistle</field><field name="creator">Sciegienka, Joanna Katarzyna</field><field name="description">Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) is an aggressive, introduced creeping perennial weed that flourishes in a wide variety of environments. Its deep, creeping root system and colony forming tendencies make it one of the most difficult weeds to control. A strategy that incorporates a better understanding of the biology of Canada thistle into the development of an integrated management plan that includes herbicides and biological control could help reduce the dispersal and impact of this species. The objectives of this work were to: 1) determine how Canada thistle emergence and growth are affected by changes in root size, biomass, burial depth, and soil moisture and 2) compare single and joint impacts of herbicides and biological control agents on Canada thistle growth. Objective 1 was carried out in a greenhouse and in field conditions. To monitor Canada thistle emergence and growth responses, a completely randomized factorial design was used in the greenhouse, and a randomized complete block design was used in the field. Models were developed to predict emergence and growth patterns based on available water, burial depth, and various root metrics. For the exception of available water, the same predictors were used in field conditions to predict Canada thistle emergence and growth. The variables that were manipulated were able to significantly predict the responses measured, and we concluded that available water, root burial depth, and root weight, length, diameter, and volume are indicators of emergence likelihood, emergence time, shoot and root growth, and shoot number. Objective 2 was carried out in greenhouses and field settings. Three herbicides were evaluated with and without insects to determine reduction in Canada thistle root and shoot biomass in the greenhouse. One herbicide was also used at a low rate and evaluated singly and in combination with a stem-boring weevil (Hadroplontus litura (F.)) and a pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tagetis) to determine effect on Canada thistle response in the greenhouse and field. We failed to reject our null hypothesis of additivity between control agents, and concluded that integrating individual control methods yields greater Canada thistle control than any singular method.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/sciegienka/SciegienkaJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Action research in mathematics education: a study of a master's program for teachers</field><field name="creator">Segal, Sarah Ultan</field><field name="description">Action research is a methodology that has been found to be valuable as a problem-solving tool. It can provide opportunities for reflection, improvement, and transformation of teaching. The purpose of this study is to better understand these claims about the benefits of action research. Several research questions stand out: How is action research experienced by teachers? Is it beneficial and practical for teachers who use it? How are action research findings typically validated? What factors influence whether teachers are able to continue to practice action research? What kind of change has it initiated for teachers? And, how does action research focused on improving student achievement affect high need students? For the past five years, forty-five teachers completing master's degrees in mathematics education at a northern Rocky Mountain land-grant university have been required to conduct an action research project, referred to as their "capstone project." By studying this group of graduates, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data through surveys and interviews, I have examined the effectiveness of action research. This data, combined with graduates' capstone projects, has provided partial answers to the above questions, restricted to faculty-mediated action research within master's programs for mathematics teachers. The extent to which such action research projects impact teachers' practices has not been investigated before. While acknowledging that this research relied primarily upon self-reported data, the results strongly support what the research literature generally asserts about action research. (a) It is beneficial and often transformational for teachers as a professional development tool by allowing them to engage in a focused study of their own practice. (b) When done less formally it becomes more practical. (c) Communicating with others in the field builds confidence in teachers as professionals. (d) It makes teachers more actively reflective and more aware of their teaching and their students' learning. (e) It is effective in understanding and addressing the particular needs of high need students. Continued practice was highly dependent on time and support for action research within the school. Teachers often expressed the importance of having an action research community while conducting their capstones.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/segal/SegalS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-situ electrical terminal characterization of fuel cell stacks</field><field name="creator">Seger, Eric Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates in-situ characterization of a 5kW solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack and a 165W proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack at the electrical terminals, using impedance spectroscopy and time-domain modeling.

The PEMFC experiments are performed using exogenous excitation from a boost converter. In contrast to typical off-line analysis using specialized instrumentation, the measurements are made as the stacks deliver power to their respective loads.

Thus, erythroid precursor cells possess an efficient mechanism for iron uptake in which iron loaded transferrin (Tf) binds to the transferrin receptor (TfR) at the cell surface. The Tf:TfR complex then enters the endosome via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon endosomal acidification, iron is released from Tf, reduced to Fe&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm; by Steap3, and transported across the endosomal membrane by divalent metal ion transporter 1. Steap3 is comprised of an N-terminal cytosolic oxidoreductase domain and a C-terminal heme-containing transmembrane domain. The NADPH/flavin binding domain of Steap3 differs significantly from those in other eukaryotic reductases. Steap3 shows remarkable, although limited homology to FNO, an archaeal oxidoreductase. We have determined the crystal structure of the human-Steap3 oxidoreductase domain in the absence and presence of NADPH (PDB-ID 2vns and 2vq3). The structure of the oxidoreductase domain reveals an unexpected dimmer interface and substrate binding sites that are well positioned to direct electron transfer from the cytosol to a transmembrane heme moiety. Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) was the first icosahedral virus characterized from an archaeal host. It infects Sulfolobus species that thrive in the acidic hot springs (pH 2-4 and 72-9&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C) of Yellowstone National Park. The capsid architecture and the structure of its major capsid protein are very similar to those of the bacteriophage PRD1 and eukaryotic viruses Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 and adenovirus, suggesting a viral lineage that predates the three domains of life. The turrets found on the capsid of STIV are prominent structures that are expected to be involved in host recognition, DNA delivery and may be involved in DNA packaging during viral particle assembly. STIV proteins A223, C381 and C557 constitute the vertex complex that forms these turrets. We report here the efforts to structurally characterize A223. Fold recognition algorithms predict A223 and C381 to have folds similar to that of P5 vertex protein from PRD1, further supporting the possible evolutionary link. This structural similarity has been exploited in attempts to solve the structure of A223 using Molecular Replacement.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/sendamarai/SendamaraiA1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intermission</field><field name="creator">Shvartsman, Ron Felix</field><field name="description">We are no longer only influenced by social exchange that occurs in close proximity. Our character can now be defined by everything that occurs around us. The television, Internet and cell phone are only a few mediums that give people the ability to communicate and exchange information at the press of a button. Even the typical family circle is no match for the powerful interdependencies that unite all people yet in some moments keeps them divided. Methods of social exchange have changed dramatically over the last century allowing people to interact at any proximity they choose making them part of a larger system that relies heavily on being connected to various communication technologies (CT). How we communicate, now more than ever, is an integral part of the way in which we shape our world. With so many mediums of communication and the exponential growth of social exchange it is difficult to understand the implications of our actions in regards to CT. One such scenario entails the person who going about his or her day is in constant connection through an electronic device which supplies him or her the freedom to be at any given place at one moment and another the next second. It must be noted that even though this person has that freedom, he or she can only connect to someone who possesses a similar medium. What about the individual who has no medium with which to communicate at a similar rate? As we continue to "efficiently" interact within a digital world we create strong social ties to people that fit within our own unique demographic. We attach ourselves to what we know creating weak social ties to people that fit within a different user group. Weak social ties (links) form a network of information carrying connections between different demographics. These connections are better able to carry novel technology information that we don't have access to within strong social networks that tend to move in the same circles. By increasing the potential for weak social connections to form one can begin to close the social gap which has left people divided in a digital world.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/shvartsman/ShvartsmanR0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language as structure for memory communities</field><field name="creator">Simonich, Daniel Patrick</field><field name="description">Architecture is a language - an intense cultural and historical force. This thesis will expound how architecture reflects, and contributes to, an identity via spoken language and diachronic cultural signals. While our built world is not easily reduced to literally grammatical morphemes, architecture offers equally meaningful, albeit abstract, messages of semiotic importance. I believe it is our individual and collective rendering of language that affords the promise of multiple understandings and creative solutions. Yet, the messages presented and perceived by our designed surroundings, at home and abroad, remain largely under-analyzed and discounted as prospective remedies to universal problems. Our built environment speaks enormously about our past and future, social priorities, demographic fluxes, aesthetic proclivities, etc. Ultimately, it is the world we construct which conveys our identity and prompts recognition of each other and ourselves. I accept a future where architecture obliges a global acuity that acknowledges an associative, multi-presence of cultures and can translate an identifiable 'local' character. Similarly, an architectural disparity manifest from a multilingual society affords a unique opportunity to study how language might be structured, to influence a formative role in architecting a pluralist future. This thesis will consider how the protracted marginalization of a culture and the gradual forfeiture of its language challenge how a cultural 'memory' is sustained - despite a steady linguistic and architectural regression. In fact, contrasting architectural and linguistic practices used by burgeoning communities, this thesis will examine how economic and geographic isolation have led moribund minorities to an assortment of survival strategies, including - aside from emigration or assimilation - a dependence on mythologized culture and the memorializing of architecture as bastions for identity and remembering a common history. If identity is memory, then the linguistic vestiges of a place offer a chance to recall and re-imagine an architectural lingo that fortifies a prior history, so as to re-contextualize a shared future in a country, and in a world, of competing cultural identities. This thesis will explore how architecture may inherently propagate a 'dialogue' in multilingual domains, for a temporal dissemination of identity by virtue of memory communities.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/simonich/SimonichD1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimum-data analysis of ecosystem service supply with risk averse decision makers</field><field name="creator">Smart, Francis Clayton</field><field name="description">There is a need for models that produce results that are both timely and sufficiently accurate to be useful to policy makers. The minimum-data approach of Antle and Valdivia (2006) responds to this need by supplying a spatially explicit first order approximation that models ecosystem supply by producers. However, producers in developing nations often are observed to deviate from simple expected profit maximization. Risk is one possible explanation for this divergence. This study builds upon the minimum-data approach by allowing for risk averse producer preferences. The study presents a framework for translating relative risk aversion measurements into the parameters needed for the mean-standard deviation utility function. This study utilizes experimental and econometric measurements of risk aversion by other researchers to parameterize the model. Historic weather data are used with crop yield models to simulate temporal variation in crop yields. The model is used to simulate the supply of carbon sequestration in Machakos, Kenya. At low levels of risk, producers behave in a manner consistent with risk neutrality. However as risks and risk aversion levels increase, there is an increasing divergence from the behavior implied by expected profit maximization. The effects of varying the structure of risk preferences were also examined. This study finds that, consistent with the results in a number of other studies, the level of risk aversion is generally a more important factor in simulated behavior than the structure of risk preferences. This study also examines the effects of increasing the spatial variation of returns. As the spatial variation of returns increases, the predicted producer behavior converges on a fifty percent rate of adoption of the carbon sequestering system, regardless of other parameters. Overall, this study finds that - at levels of risk aversion measured in similar populations in developing nations - the inclusion of risk aversion in the model provides an explanation for why the observed behavior of producers appears to diverge from expected profit maximization.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/smart/SmartF0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization and isolation of Archael thermophilic hosts and viruses from Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Spuhler, Joshua Lupine</field><field name="description">My research is focused on the identification and characterization of new archaeal viruses that inhabit the thermal features of Yellowstone National Park (YNP).

From this work a new host has been isolated from YNP. rDNA analysis has shown a 98% similarity to Thermocladium modestius. Routine culturing of this host has lead to the discovery of multiple viruses. Some of these associated viruses have similar morphology to other known archaeal viruses. The first is a 90x60 nm spindle shaped virus that was originally isolated from Rabbit Creek thermal feature (Temp78, pH3.5). Our initial genomic analysis shows that there is no obvious similarity to other known archaeal viruses, included the SSV spindled shaped viruses for Sulfolobus. The second sequencing effort has come from Nymph Lake thermal feature (Temp 85, pH 2.5). This virus population was gathered from a primary enrichment culture. This culture had two dominate virus morphologies present. The first is a 15nmx210nm rod-shaped virus with tapered ends. The second morphology seen is a 90nm spherical virus.

Mixtures of drought tolerant or native species in sod could be used as an alternative to seed to provide rapid establishment of desirable plant communities that may potentially reduce weed emergence, survival, and productivity. Additionally, the reinforcement material required to aid transport of multispecies sod could further contribute to weed suppression and sod establishment. The objective of this study was to evaluate the weed suppression and establishment potential of multispecies sod. Three experiments were each subject to a water regime ranging from 2.54 cm of water/week to natural precipitation, and repeated over two/three years. In the first two experiments (A and B) Brassica napus (canola) was used as a surrogate weed species and sown either below the multispecies sod to represent weed seed bank, or above the multispecies sod to represent weed seed rain. In experiment A, B. napus was sown at six densities; while in experiment B reinforcement materials (nylon netting control, coconut-straw, jute, excelsior) were added below the sod and B. napus was sown at one density. B. napus suppression by multispecies sod, with or without reinforcement material, was evaluated by recording seedling emergence, survival and above-ground biomass. Multispecies sod, especially combined with reinforcement material, suppressed a large proportion of seedling emergence. The seedlings that did establish produced less vegetative and seed biomass as water decreased. In the second season of both experiments no seedlings survived to maturity. The establishment success of the multispecies sod was evaluated through repeated measures of percent sod cover over two/three years. The results suggested that the multispecies sod was able to establish and persist under natural precipitation. The third experiment evaluated the ability of multispecies sod to suppress Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) vegetative propagules in two different habitat types, bare ground or multispecies sod, under high and low water treatments. More C. arvense shoots emerged in the bare ground, suggesting that multispecies sod could act as a buffer zone and reduce the vegetative spread of perennial weeds if used as a revegetation strategy.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/stark/StarkJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic medical record implementation in nursing practice: a literature review of the factors of success</field><field name="creator">Steiner, Bridget Anne</field><field name="description">This is a review of the current literature to discern what factors need to be present in an electronic medical record (EMR) implementation in order for it to be successful for nurses.

This technology increases the efficiency of the converter past 90% while reducing the size of the components. The converter was built and tested and achieved a 91.5% efficiency at full load. The total cost was $0.28 / watt. This converter met all the design goals while exceeding the cost goals. The second converter is targeted for residential fuel cell applications. This converter utilizes the technology developed for the industrial converter. This residential converter is designed for an input of 26-42 volts at 190 amps and an output of 400 volts and 12 amps at a power level of 5000 watts while maintaining a $40/kilowatt cost goal. To achieve the low cost and high efficiency design goals the converter uses several technologies in its construction. Like the converter for industrial applications this converter utilizes zero voltage switching full bridge converter. To compensate for the high input current a unique multiphase design was designed for the application. A unique parallel input / series output topology and three interleaved converters split the input current to increase the efficiency of the converter. This unique topology increases the switching frequency on the secondary side which reduces the side of the passive components, reducing cost. The converter was built and tested at a light load to verify its operation versus the theory. An estimated 96% efficiency at full load is possible using this topology. The total cost was $39 / kilowatt.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/sternberg/SternbergK1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community education on stroke: early recognition and timely access to healthcare</field><field name="creator">Stobie, Paula Anna</field><field name="description">In 2006, data collected from a hospital emergency room centrally located in Sanders County, Montana revealed that 33% of patients presenting with possible stroke symptoms were eligible to be evaluated for treatment with a potentially life-saving intervention. As a member of the community, I felt this rate of treatment could be improved. Review of data from state and national sources showed similar treatment statistics nationwide. One consistent suggestion in the literature for improving stroke detection and treatment was for increased public education. As a result of these findings I developed, presented, and evaluated a community-based education presentation on stroke symptoms and treatment. Knowledge about stroke symptoms and treatment was measured prior to the presentation and again afterwards with a pre- and post-test tool. Results of this testing showed overall improvement in the audience's knowledge. On-going evaluation of emergency room data to assess for an improved percentage of persons being treated was beyond the scope of this project. Information discovered in a review of the literature consistently points out that late arrival to the Emergency Department is one of the major reasons people are not being treated for stroke, and most sources call specifically for increased public awareness regarding stroke and treatment available. This project served to educate a small population of people in a county with multiple risk factors for stroke. Although ongoing refinement and data collection are needed, continued use of this educational tool may serve to improve treatment of stroke, potentially decreasing the death and disability attributed to stroke in this county.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/stobie/StobieP1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of soil/vegetation on flood irrigated hayfields in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming: a predictive evaluation tool for agricultural wetlands</field><field name="creator">Summerford, Sarah Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The Elk Ranch hayfield in Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) has been historically flood-irrigated since the early 20th Century. The park service is now considering closing irrigation to restore native plant communities and enhance Spread Creek fisheries and will need information on the extent of irrigation-created wetlands and how irrigation cessation would change the vegetative component of the ranch. The main objective of this study was to assess the relation between soil and vegetation characteristics of wetland community types at the ranch and to determine if any of the relationships could be used to differentiate between naturally occurring and irrigation created wetlands. Vegetation data were collected from transects centered on a soil pit at 28 randomly located sample points throughout the hayfield. Twenty-six of the 28 sample plots were classified as wetland based on criteria listed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling were used to analyze percent foliar cover, wetland index value (WIV), soil texture, percent organic matter, redox contrast and abundance, and depth to groundwater and soil saturation for each of the sampled points. The WIV and redox contrast had the greatest dissimilarity (D2), 0.90, and 0.71 respectively across the hayfield. The other measured characteristics had D2 values ranging from 0.23 to 0.49 and were strongly correlated with the WIV and redox contrast measures. However, inclusion of these measures contributed little to the differences already identified. Categorical organization of WIV and redox measures indicated that naturally occurring wetlands could be differentiated from wetlands created by flood irrigation in former upland vegetation communities. Combining wetland index value and soil redox contrast suggests park managers could identify wetland community types likely to remain or transition following cessation of flood irrigation at the Elk Ranch. Additional testing at other GTNP sites will be necessary to test the broad application of this approach and refine the assessment categories.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/summerford/SummerfordS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical approaches to probe environmental stress in Archaea</field><field name="creator">Tarlykov, Pavel Victorovich</field><field name="description">Little is known about strategies and mechanisms employed by thermophilic organisms to adapt to environmental stress. Sulfolobus solfataricus is a thermophile that belongs to Archaea, the third domain of life, and can be found in unusual habitats, such as the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. This archaeon can tolerate high temperature, extreme acidity and high concentrations of heavy metals and other toxic substances. Thus, S. solfataricus has been chosen by many researchers as a model system for biochemical, structural, and genetic studies. In this work S. solfataricus has been exposed to hydrogen peroxide as a natural mild oxidant and arsenic as a common toxic metalloid. One of the aims was to quantitatively define the regulation of proteins upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide or arsenic species in different time periods and concentrations. In this sense, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach in conjunction with novel chemical tagging probes has been applied to detect changes on the level of regulation and chemical modification of individual proteins within the whole proteome in response to the stressors. Proteins expression levels have been monitored, redox-sensitive and phosphoproteomic profiles of the S. solfataricus proteome have been identified. Synthesis of the results has allowed a general scheme for how S. solfataricus fights H2O2- and As-induced stress. Lists of mapped proteins have been created and potential biomarkers for oxidative stress have been identified, which can guide further research to better understand mechanisms of proteomic response to the environmental stress in Archaea on the example of thermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/tarlykov/TarlykovP0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selecting plant species to optimize wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Carrie Renee</field><field name="description">Constructed wetlands are used around the world for treating domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastewater, stormwater runoff, and acid mine drainage. Plants may affect efficacy of wastewater treatment through their influence on microbial activity by creating attachment sites and releasing carbon exudates and oxygen. My research investigated seasonal plant effects on wastewater treatment by monitoring water chemistry in model subsurface wetlands planted with monocultures of 19 plant species and unplanted controls. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, an indicator of water quality, declined during colder temperatures in the unplanted control, likely caused by a decrease in microbial activity. In contrast, wetlands with most plant species had constant COD removal across seasons. Redox potential and sulfate concentrations were measured as indirect measurements of the oxygenation of the wastewater. Wetlands that had a decline in COD removal during cold temperatures had constant low redox potential and sulfate concentrations throughout the seasons. Wetlands with high COD removal across seasons had elevated redox potentials and sulfate concentrations during the winter, indicating elevated oxygen availability, which may offset the negative temperature effect on microbial processes. I measured root oxygen loss (ROL) in the summer and the winter to determine whether oxygen release was sufficient to influence wastewater treatment and cause seasonal and species-specific effects on water chemistry. COD removal and ROL were positively correlated at 4&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C but not at 24&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C; however, the amount of root oxygen release only accounted for a portion of the required oxygen to facilitate plant's influence on COD removal. Flooding tolerance was quantified for each species by comparing plants' biomass between flooded and drained conditions. Plants' botanical grouping, Wetland Indicator Status, and flooding tolerance were compared to plants' influences on wastewater treatment to determine whether easily measured plant traits can be used to identify plants that will optimize wastewater treatment. All the sedges and rushes, obligate wetlands species, and 8 of 9 flood-tolerant plants had greater COD removal than the control at 4&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C, the coldest temperature incubation. These results can be applied for wetland design by selecting plant species to optimize wastewater treatment, especially in cold climates.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/taylor/TaylorC0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multistate mark recapture analysis to estimate reproductive rate in the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), an endangered species</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Rebecca Lynn</field><field name="description">The Steller sea lion is an endangered species whose reproductive rate estimates need to be updated. The species is divided into two populations: the endangered western population has declined over 80% from historical levels, while the threatened eastern population has been increasing at approximately 3% for the past three decades. The statistically most compelling reproductive rate estimates for this species are based on now out of date population dynamics, and hence are not applicable to current concerns. Extensive recent branding and resighting efforts by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Southeast Alaska make possible an updated estimation of eastern population Steller sea lion reproductive rates. However, the complexity of these data required a different statistical approach than is typically used to estimate reproduction in marked and resighted animals. I developed a novel statistical analysis, based upon a multistate mark recapture likelihood function, specifically to analyze the Southeast Alaska Steller sea lion data. The likelihood function estimates a reproductive rate when only adult females (not pups) are marked, female sightability is correlated with reproductive status, state classification uncertainty is present and the population is open to births during many of the resighting intervals. I apply this analysis to the Southeast Alaska Steller sea lion data and estimate a reproductive rate of 0.66 (0.55, 0.77). Not only does this provide a reproductive rate estimate for the eastern population, which is important for monitoring its health, but it also provides a basis for comparison to the endangered western population. Furthermore, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game continues to have an active branding and resighting program. The methods developed here can be applied to future data collected in either population.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/taylor/TaylorR0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of a two color LIDAR system to study atmospheric aerosols</field><field name="creator">Todt, Benjamin David</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates the use of a two color lidar (light detection and ranging) instrument for the purpose of studying atmospheric aerosols.

While the costs of YSZ have decreased from demand and improved manufacturing, large amounts of energy are required to properly densify the ceramic material inflating of the overall cost of this material. YSZ must be completely dense to ensure that the fuels used for power generation do not combine resulting in failure of the cell. The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of low level nickel oxide dopants as a sintering aid to reduce the high sintering temperature process while also evaluating the mechanical and ionic conduction behavior. Baseline samples, of both 8YSZ and 3YSZ, were tested and compared to samples doped with concentrations of nickel oxide up to 1 mole %. Transition metal additives may have the potential to increase the electrical conductivity and/or decrease the ionic conductivity of the YSZ, therefore only a maximum of 1 mole % nickel was added to the ceramic powder. It was determined that one mole percent of nickel oxide added to the traditional tape casting slurry achieved the greatest improvement in theoretical density, sintering rate, and onset of densification at 1300&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C using standard micron sized powders. Utilizing impedance spectroscopy, it was shown that overall the nickel dopant yielded a negligible change in total conductivity, however, it is noted that a slight increase in the grain boundary contribution was observed for the doped specimens. Mechanical strength testing was conducted with a concentric ring on ring compressive flexural strength standard according to ASTM guidelines indicating an average 40% increase in strength over the undoped specimens for all sintering temperatures. Evaluation of grain size and fracture patterns for doped and undoped specimens indicates significant grain growth and a transition to transgranular fracture with the doped specimens.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/townsend/TownsendZ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in practice used to quantify breast milk intake of pre-term infants in a neonatal intensive care unit: test-weighing to 'Salt Lake Feed Plan'</field><field name="creator">Treloar, Allison Kirsch</field><field name="description">A local community hospital in Montana expressed a desire to establish a written clinical guideline for transitioning preterm infants from enteral gavage feedings to oral feedings. This desire was prompted by a change in the method of quantifying breast milk intake of preterm infants when transitioning them from enteral gavage feedings to at-breast feedings in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The hospital changed from the practice of test-weighing as a clinical indicator to quantify breast milk intake to the "Salt Lake City Feed Plan". Procedures: Retrospective data from four consecutive years were collected from quality assessment chart audit data provided to the author in aggregate form. Twenty-nine records met the selection criteria. A descriptive presentation of the aggregate data follows. Results: The average number of total deliveries per year was 1,151. The average percentage of preterm deliveries that occurred between 32 - 37 completed weeks of gestation was 16.3 percent. Of the twenty-nine records that met the selection criteria, 17 were male and 12 were female. The birth weight ranged from 1.75 kilograms (kg) to 2.31 kg. Weight at discharge ranged from 2.66 kg. to 2.99 kg., indicating a weight gain of 0.68 kg. to 0.91 kg. at discharge. Number of days with an indwelling nasogastric enteral feeding tube ranged from 1 to 23 days. Length of hospital stay ranged from 7 to 29 days. The length of stay for exclusively bottle fed preterm infants ranged from 13 to 27 days, whereas the breastfeeding preterm infants who utilized test -weighing or the "Salt Lake City Feed Plan" ranged from 7 to 29 days. Breast fed preterm infants in whom test-weighing or the "Salt Lake City Feed Plan" was utilized had 4 to 4.315 fewer days of hospitalization compared to preterm infants who were exclusively bottle-fed. Conclusion: The literature review and the aggregate data collected by the rural community hospital provide baseline information to create, implement and support an evidence-based clinical guideline to transition preterm infants from enteral gavage feedings to oral feeding.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/treloar/TreloarA0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design, implementation, and evaluation of a teacher training workshop for mathematics graduate teaching assistants</field><field name="creator">Trouba, Jerome Charles</field><field name="description">To help train new graduate mathematics teaching assistants (GMTAs), a teacher training workshop was designed based on K-12 literature on the components of effective professional development (Garet, et al., 2001). The workshop consisted of six two-hour seminars over a six week period followed by a classroom feedback component of either peer coaching or observation, for a total time commitment of 18 hours. The content of the workshop addressed teaching techniques specifically targeted to GMTAs. These ideas included elements of reflection, techniques for engaging students through active learning, asking good questions, utilizing wait-time, and using formative assessment techniques. The assessment of the workshop was based on Guskey's (1999) work on the five levels of effective professional development evaluation. In the mixed-methods design, 18 GMTAs participated in the workshop. Data collection consisted of three sets of videotapes, two sets of interviews, surveys, and coaching and observation forms. Results indicated that a well-designed workshop can impact teaching practices. Through interviews, GMTAs indicated they were more reflective of their teaching, thought more about the questions they asked, and actively involved their students more during lectures. The workshop was considered effective not only because GMTAs said they changed their teaching but because changes were seen in their teaching. For nine GMTAs strong evidence was collected of their change in teaching: they not only mentioned specific changes to their teaching in the interviews, but these specific changes were observed on videotapes of their classroom. In comparing peer coaching with observation, seven of the ten in the coaching group commented that just watching another's class helped them to improve more than any other part of the coaching process. Only two of the ten coaching participants commented on the helpfulness of the pre and post conference discussions involved with coaching. From the data collected, the possible added benefits of peer coaching may be outweighed by the additional time, organization, and pairing requirements present in a GMTA setting. Five constructs that influenced the effectiveness of the peer coaching experience are discussed. This project contributes to the research base regarding adapting K-12 professional development literature into a collegiate setting.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/trouba/TroubaJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of severe fire on ectomycorrhizal fungi of whitebark pine seedlings</field><field name="creator">Trusty, Paul Evan</field><field name="description">Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) is a threatened keystone species in subalpine zones of Western North America critical to watersheds and maintenance of high elevation biodiversity. Pine nuts are an important food for wildlife including grizzly bears. Whitebark pine stands have experienced losses up to 90% due to white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetles and replacement due to fire suppression. Active management strategies include letting natural fires burn or applying prescribed fires to clear understory fir, stimulate seedling regeneration and provide openings for nutcrackers to plant seeds. However, post-fire plantings of rust-resistant seedlings have low survival rates. This study evaluated the impact of fire on the mycorrhizal fungi which are obligate mutualists with whitebark pine and to address management concerns. The 2001 Fridley fire burned a portion of a mature whitebark pine forest and a year later 20,000 seedlings were planted. After four years, natural and planted seedlings, on the burn and controls in the adjacent unburned forest were well colonized by mycorrhizal fungi (&gt;90%) although a portion may be nursery E-strain. The severe burn reduced mycorrhizal diversity 27% on natural and planted seedlings and caused a significant shift in mycorrhizal species (determined by ITS sequencing, principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling). Seedlings in the burn (natural and planted) were dominated by Pseudotomentella nigra, Wilcoxina species and Amphinema byssoides while natural seedlings in unburned forest hosted mainly Cenococcum geophilum and Piloderma byssinum. Differences were minimal between planted and natural seedlings in the burn, but roots of planted pines retained the container shape. The functional significance of a species shift to seedling survival is not yet known. Seedlings in all treatments hosted suilloid fungi (Rhizopogon, Suillus) important in pine establishment. A greenhouse bioassay of burned and unburned soils using nursery seedlings did not reflect the full diversity found in the field study, but did reveal suilloid fungi indicating that bioassays can be used as a pre-planting assessment tool for this group. Despite high mycorrhization and availability of suilloids, seedling survival was low (22-42%) suggesting the timing/type of mycorrhization and/or other biotic/abiotic factors are a concern.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/trusty/TrustyP0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Importance of financial literacy and financial literacy content in curriculum</field><field name="creator">Tschache, Candice Arrington</field><field name="description">Teachers, administrators, parents, business owners, and community members need to know the importance and value of a Personal Finance class.

These rocks were displaced southwestward in Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene time along the northeast-dipping Elk Range thrust system. The thrust system trends southeast from Redstone, CO to the Fossil Ridge wilderness and includes the en echelon Elk Range and Brush Creek thrust faults. This thrust system represents the deeply eroded up-plunge core of a major Laramide basement-cored fold in western Colorado, the Grand Hogback monocline. The emergence of the thrust system from the fold's core is well documented at all scales of geologic mapping over the northwest end of the system. This surface relationship is undemonstrated in previous structural interpretations, which invoke a mechanism of gravity sliding within the sedimentary package, induced by vertical basement uplift. To the southeast a critical portion of the system had remained unmapped in any contiguous detail. This critical area exposes the basement roots of the thrust system, as it merges with the reverse-faulted southwestern margin of the Laramide Sawatch Range basement arch. This thesis presents a new structural architecture for the Elk Range thrust system through: 1) new 1:24,000 scale mapping of the emergent root zone, 2) regional balanced cross-section analysis 3) demonstration of a genetic relationship with the Grand Hogback monocline, and 4) consideration of contemporary basement-involved foreland contraction models. The fault system is a basement-rooted, right-stepping, en echelon thrust front. The Elk Range thrust sheet is truncated by high-angle reverse faults to the east and the Brush Creek thrust becomes steeper and merges with reverse faults to the southeast. The western Sawatch front shows evidence for late-stage, north-south directed contraction. Thus, the Elk Range thrust system represents an inverted segment of the western Ancestral Colorado Trough. Structurally, it represents a transitional deformation regime between fold-shortening (Grand Hogback monocline) and high-angle reverse-faulting (Sawatch arch). Together, this tectonic continuum marks Colorado's westernmost Laramide deformation front against the Colorado Plateau. Younger deformation is observed and discussed with respect to the region's dynamic transition from Laramide contraction to Rio Grande rifting.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/tully/TullyJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable isotope (18 O/16 O and D/H) studies of cascade volcanic arc magmatism</field><field name="creator">Underwood, Sandra Jean</field><field name="description">Stable isotope ratios (18 O/16 O and D/H) potentially constrain origins of magma and volatile sources in igneous rocks. Modification of magmas by closed system processes (fractional crystallization and closed system devolatilization) or open-system processes (assimilation and fractional crystallization, magma mixing, degassing) affect 18 O/16 O and D/H ratios in known ways. Magma degassing during volcanic eruptions and subsequent rehydration or alteration of groundmass glass reduces accuracy of whole rock stable isotope measurements, the traditional method of measuring glassy volcanic rocks. However, phenocrysts separated from fresh volcanic rocks may retain magmatic 18 O/16 O and D/H values. Accordingly, oxygen isotopes in olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase crystals were measured to determine whether Quaternary little-evolved mafic lavas of the Southernmost Cascades (SMC) represent only melts of heterogeneously contaminated mantle sources. In variably degassed silicic volcanic rocks from the 1980-1986 eruptions at Mount St. Helens (MSH) and the 1915 eruptions at Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC), hydrogen isotopes in amphibole and biotite phenocrysts were measured to evaluate shallow subvolcano magmatic processes. Magmas in each study are strongly influenced by crustal stress fields associated with each tectonic setting. The mantle source of the SMC little-evolved mafic lavas is heterogeneous, but these continental arc magmas acquire crustal contamination that reflects vent location across a region of extended heterogeneous crust. Hydrous phenocrysts in comparatively shallow, sill-like LVC silicic magma bodies recorded heating and devolatilization associated with the periodic injections of mafic magma. The broadly distributed crustal extension enables crystallizing silicic magmas to devolatilize as they are variably remobilized by heat and volatiles of recharging mafic magmas. At MSH, numerous small dacite magma pulses crowded into the narrow extensional volume below the vent. This focusing of all magmas and exsolved volatiles from a deeper main magma body produced the explosive May 18, 1980, eruption that also extensively damaged at least the upper 5 km of subvolcano plumbing. Through 1986, pulses of volatile-rich dacite magma degassed in a structurally and thermally evolving plumbing system.

Unused quantities of nitrocellulose (NC), another explosive, have also been accumulating at ammunitions manufacturing facilities. Transformation of both TNT and NC to non-explosive compounds has been studied using either chemical or biological approaches, each with limited success. With respect to TNT, the use of alkaline hydrolysis (degradation at high pH) as a chemical treatment had been tested at room temperature (20&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C) under conditions where the hydroxide concentration exceeded that of TNT (pH &gt; 10). These high hydroxide conditions were not directly amenable to biological treatment of the hydrolysis products. This study found that alkaline hydrolysis was effective for complete degradation of TNT at elevated temperatures (60&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C and 80&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C) when the concentration of TNT was less than the hydroxide concentration (pH 9 and 10). The resulting solution, or hydrolysate, contained no TNT. This hydrolysate was used as the carbon and nitrogen source for an aerobic bacterial enrichment from the Bozeman wastewater treatment plant. With respect to NC, the back-log of accumulated NC necessitates a degradation method that will process high NC concentrations (200g/L). Alkaline hydrolysis at 60&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C was used with very high hydroxide concentrations to rapidly degrade high concentrations of NC, producing high nitrate and nitrite concentrations. The NC hydrolysate was neutralized and spiked into a denitrifying culture which was able to reduce both nitrate and nitrite. The goal of this work was to develop a dual component chemical-biological system for complete degradation of the explosives TNT and NC, which was achieved using alkaline hydrolysis as the chemical component and bacterial wastewater treatment enrichments as the biological component.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/vanengelen/VanengelenC1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular aspects of uranium toxicity: speciation and physiological targeting</field><field name="creator">VanEngelen, Michael Robert</field><field name="description">Uranium (U), as the uranyl ion (UO 2 &amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm;), is a widely distributed contaminant at several Department of Energy (DOE) sites, former war zones, and across the globe.

Recent trends suggest that U-related activity will increase in the near future, and therefore understanding fundamental interactions between UO 2 &amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;ordm; and living systems is both an environmental and human health imperative.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/vanengelen/VanEngelenM1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-efficacy development of aspiring principals in education leadership preparation programs</field><field name="creator">Versland, Tena Marie</field><field name="description">Much attention has been given to the importance of principal preparation programs in equipping principals with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively lead schools. However despite this attention, many critics from inside and outside the higher education community do not believe preparation programs have gone far enough or have made the necessary changes to insure that principal candidates gain the skills and knowledge necessary for the demands of leadership in contemporary schools. Bandura (1997) found that people's self-efficacy, the judgments of their personal capabilities, rather than their actual skills and knowledge, is what drives them to achieve goals they set for themselves. Since little research exists that examines principal self-efficacy, or how preparation programs contribute to self-efficacy, preparation program faculty have limited understanding about how program elements positively influence self-efficacy development. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to: examine principals' perceptions of the effectiveness of their preparation programs, determine the underlying factors that contributed to principal self-efficacy, understand how program elements contributed to self-efficacy, and suggest ways that preparation programs might more purposefully design experiences that promote self-efficacy development in aspiring principals. Quantitative questionnaires were sent to 538 practicing principals in Montana to rate the effectiveness of their preparation programs and their principal self-efficacy. Principals who rated their programs as effective and who also rated themselves as self-efficacious were chosen for qualitative interviews to determine how preparation program elements contributed to their self-efficacy development. The findings suggest that: (a) four factors - leadership experiences, motivation, authentic learning experiences, and self regulation contributed to self-efficacy development of aspiring principals; (b) self-efficacy was developed through experiences that caused relationship building and learning from others, authentic experiences working with others and persistence and perseverance; (c) preparation programs can more purposefully create efficacy building experiences through: designing experiences that cause students to master the art of working with other people, developing internship and field experiences of breadth and depth, encouraging principal candidates to obtain prior leadership experiences, and to monitor students in "grow your own" programs to insure that loss of self-efficacy does not occur as a result of broken relationships.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/versland/VerslandT0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kyoto: art in nature habitat</field><field name="creator">von Wiedersperg, Carolina Sophie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to find architectural solutions which apply the theoretical findings centered around the biophilia hypothesis.

Shifting standards occurs when people use stereotypes (e.g. gender and athleticism) to make a relative judgment about performance or behavior. Whereas past research has examined shifting standards from the perceiver's perspective, the current project investigates shifting standards from the target's perspective. To inform our hypotheses, we relied on stereotype threat literature (Stone et al., 1999) and the motivational model for stereotyped tasks (Smith, Sansone &amp; White, 2007). Using athletics as the stereotyped domain, Study 1 demonstrated that the masculine nature of the domain was important in predicting reactions to shifting standards feedback. In addition, there was a positive relationship between stigma consciousness and domain identification. In Study 2, college students and community participants were recruited using a pre-screen questionnaire assessing domain identification and primary sport played. As a result, self-identified women athletes (n = 77, 15.6% community) were blocked on the masculine nature of the sport, resulting in a 2 (type of sport: masculine, non-masculine) x 3 (feedback: positive, shifting standards, no feedback) between-subjects design. After first engaging in an ambiguous athletic test, participants received the feedback manipulation. Participants were presented with a "word puzzle" and completed a measure of gender stereotype activation. Then, a second unambiguous test was administered to measure performance, and participants completed post-test measures assessing interest, future motivation, and self-esteem. The athletic tasks were ostensibly assessing the sport each woman most identified with, but all participants actually received the same two tests. The proposed relationship between feedback, performance, and motivation was unaffected by type of sport. Explanations are provided for why this relationship was not supported. Instead, stigma consciousness moderated the effect of feedback on performance and motivation. Women high in stigma consciousness receiving shifting standards feedback showed high gender stereotype activation, low performance, and low interest compared to women high in stigma consciousness receiving positive feedback. These results were not due to participants' self-esteem or level of commitment to the test. Theoretical and practical implications for the experience of shifting standards are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/wagaman/WagamanJ0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a Raman laser pump source capable of generating flexible pulse durations while maintaining high spatial quality</field><field name="creator">Wagemann, Stephen Scott</field><field name="description">A detailed characterization of a Raman pump laser throughout the construction process is reported. Due to specific requirements for the pulsed Raman experiment, there were no commercially available pump lasers capable of meeting our specifications. The pump source must produce high energy pulses of 50mJ to 100mJ with variable duration centered at 200ns. To create this pump source, the pulses are gated from a CW source and then amplified with a high gain Nd:YAG amplification system. High spatial quality is also a necessity as the laser needs to be coupled into a small diameter waveguide functioning as the Raman cell. The laser was found to operate well, producing the required energy with the desired pulse flexibility. However, the amplification process induced spatial distortion that effectively produced a super Gaussian intensity distribution.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/wagemann/WagemannS0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An economic analysis of variable rate nitrogen management on dryland spring wheat in Northern Montana</field><field name="creator">Whitmus, Jeffrey Donald</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to compare hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield (agronomic returns) and grain value (economic returns) of variable rate and uniform nitrogen (N) management using a data set obtained from eight on-farm experiments conducted over an eleven year period (1994-2004). Field experiments were established near Simpson, Malta, Havre, and Highwood, Montana using a strip trial design where N rates were varied in replicated strips along the length of each field. A digital elevation model was created for each field site using survey quality global positioning system data. Digital elevation models were segregated into four landscape classes or management zones (Upper Slopes, Middle North Facing Slopes, Middle South Facing Slopes, and Lower Slopes) using global information system software. Geo-referenced grid soil samples were collected at each field site location to determine background soil N levels. Geo-referenced yield and protein samples were collected at all field sites using a production sized combine equipped with yield monitor. The economic analysis consisted of partial budget analysis where only the changes in costs and revenues between variable rate and uniform N management were considered as part of net returns. In addition, spatial least squares (SLS) analysis was used as the basis for establishing whether wheat yields from variable rate N management were significantly greater than those from uniform N management. The SLS analysis failed to detect a significant difference in grain yield between variable rate and uniform N management. Variable N management used more fertilizer N and was less profitable than uniform N management in seven of the eight cases. Revenues from variable N management were insufficient to offset associated costs for needed information, hardware, and software. However, if Environmental Quality Incentive Program payments of $34.57 were considered as part of net income then variable rate N management was more profitable in all cases. Little evidence existed in this study that variable rate N management improves agronomic returns and profits, or reduces N use, especially in water limited conditions found in northern Montana.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/whitmus/WhitmusJ1209.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishment and seed production of native forbs used in restoration</field><field name="creator">Wiese, Jessica Linsay</field><field name="description">The importance of incorporating native wildflowers into seed mixtures for disturbed land revegetation projects is widely known and accepted. However, further assessment of weed management approaches is a necessary step to successfully establish and produce native wildflower seed. We examined the impact of pre and post-emergence herbicides alone and in combination with hand weeding on 5 wildflower species [slender white prairie clover (Dalea candida(Michx). ex Willd), blanketflower (Gaillardia aristata Pursh), fuzzy tongue penstemon (Penstemon eriantherus Pursh var. eriantherus), silverleaf phacelia (Phacelia hastata Douglas ex Lehm.), and prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnifera (Nutt.) Woot. &amp; Standl)] under greenhouse and field conditions. Herbicides evaluated included Treflan (trifluralin) 189 l/ha, Lorox (linuron) 1.121 kg/ha., Permit (halsulfuron) 91 g/ha., Plateau (imazapic) 560 g/ha, and Prowl (pendimethalin) 4.2 l/ha. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine wildflower seedling tolerance to post-emergence herbicides, 2) evaluate the effect of pre-and post-emergence herbicides on native wildflower seedling establishment, weed control, and wildflower seed production. For objective 1 a randomized block design was used and repeated twice. A Monte Carlo resampling assessed herbicide damage and a randomized block design analysis of variance (ANOVA) assessed herbicide impact on fresh and dry biomass. Results indicated that the D. candida and R. columnifera were minimally affected by herbicide treatments, while G. aristata and P. hastata were strongly affected, the first by linuron and halosulfuron and the last by halosulfuron and imazapic. Objective 2 assessed hand weeding and pre and postemergence herbicide effects on native wildflowers. A randomized block design was used to assess wildflower establishment, percentage cover, yield, and seed germination and viability, along with weed community composition and cover as a function of weed management approach. Data were analyzed with a randomized block design analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for differences in wildflowers seedling emergence, percent cover of wildflowers, and seed yield. Wildflower species responded uniquely to weed management, indicating caution should be used when applying herbicides to the tested species. Specifically, emergence of P. eriantherus, D. candida and P. hastata were negatively affected by trifluralin, indicating this herbicide may not be suited for the tested wildflowers.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/wiese/WieseJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biostimulatory effect of bulls on postpartum follicular wave development in postpartum, anestrous, suckled beef cows</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Jarrod Robert Charles</field><field name="description">The objective of this experiment was to determine if bull exposure influences follicular wave dynamics in primiparous, postpartum, anestrous, suckled, beef cows exposed to bulls. In Experiment 1, cows were exposed (continuously 24 h/d), (EB; n = 5) to bulls or not exposed to bulls (NE; n = 5) throughout the experimental period. In Experiment 2, cows were exposed to bulls for either 12 h, (EB12; n = 15), 6 h, (EB6; n =14) or not exposed to bulls (NE; n = 10) from the start to the end of the experimental period. In Experiments 1 and 2, cows were 67 d &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 3.8 (mean &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; SE) and 51.5 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 2.3 d postpartum at the start of the experiment. Follicular characteristics of each cow were examined by transrectal ultrasonography. In Experiment 1, interwave interval for wave 3 was shorter in EB than NE cows. Maximum dominant follicle (MDF) diameter tended to be greater during wave 2 for EB than NE cows, while wave 3 was greater for EB than NE cows. However, MDF diameter for wave 6 was greater for NE than EB cows. In Experiment 2, EB12 cows had fewer follicular waves to the resumption of luteal activity (RLA) than NE cows, while the number of waves to RLA for EB6 cows did not differ from that of EB12 or NE cows. Normalizing follicular waves to the time of RLA for cows within the EB12 and EB6 indicated that those cows at RLA had larger MDF diameters for the wave that produced the ovulatory follicle than cows that did not RLA. These data show the effects of bull exposure in altering follicular growth and developmental patterns, shortening the inter-wave interval and increasing the MDF diameter. Though the mechanism through which bull exposure alters postpartum follicular development is not entirely understood, these data provide new understanding.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/wilkinson/WilkinsonJ0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining hydrodynamic modeling with nonthermal test particle tracking to improve flare simulations</field><field name="creator">Winter, Henry deGraffenried III</field><field name="description">Solar flares remain a subject of intense study in the solar physics community. These huge releases of energy on the Sun have direct consequences for humans on Earth and in space. The processes that impart tremendous amounts of energy are not well understood. In order to test theoretical models of flare formation and evolution, state of the art, numerical codes must be created that can accurately simulate the wide range of electromagnetic radiation emitted by flares. A direct comparison of simulated radiation to increasingly detailed observations will allow scientists to test the validity of theoretical models. To accomplish this task, numerical codes were developed that can simulate both the thermal and nonthermal components of a flaring plasma, their interactions, and their emissions. The HYLOOP code combines a hydrodynamic equation solver with a nonthermal particle tracking code in order to simulate the thermal and nonthermal aspects of a flare. A solar flare was simulated using this new code with a static atmosphere and with a dynamic atmosphere, to illustrate the importance of considering hydrodynamic effects on nonthermal beam evolution. The importance of density gradients in the evolution of nonthermal electron beams was investigated by studying their effects in isolation. The importance of the initial pitch-angle cosine distribution to flare dynamics was investigated. Emission in XRT filters were calculated and analyzed to see if there were soft X-ray signatures that could give clues to the nonthermal particle distributions. Finally the HXR source motions that appeared in the simulations were compared to real observations of this phenomena.</field><field name="date">2009-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/winter/WinterH0509.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effects of completion problems on introductory physics students</field><field name="creator">Wolf, Jeremy Tyler</field><field name="description">In this study the completion problems were voluntary.

We have created a bivalent lectincarbohydrate binding system using dendrimers as the carbohydrate mounted scaffold and Concanavalin A (Con A) as the mannose/glucose binding lectin to investigate this mode of interaction. The relative affinities of the utilized carbohydrates toward Con A are: mannose binds 4 times stronger than glucose, and galactose shows no affinity. With these relative affinities in hand and changing the ratios of mannose, glucose and galactose on the periphery of the PAMAM dendrimer scaffold, we have made a predictable and tuneable system with which to control the polyvalent binding relative affinity. By changing the carbohydrate presentation and varying the size of PAMAM dendrimer used, we can tune the affinity between two orders of magnitude. Although the relative affinities can be predictably altered, the clustering ability across the same generation dendrimer is not affected. In exploring more complex lectin : carbohydrate systems we have made a library of lactose, galactose and galNAc functionalized dendrimers to study binding to galectin-3. This lectin is implicated in numerous cancer related pathway, cellular proliferation and apoptosis. An ELISA based assay was developed to gain binding information of this intruiging interaction. The assay results suggest a reduced effect of binding association even with a large range of monomeric affinities, indicating a multivalent system. The monomer affinities did however affect the lectin recruitment to the dendrimers adsorbed onto a surface. The report here indicated a delicate interplay of modes of multivalent binding that dictate the biological behavior of this important galactose binding lectin.</field><field name="date">2009-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2009/wolfenden/WolfendenM0809.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of alternative crops for management of Pratylenchus neglectus in Montana winter wheat production</field><field name="creator">Zuck, Peter Christopher</field><field name="description">A series of crop rotations were evaluated for their impacts on soil-borne populations of root lesion nematodes, Pratylenchus neglectus.

The antenna arrays also have the ability to detect the direction of incoming signals. These two capabilities allow a smart antenna system to adaptively beamform to more efficiently communicate between nodes. The direction-of-arrival estimation is a crucial component of the smart antenna system that uses open-loop adaptive approach. Historically this estimation has been accomplished using a personal computer. Implementing the estimation in the digital domain has the potential to provide a low cost and light weight solution due to recent advances in digital integrated circuit fabrication processes. Furthermore, digital circuitry allows for more sophisticated estimation algorithms to be implemented using the computational power of modern digital devices. This thesis presents the design and prototyping of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for a smart antenna system implemented on a reconfigurable digital hardware fabric. Two DOA estimation algorithms are implemented and the performance tradeoffs between a custom hardware approach and a microprocessor-based system are compared. The algorithms were implemented for a 5.8 GHz, 8-element circular antenna array and their functionality was verified using a testbed platform. The implementation and analysis presented in this work will aid system designers to understand the tradeoffs between implementing algorithms in custom hardware versus an embedded system and when a hybrid approach is more advantageous.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/abusultan/AbusultanM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experience of night shift registered nurses in an acute care setting: a phenomenological study</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Valerie Valdez</field><field name="description">The night shift environment in acute care nursing is a unique and poorly understood entity. Retention of experienced nurses on the night shift is vital to the provision of quality care and the nurturing of new nurses. The goal of this phenomenological study was to elicit a description of the lived experience of experienced night shift nurses with the goal of gleaning information that would improve the work environment on the night shift. Five experienced night shift RNs participated in self-directed interviews, responding to the question, "Can you please share your experiences as an RN working the night shift?" The interview data were analyzed using Giorgi's phenomenological method to arrive at a typical and essential structure of the experience. The results revealed negative and positive aspects of working a night shift schedule. Negative aspects of night shift nursing included a feeling of being misunderstood and undervalued professionally and personally. Inadequate resources, on the night shift, was also identified as a barrier to nurse satisfaction, and negatively influencing the provision of quality nursing care and quality orientation of new nurses. Negative physiologic influences of night shift centered around poor quality and quantity of sleep. While these negative influences were consistently presented by all participants, so were the positive aspects of night shift nursing. The participants of this study were strongly invested in the teamwork they experienced within their night shift work environment. Interdependent team spirit was found to have arisen in response to the lack of resources experienced by these nurses. This teamwork, along with the other positive aspects, such as autonomous practice and positive effects on personal time, were seen as incentives for these experienced nurses to continue nursing on the night shift. Nursing administration may be able to utilize the information gleaned from this study to optimize the night shift work environment, and subsequently, increase retention of the experienced nurse. Further research is needed to clarify: the needs of experienced nurses in varying clinical settings, the needs of inexperienced night shift nurses, and the representativeness of the data found in this study to larger numbers of nurses.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/anderson/AndersonV0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project FRESH</field><field name="creator">Aune, Matthew David</field><field name="description">Project FRESH is about creating a sustainable food system for our future.

One of the fading distributions is Ricean distribution that assumes a line of sight signal and an infinite number of multipath signals between the transmitter and the receiver. The key parameter in the Ricean distribution is the K factor which is a measure of the severity of fading; the lower the K value, the more severe the fading. The problem was to develop a hardware based fading simulator that is based on the Ricean distribution. The key component of the hardware is an eight channel beamformer board; each channel has a 6-bit attenuator and a 6-bit phase shifter controlled by a on board FPGA for beamforming purpose. To approximate the Ricean fading, one of the eight channels was designated the line of sight signal, and the seven other channels were used to emulate the multipath signals. Cables with different lengths were used as delay lines to emulate the actual delays that occur to the multipath signals. The signals were then normalized to account for the cable losses. The fade simulator was controlled using a MATLAB program that sent a serial bit stream to the attenuators and phase shifters on the beamformer board. The MATLAB program generated random attenuations and phase shifts according to the Ricean distribution for the inputted K value. For a constant amplitude input RF signal, as K was increased, the fluctuation in the signal at the output of the fade simulator decreased. The estimated K values from the collected data were close to the inputted K values. The probability density functions (PDFs), the cumulative density functions (CDFs) and the level crossing rates (LCRs) of the collected data compared closely to the theoretical Ricean fading distribution PDFs, CDFs and LCRs, which showed that the fade simulator provides an accurate simulation of Ricean fading. The fade simulator was used to evaluate the performance of Airspan and Harris radios. The throughput of the radios was tested under different K values and for different SNR. As K increased, the fluctuation in the signal decreased which led to higher throughput.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/badawy/BadawyA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a phenomena-oriented architecture</field><field name="creator">Baggett, Neal Stuart</field><field name="description">Architecture&amp;acirc;&#8364;&#8482;s focus on the visual faculty omits potential dialogue with the tactile, auditory and proprioceptive ones.

One major issue that limits the ability of the material from being used directly as an actuator is the large, non-recoverable strains likely to accrue in the material during each training cycle, mechanical or thermal. When mechanical or thermal cycling is performed, a hysteresis curve develops and reaches a steady state strain recovery response. At the point where permanent plastic strain stops growing, or saturates, the SMA has been successfully trained. The focus of this work is oriented toward SMAs in general, but all testing and experimentation was carried out on Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) alloys. The experimentation and testing was performed on a combination of 4 different sizes and 3 different NiTi alloy compositions. Thermomechanical testing was performed to determine critical values to describe the stress-temperature phase space of the materials and parameters to model the applied stress and transformation strain relationship. All material size and alloy combinations were tested in the as-received, or as-machined, and fully annealed state. The results of the training and actuation strain characterization process developed in this work shows that the samples that experienced Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP), greater than 2% during the training process and exhibit Two-Way Shape Memory (TWSM) after being fully trained, share a very similar applied stress versus transformation strain curve. This curve is modeled by the Back Stress formulation derived from the Gibbs Free Energy constitutive model by Bo &amp; Lagoudas. The design space created by the Back Stress formulation, recrystallization temperature, and training stress allows SMA materials to be characterized and implemented as stable 1-D actuators. This research formalized a thermomechanical training and characterization method for uniaxial SMA actuators by addressing the interaction between processing, recoverable and non-recoverable deformation. Using various sizes and NiTi alloy combinations, this research develops and evaluates a method to train and characterize a diverse range of SMAs through a set of thermomechanical and physical property measurements.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/becker/BeckerM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crop diversification and technology adoption: the role of market isolation in Ethiopia</field><field name="creator">Bittinger, Alison Kay</field><field name="description">The supply of basic necessities, primarily food, in developing countries is an ongoing concern. A crucial component to improving this situation is access to information on the decision environment and behavior of smallholders in these countries. One challenge facing agricultural households is the lack of effective access for input and output markets. The markets that do exist often fail to facilitate efficient trade between buyers and sellers. Smallholders are forced to adjust their production behavior to compensate for this lack of market access. The purpose of this paper is to examine the crop diversification and technology adoption decisions made by households, in relation to their distance and, by implication, lack of access to a market center. This thesis uses a dataset that contains information on the production systems of Ethiopian smallholders in 2000/2001. The focus of the analysis is on the determinants of chemical fertilizer adoption, crop diversification levels, and crop choices. A simultaneous equation model is used to obtain estimates for the decisions to adopt chemical fertilizer and diversify crop mix in which the endogenous variables are truncated. In addition, a system of five OLS equations is used to explain the shares of land devoted to major categories of crops (primary staple crops; cereals/pulses; oils/spices; fruits/vegetables; and cash crops). The empirical results indicate that Ethiopian smallholders do react to changes in the level of market access by altering their production behavior.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/bittinger/BittingerA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communication and information exchange in Libby, Montana: a secondary data analysis of community advisory group meeting summaries</field><field name="creator">Blata-Pennock, Natasha Nicole</field><field name="description">Residents of the rural town of Libby, Montana are impacted by what has been called the worst case of community wide asbestos exposure in United States history. Over a decade after cleanup of the asbestos-contaminated vermiculite began, Libby area residents continue to experience the related aftermath of widespread asbestos exposure, including asbestos-related disease (ARD) and other chronic illnesses, an ongoing environmental cleanup effort and the conduct of multiple research studies. Effective communication is an essential element of trust and confidence in community-based activities. Although the Libby Community Advisory Group (CAG) was established as a two-way forum for communication and information exchange between the community and agencies involved in providing services to the community, little is known about the community's preferred modes of communication and the community's awareness, knowledge, acceptance and resistance to biomedical and behavioral research. The purpose of this study was to identify concerns, perceptions and preferences of Libby area residents related to research communication, information exchange and other issues pertinent to the community's health and well-being. A retrospective, qualitative analysis of CAG meeting summaries was conducted to identify themes that could lead to a better understanding of critical communication issues between community members and health service providers, policymakers, researchers and agencies involved with the environmental investigation and cleanup of the Libby area. A total of 53 meeting summaries from four years (2001, 2003, 2006 &amp; 2008) representing seminal events in the community were examined. Eleven primary topics of discussion emerged from the data. Libby residents use a variety of communication and information exchange methods, including letters, newspapers and CAG meetings. Face-to-face communication is valued by the community. The community generally has a positive and supportive view of research, and coordination between researchers and local healthcare providers is important to community members. Rural traits and concepts were present in the CAG meetings, including independence, self-reliance, hardiness/resilience, distance/isolation and insider/outsider. Results support research in the Libby community, and emphasize the importance of communication of research opportunities, updates and results and the coordination of research activities with local healthcare agencies. Implications for practice and future research also are presented.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/blata-pennock/Blata-PennockN0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FAME: Families Achieving Mathematical Excellence: the process of developing a family involvement program for a Western rural middle school serving American Indian students</field><field name="creator">Bollinger, Susan Marie</field><field name="description">Family is an important element in the cultural identity of this American Indian community so involving families in the education of their children is crucial. This mixed methods study documents the process of implementing a family involvement program at a rural school serving predominantly low-income families near an American Indian reservation. The results showed there is a strong sense of responsibility among the parents for the education of their children. Parents and students were found to work together to improve their learning by reviewing homework together and doing learning activities at home. Interview data stressed the importance of developing a welcoming learning environment at school and at afterschool events that is culturally sensitive. Families need to feel they are welcomed and respected. The structure of afterschool events must be flexible and familiar for continued participation. Facilitators of family involvement programs in American Indian communities need to design programs that are culturally responsive to the local tribe and community, supporting the comfort and learning of the participants, providing materials for everyone to take home, and bringing the program to the people.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/bollinger/BollingerS0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stroke education packet: the inpatient environment</field><field name="creator">Brandt, Heidi Kay</field><field name="description">Stroke is a disease process that affects more than 700,000 people per year. Many of those individuals enter the acute care setting with questions and concerns regarding the causes of stroke and implications of a stroke diagnosis. To answer those questions, national guidelines regarding stroke education have been created to help nurses present information to stroke patients and their families. In one acute care facility, there was a lack of an educational packet for nurses to use to teach this vital information. The purpose of this clinical project was to create an evidence-based stroke education packet for nurses at this facility to use to teach stroke patients and their families. Evidence was compiled from the literature, evidence-based guidelines, and multiple stroke-education packets, brochures, and patient education materials used by nurses at other health care facilities. The packet was created and presented to the institution as a usable tool to facilitate the delivery and documentation of stroke education to patients and their families.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/brandt/BrandtH0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental conditions affecting the efficiency and efficacy of piscicides for use in non-native fish eradication</field><field name="creator">Brown, Peter James</field><field name="description">Conservation of native fish is a pressing issue for fisheries managers. Conservation efforts often require eliminating threats posed by nonnative fish by eradicating them with piscicides. The piscicides rotenone and antimycin are used for eradication but their application is often inefficient or ineffective. My goal was to increase the efficiency and efficacy of nonnative fish eradication using piscicides. I identified environmental conditions affecting piscicide application, researched methods to overcome these problems, and provided tools that piscicide applicators can use to make piscicide application more efficient and effective. Rotenone and antimycin were exposed to varying levels of sunlight, turbulence, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to determine the effect these environmental conditions have on piscicides. Bioassay fish were used to determine the toxicity of the piscicides. Sunlight and turbulence affected rotenone and antimycin but DOM did not. Increasing the concentration of chemical can increase the resistance to the effects of these environmental conditions; however, the effects of these conditions are considerable in natural settings. Observations of bioassay fish in stream applications of rotenone were used to develop a statistical model to predict the persistence of the piscicide. The model can be used to predict rotenone persistence in small montane streams and to estimate where rotenone concentrations need to be fortified. I measured the mixing rate of a chemical plume in different channel morphologies and at center or edge applications. Center application had a significantly shorter mixing distance than edge application, but mixing distance was not different among meandering, straight, and riffle/pool morphologies. Application of my findings will increase the efficiency and efficacy of native fish conservation using piscicides.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/brown/BrownP0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of natural avalanche activity associated with new snow water equivalance and upper atmospheric wind direction and speed in the mountains surrounding Gothic, Colorado</field><field name="creator">Chesley-Preston, Tara Lea</field><field name="description">Snowfall, temperature and wind are three factors that quickly change avalanche conditions. Ridge-top winds have been used to assess avalanche conditions with mixed success due to high variability. Few analyses have tested the effect upper atmospheric winds have on avalanche conditions. This study attempts to quantify the effect upper atmospheric wind direction and speed have on the spatial pattern of natural avalanching in the mountains near Gothic, Colorado. The Gothic dataset consists of over 3,300 natural avalanches spanning a time period of 33 years. These data are associated with daily new snow water equivalence (SWE) collected at Gothic, as well as 500mb wind direction and speed from the National Centers for Environmental Protection/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) gridded reanalysis project. I hypothesize that prevailing 500mb winds are more likely to be associated with natural avalanches in avalanche paths with a starting zone aspect lee to the prevailing free air winds. In addition, I hypothesize that the odds of a natural avalanche occurring increases with increasing new SWE, increasing 500mb wind speeds, and 500mb wind direction. These hypotheses are tested using simple probability analysis as well as a two-component hurdle model. As expected, avalanche paths lee to the 500mb wind direction have an increased probability of avalanching in relation to paths facing in other directions. However, exceptions do occur, some of which can be explained by cross-loading. The hurdle model results indicate that after accounting for new SWE, 500mb wind speed is significant in determining whether or not a day will be considered an avalanche day. Once a day is determined to be an avalanche day, 500mb wind direction is an important determinant for the daily avalanche hazard after accounting for new SWE. These results have practical significance. They give avalanche forecasters confidence that upper air wind direction is a useful predictor of the pattern of avalanche activity at the valley or mountain range scale, and the exceptions observed show that such predictions cannot be applied at the path scale. These scale issues demonstrate the general nature of backcountry advisories and why they cannot be applied at the scale of individual slopes.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/chesley-preston/Chesley-PrestonT0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Object and spatial recognition in the ischemic gerbil</field><field name="creator">Clement, Bridget Williams</field><field name="description">The Mongolian gerbil is extensively used to model transient cerebral ischemia, a type of stroke that can occur with anoxia and cardiac arrest. A global ischemic insult in the gerbil produces damage to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells comparable to that observed in humans. A limited number of models are available to evaluate the behavioral consequences of cerebral ischemia in the gerbil. The goal of the present experiments was to evaluate the impact of transient cerebral ischemia on object and spatial recognition memory as these tasks have not been previously utilized with the gerbil model. Following ischemic insult (5-min bilateral carotid occlusion) or sham procedure, gerbils were tested in a familiar environment with novel objects. A familiarization phase followed by separate test phases for presentations of a novel object or object location were conducted. Exploratory behavior for the novel object or object location was evaluated using an automated tracking system. Results indicated that both ischemic and sham subjects were able to recognize the novel object when placed in the environment. However, when confronted with a familiar object, placed in a novel location, neither group exhibited a significant increase in exploratory behavior. A second experiment was conducted to further investigate the spatial recognition task. Subjects were habituated to the apparatus in addition to the experimental objects. Under this experimental condition, both groups exhibited significant exploratory behavior for the object placed in the novel location. The ischemic and control groups differed from each other during habituation with ischemic subject showing significantly higher activity levels. It is possible that differences between the groups remain but that these recognition findings are a result of extended habituation to the experimental objects. Further investigation of this matter is needed to determine the effect of prior object exposure on exploratory behavior in the spatial recognition task.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/clement/ClementB0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postpartum depression: a comparison of military and civilian population</field><field name="creator">Coburn, Brittany Jean</field><field name="description">After careful review of the literature, a gap exists regarding the prevalence of postpartum depression in the military population compared with the civilian population. It is currently estimated that postpartum depression affects 13% of the childbearing population and over 50% of cases go unnoticed. The purpose of this study was to determine if a higher prevalence of postpartum depression exists in women married to active duty military members compared with women married to members of the general population in rural northwestern Montana. A sample population of 27 women from rural northwestern Montana completed the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS) and their results were compared with those from a comparative population of 54 women married to active duty military members from southern Georgia. The PDSS short form was used and consists of seven questions with a Likert type scoring. The possible scores ranged from seven to 35 and a score of greater than 14 indicated that the woman had symptoms of depression. Data were analyzed and the average score and the prevalence rate were determined for each population. The average score for the civilian population was 16.85 with a prevalence rate of 62.96% compared with the military population's average score of 13.7 and prevalence rate of 50%. Demographic data was also collected and analyzed. The prevalence rate for the civilian population from rural northwestern Montana was greater than for the population of women married to active duty military members. Both populations had a greater than average prevalence rate. Possible limitations to the study include a small sample size, the data were collected from different time periods and different geographic areas, economic instability was increasing for the sampling of rural women, rural women were screened in the winter months, and there is limited research regarding the rural woman and postpartum depression.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/coburn/CoburnB0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of an invasive lake trout population in Swan Lake, Montana</field><field name="creator">Cox, Benjamin Samuel</field><field name="description">The recent invasion of lake trout into the Swan River drainage in Northwest Montana threatens one of the last remaining recreational bull trout fisheries in the USA. An inter-agency group is implementing an experimental lake trout suppression program on Swan Lake. The objectives of this study were to establish a baseline data set on the lake trout population in Swan Lake concurrently with the experimental removal effort, simulate alternative management scenarios using matrix models and identify spawning locations of lake trout to target adult fish and embryos. A commercial gill-net sampling effort provided data to estimate abundance, size structure, age structure, growth, condition, maturity, fecundity, and mortality of lake trout in Swan Lake. Lake trout in Swan Lake grew rapidly, attained large sizes, and were in high condition. The size and age structure of lake trout sampled was skewed towards juvenile lake trout, indicating the population was growing rapidly. Matrix-model simulations also indicated the lake trout population would continue to grow with no suppression efforts, but suppression efforts could reduce the population growth rate. Population growth was particularly sensitive to changes in age-0 survival in population models. Elasticity analysis of matrix simulations indicated survival from birth to sexual maturity, followed by survival of adult fish contributed most to population growth. Lake trout spawning locations were identified using ultrasonic telemetry, short-set gill nets, and in-situ egg nets. Spawning locations identified with acoustic telemetry were confirmed by capturing gravid lake trout in gill nets and lake trout eggs in the substrate. These results suggest that the inter-agency group should focus removal efforts on sub-adult and adult lake trout at if extirpation of the population is the goal. Given the uncertainty in the vital rates and the potential bias in exploitation rates used to model suppression scenarios, annual suppression efforts should be increased from the 2008 level to ensure a decline in the lake trout population.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/cox/CoxB0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient allocation to egg formation of lesser scaup</field><field name="creator">Cutting, Kyle Anthony</field><field name="description">Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) populations have declined for nearly three-decades. Recent evidence suggests that decreases in habitat quality and availability of spring staging areas may have resulted in a decline of recruitment. Recently, stable isotopes analysis has emerged as a powerful ecological tool to measure the degree of cross-seasonal effects of birds. In 2006 through 2008 in southwestern Montana, I used carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) stable isotopes to assess how red blood cells (RBC), which is a proxy for stored body reserves (endogenous), change over time as local foods (exogenous) are consumed, and to estimate the relative contributions of endogenous reserves and exogenous foods for egg formation. From arrival through the egg laying period, 15N values of RBC decreased while 13C values became more stable, a pattern consistent with expectations of endogenous tissues equilibrating with local dietary sources. In 2006 and 2008, isotopic values for egg albumen and yolk protein were similar to those expected from local dietary sources, which indicated that most protein used for producing egg albumen and yolk protein was obtained on the breeding grounds (exogenous sources). In 2007, endogenous reserves contributed on average 26% and 10% more for producing albumen and yolk protein, respectively, than in 2006 and 2008 combined. Due to small differences in 13C values between female endogenous lipids upon arrival to the breeding grounds and those of local invertebrate lipids, it was not possible to separately estimate the contributions of endogenous and invertebrate lipids to egg lipid formation. My results suggest that local invertebrates and endogenous lipid reserves contributed on average 51% (SE = 7%) to egg lipid production. The remaining contributions to eggs were derived from local seed sources. Despite recent findings of reduced endogenous reserves during spring migration, results from the females in this study suggest that the amount of time that females spend on the breeding grounds prior to nest initiation may be adequate in some years to allow them to attain adequate exogenous foods for reproduction. Future isotopic research is now needed across latitudinal gradients, allowing length of prebreeding season to vary, while separating out the contribution from endogenous versus exogenous sources.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/cutting/CuttingK0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sense of memory</field><field name="creator">Dale, Jolene Marie</field><field name="description">Throughout this thesis three main categories will be addressed. Memory: a: the power or process of reproducing or recalling what has been learned and retained especially through associative mechanisms b: the store of things learned and retained from an organism's activity or experience as evidence by modification of structure or behavior or by recall or recognition&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; Sense: a: the faculty of perceiving by means of sense organs b: a specialized function or mechanism (as sight, hearing, smell, taste or touch) by which an animal receives and responds to internal or external stimuli&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; Architecture: a: formation or construction resulting from or as if from a conscious act &lt;the architecture of the garden&gt; b: a unifying or coherent form or structure &lt;the novel lacks architecture&gt;&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3; There are many variables involved in the ability to acquire and store information, within the human memory. The senses, being one of these variables, enhance an individual's ability to retain information. Sensory influences should be addressed in architecture dedicated to memory; such as architectural memorials. Memories formed within or associated to a memorial have the potential to be carried with an individual for the rest of their life. Senses connect people to their surroundings in natural and built environments by affording them a greater perception of space. This perception helps them further understand their existence in space, in relation to objects around them. Memory and sensory are closely linked, and should be experienced together. Creating an architectural memorial which not only acknowledges who or what is being remembered, but also engages the human senses, has the ability to link experience, sense and memory to a built form of remembering. This bond of sense and memory forms an individual embodied experience, which holds the potential to coincide with experiences of individuals who experienced the memorial in the past, or of individuals who experience the memorial in the future. A memorial can become a link between generations of the past and future. It can become the present.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/dale/DaleJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The invasion potential and competitive ability of Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (camelina) in rangeland ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Davis, Philip Browning</field><field name="description">Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (large-seeded false-flax) is a recently introduced oilseed crop in Montana and has potential for large scale production for the biofuel market. However, due to weedy characteristics, the invasive potential of this species is of concern. A need exists to create a pre-entry protocol to accurately assess risk to minimize uncertainty inherent in qualitative weed risk assessment approaches. We assessed the probability of C. sativa to invade rangeland ecosystems of southwest Montana to address this concern. The objectives of this study were to 1) quantitatively assess the invasion potential of C. sativa by collecting demographic data over two years and developing a population dynamics model, 2) compare experimental results and modeling outcomes to predictions suggested by a qualitative weed risk assessment system, and 3) assess the impact of growing conditions on the relative competitiveness of C. sativa and Brassica napus (L.) (canola). Objective 1 was carried out in two contrasting rangeland ecosystems to assess the effects of disturbance and seeding season on emergence, survival, and fecundity rates of C. sativa. Population growth (lambda) was forecasted by developing a population dynamics model. Resulting lambda values from simulations using observed data never exceeded 0.03 and the maximum time to extinction was six years. The low lambda values indicate that the threat of invasion by this species in the studied ecosystems is low. Objective 2 compared quantitative results to predictions from the Australian weed risk assessment (WRA) model. In contrast to experimental results, outcomes from the WRA suggested that this species should not be allowed entry into the region. These opposing results highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach to weed risk assessment. Objective 3 was conducted over three trials in two greenhouses. A replacement series design was used to estimate the effects of soil conditions and the presence of an invasive weed, Bromus tectorum (L.) (cheatgrass, downy brome), on the competitive outcomes between C. sativa and canola. Replacement series diagrams determined that competition occurred and that canola was the superior competitor in all treatments, thus providing further evidence that the invasion potential of C. sativa is low.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/davis/DavisP0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He has given example for our flight: Antony's cartographic exit from 'Antony and Cleopatra'</field><field name="creator">Davison, Katherine Anne</field><field name="description">This project begins with the observation that mapping culture in Early Modern England underwent explosive changes that profoundly effected the spatial perspectives of individuals.

Approaches designed to illuminate how we view films, and make films, often limit our thinking, instead. It is not surprising that the analysis of such an extraordinary medium presents endless arguments, debate and inspires the critic or theorist to narrow the field of view in order to make it manageable. Recent work in the fields of cognitive psychology and neuroscience which, when applied to our critical analyses of film, is changing the discipline of film studies. In conjunction with traditional narratology, this interdisciplinary approach enables us to reconfigure the relationship between narrative and spectacle, creating a triangular relationship that draws attention to discourse. This triangular approach affords a more nuanced and comprehensive analysis of how science documentaries affect viewers. In turn, these analyses encourage science filmmakers to recognize discourse as a means of creating more emotionally powerful, aesthetically coherent, and memorable science films. Like a great mind, the discipline of film studies flourishes most when it remains open. The creation of this triangular analytical relationship is merely one way of enhancing our ability to study the effects films have on an audience, on the future of the medium, and on aesthetics as a whole. In seeking an academic and theoretical basis for the gut level notion that films affect us both emotionally and intellectually, it is critical to chart an interdisciplinary course.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/devereux/DevereuxA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The process of place for architecture</field><field name="creator">Diggins, Nicholaus Michael</field><field name="description">Too often architecture is perceived as only a building and its site. To utilize the power of architecture one must harness and develop the true nature of place in its totality. Development must be rooted in the human need to connect to their world and surroundings, allowing one to fully understand their own identity. Every site has its own unique spirit, or genius loci. Finding this is a process and, when tapped into correctly, the genius loci can create a connection between the human body and the spirit of their surroundings. Ultimately the human existence thrives on the need to belong. The separation of place and architecture leads to confusion and the division of body and spirit. Architecture needs to be the medium that enhances a place's identity and can connect one to the world around them. Place must be developed through an understanding of how it came to be, what it is now and how it will be shaped and strengthened as a union between architecture and place. Knowing how to deconstruct the social and built environments to origins for our understanding is the basis of questioning. A full body experience has the power to enrich our life by connecting spirit and identity into an environment. Architecture is art and science of design; it develops identities related to site, further strengthening them. It is a product of man alone, who has an inner ability to leave his mark respectively within a landscape by using human design, creating harmony between body and nature through the art of architecture. The solution is to create an Architecture that allows one to be awakened to the world around them, through a process of raising awareness to an environment and its specifics.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/diggins/DigginsN0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of simulation attributes on driver perception and behavior</field><field name="creator">Durkee, Shaun Michael</field><field name="description">Transportation systems in today's world are complex, diverse, and dangerous. Drivers execute many tasks in order to safely and efficiently maneuver their vehicles in these systems. Evaluation of vehicle speed (ego motion) and inter-vehicle distance (egocentric distance) are crucial skills and constant demands while operating a motor vehicle. Common maneuvers such as braking, obstacle avoidance, and overtaking rely heavily on such skills. Driving skills and transportation safety concerns in general have been studied over the years by many research methodologies. One such methodology, the driving simulator, has emerged as a leading research tool to help understand driver behavior and mitigate traffic safety concerns. The overall effectiveness of driving simulation as a research tool is linked to how accurately modern technology can model reality. Therefore determining how valid simulators are in representing reality is a chief concern among researchers, as validity ensures accuracy and credibility of research efforts. Simulation validity is established both physically and behaviorally. The objective of this project was to conduct a driving simulator experiment to examine the perceptual and behavioral effects of various parameters of the simulation deemed relevant from theories of ego motion. Twenty drivers completed speed and following distance perception tasks (absolute production, fixed-increase production, and ratio production) while driving through rural road scenarios that varied in the presentation of motion, field of view, and optic flow. Tasks and dependent variables assessed driver perception of speeds (25-65 MPH) and following distances (150-300 ft) common in everyday driving. The study concluded that field of view (FOV) and optic flow simulation parameters were significant to the perception of absolute speed, with high levels of each parameter (large FOV, high optic flow) resulting in more accurate perception than low levels (small FOV, low optic flow). Also, participants perceived a high level of field of view as significantly more natural than a low level of field of view. The results of this study will add to the existing simulator body of knowledge and will also allow the researchers to quantify the relative importance of simulation parameters as a basis for future behavioral validation of the driving simulator.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/durkee/DurkeeS0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost or aware?: an examination of reading types</field><field name="creator">Forslund, Elizabeth Nicole</field><field name="description">Reader response theorists focus on studying how and why readers read, and the effects of these practices on literacy. One aspect of reader response theory that has been largely ignored, however, is the fundamental conflict that exists between two different "types" of reading: reading for pleasure, or ludic reading, which I called "immersion reading," and reading with a critical detachment from the text, or "awareness reading." Theorists such as Louise Rosenblatt and Wolfgang Iser tend to favor one "type" of reading or the other, not acknowledging the fact that both "types" exist and exert a pull on the reader. The conflict that results between the two "types" of reading, I argue, are enforced by educational practices aimed at funneling students towards one type of reading, depending on age and educational level. This educational trend is problematic for two reasons. First, because it limits the perceived appropriateness and thus the scope of literacy education in schools, and second because it actively discourages readers-especially reluctant readers-from seeing literacy as complex, multifaceted and engaging. I argue instead in support of a metacognitive approach to literacy, one that recognizes the conflicts readers encounter and addresses the potential difficulties and successes facing student readers.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/forslund/ForslundE0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colloidal suspension hydrodynamics and transport processes in microcapillary and porous media flows studied using dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="creator">Fridjonsson, Einar Orn</field><field name="description">The research presented in this dissertation uses Magnetic Resonance Microscopy (MRM) to investigate complex fluid dynamics systems. The systems investigated are colloidal transport in a microcapillary, bifurcation and porous medium, reactive transport in porous medium, transport through beta-lactoglobulin gels and the effect of peptide surfactants on droplet deformation in a Taylor-Couette device. Complex transport phenomena underlies many applications in engineering and thorough understanding of convective and diffusive motion in multiphase systems is important. MRM allows for the investigation of multi-phase transport phenomena noninvasively and can be used to investigate different moments of motion by sequence of the application of magnetic field gradients. The measurement of coherent and incoherent motion separately and the simultaneous measurement of multiple phases (colloids or suspending fluid) is possible. The colloidal flow studies show the effects shear induced migration, deposition, incoherent and coherent motion have on the macro- and microscopic structure of the fluids. Results show the direct effect increased shear has on the onset of secondary and chaotic fluid motion due to microscopic particle-particle and macroscopic fluid-structure interactions indicating the presence of shear thresholds. Reactive transport in porous media is important for understanding the spread of contaminants in the Earth's subsurface. The effect of calcium carbonate precipitation in a model porous medium due to Sporosarcina pasturii growth on the hydrodynamics was measured using MRM. These measurements show an increase in mechanical mixing causing a more rapid asymptote to Gaussian dynamics than for the same system without precipitation. The transport measurements of water with and without NaCl flowing through a homogeneous (pH 7.0) and heterogeneous (pH 5.2) beta-lactoglobulin gels quantifies the hydrodynamic dispersion in the gels and provided direct information on the gel structure noninvasively. Droplet deformation of (36/64)%wt toluene/chloroform droplets in a continuous phase of glycerol inside a Taylor-Couette device with and without surfactants (2%wt Tween60, AM1 and AFD4 peptide surfactants) is measured using a rapid MRM sequence (ROTACOR) which compensates for system rotation. MRM measurements show a restriction to droplet deformation due to the presence of the peptide surfactants.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/fridjonsson/FridjonssonE0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between tourist and traveler: exploring the threshold between fast and slow</field><field name="creator">Gamble, Alexander William</field><field name="description">Speed in relation to traveling leads to the loss of a direct engagement with the physical environment. Tourists travel as quickly as possible to see as much as they can, and after arriving at a station or airport they will leave the terminal in the travel mindset and still be focused on efficiency and speed, preventing them from connecting with the character of their destination on a deeper level. It is my goal to create a transition space for travelers that mediates between the intimate character of place and the ubiquitous nature of high speed travel. By designing for a traveler's inertia I believe that architecture has the potential to better transition people between speed space and the experiential realm. Slowing down the tourist can allow for more meaningful experiences of place and let the traveler engage more deeply with one's physical environment.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/gamble/GambleA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves: why have they grown so fast?</field><field name="creator">Gantt, Ryan Preston</field><field name="description">The first decade of the twenty-first century witnessed an historically unprecedented rise in the quantity of assets held as foreign exchange reserves by central banks. The locus of this rise has been in east Asia. By analyzing the change in reserve accumulation behavior which followed the financial crises that swept the globe in the late 1990s, this paper puts forth an explanation of the rise in East Asian reserve holdings based on increased sensitivity to perceived crisis risk by the Asian "Tigers" (including Japan and China). Our findings indicate that not only are reserve holdings worldwide higher since the end of the 1990s in real terms, but that the increase in East Asian reserve holdings has outpaced the rest of the world by a factor of 6. Empirical results corroborate the hypothesis that the relevant channel of influence for this change is through the interaction of exchange rate policy-specifically, a "fixed" exchange rate regime-and the extent to which a country engages in international trade.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/gantt/GanttR0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiation tolerant many-core computing system for aerospace applications</field><field name="creator">Gauer, Clinton Francis</field><field name="description">When integrated circuits are exposed to ionizing radiation, a variety of fault conditions can occur. This draws concern to the aerospace community as they look toward integrating more complex computing systems into flight applications. The detrimental effects that radiation can have on integrated circuits can be broken up into two categories: single event effects and total ionizing dose. Single event effects refer to non-destructive electron hole pairs that are created by the radiation which can lead to logical failures. Total ionizing dose refers to the permanent damage to a device caused by the electron hole pairs getting trapped prior to recombination and results in oxide breakdown and leakage current. In order to provide a robust computing platform for aerospace applications, both of these effects must be addressed. This thesis presents a set of novel fault mitigation strategies to increase the reliability of aerospace flight computers by exploiting the reconfigurability of Field Programmable Gate Arrays. First, redundant circuitry and a voting system are used to recover from non-destructive faults. Secondly, spare circuitry is used to spatially avoid faults and replace permanently damaged circuitry. Finally, partial reconfiguration of the Field Programmable Gate Array is used to repair faults in the configuration memory of the device. These fault mitigation techniques are all combined into a complete system to provide a robust computing platform for aerospace applications.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/gauer/GauerC0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the geometry and topology of the angular momentum of light</field><field name="creator">Gelbord, Todd Richard</field><field name="description">The classical field theory approach to the angular momentum of light, specifically how it represents the spin angular momentum of light, has been a matter of controversy for some time.

Discourse analysis will be used as a tool to explain the existence of the variety of codes in the classroom setting: teaching code, behavioral code, student code, spoken and textual codes. This project also attempts to fill in the gap that currently exists in the scholarly discussion on teaching code-switching strategies in monolingual discursive situations. Review of literature situates the general topic in an historical context and critically analyzes the most relevant published research through summary, classification and comparison, and promotes reflexivity upon language choice in educational settings. Theoretical framework composed of the synthesis of findings in discourse analysis, ethnography of communication and critical language awareness focuses attention on classroom discourses, especially those pertaining to the analysis of written textbooks. Furthermore, the theory serves as a solid foundation for building awareness of how language functions in written texts, and it has the potential to make teachers and students more aware of the effects of code-switching techniques in a text. The third chapter applies this theoretical framework to the textbook 'Crafting Authentic Voices' by Tom Romano. This theory and its application has a potential to make contributions to the development of curriculum, pedagogy, instructional planning in the English Language Arts classrooms.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/gilmetdinova/GilmetdinovaA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemistry and mineralogy of Tongue River member coal from three Montana coal mines</field><field name="creator">Gottschalk, Caroline McColl</field><field name="description">The geochemistry and mineralogy of coal from the Absaloka, Rosebud, and Decker mines located in the Powder River Basin in Montana have been characterized to determine the bulk composition of inorganic constituents in the coal; mineralogy of the coal, including the identity, morphology, composition and distribution of minerals present; occurrence and distribution of potentially hazardous trace elements; and chemical state of selected elements (N, O, S). These data were acquired using instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and time of flight mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In aggregate, these analytical techniques provide complementary information and also allow for cross-technique comparison of results. Overall the Montana coals contain mineral assemblages that are typical of coals described from across the United States and the world. Comparing Montana Powder River basin coal versus the rest of the United States coals, Montana Power River has, overall, a remarkably lower abundance of potentially hazardous elements. XRD analysis revealed kaolinite in all samples, variably present are quartz, illite, calcite, dolomite, gypsum, and pyrite. SEM/EDS imaging and analysis confirmed the occurrence of these mineral phases and the dominance of kaolinite in ash layers. Pyrite is the primary sulfide mineral that occurs in a variety of crystal forms that could affect its solubility, and therefore, potential for acid release. Pyrite occurs as a pure compound with no As nor other potentially hazardous element as part of a solid solution. However XPS analysis of sulfide rich areas reveal a concentration of Se and Co suggesting these elements are sorbed onto the pyrite surfaces. This study provided a reconnaissance overview of the geochemistry and mineralogy of these Montana coal mines. Future work could include a more detailed chemical stratigraphy of the coal-producing layers to better characterize the distribution of minerals and elemental components in the coal, and to determine the processes responsible for their occurrence and distribution. The results of this study are applicable to the future development of clean coal technologies and to address the potential environmental and health impacts of coal combustion.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/gottschalk/GottschalkC0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of physically aware routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) algorithms for next generation transparent optical networks</field><field name="creator">Hahn, Timothy Allen</field><field name="description">Optical networks form the foundation of today's information infrastructure. Current generation optical networks consist largely of point-to-point electronically transmitted links which switch between nodes and repeaters. There is a trend in optical networking to move from the current generation opaque networks toward transparent networks. Transparent networks use only optical devices, eliminating the costly need for OEO conversions. Unfortunately, transparent networks present a unique challenge in maintaining acceptable signal quality levels. This research is an investigation of RWA algorithms in transparent optical networks. We present RAPTOR, a custom built discrete event program to simulate optical networks. RAPTOR uses its physically aware modules to accurately calculate three of the dominant physical impairments. RAPTOR is fast and multi-threaded. We introduce several new performance metrics. RAPTOR enables us to study transparent optical networks in a unique and realistic manner. We conduct an extensive performance analysis of existing RWA algorithms. We explore many different traffic models, traffic loads, signal quality, and network topologies in a comprehensive fashion. We directly compare the leading RWA algorithms in a manner has not been done before. We studied new RWA algorithms in two fields: Dynamic Programming and Ant Colony Optimization. Our new Dynamic Programming based algorithm has the best overall performance in most scenarios. It is flexible and adapts well to all network conditions we studied. It shows good promise for future optical networks.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/hahn/HahnT0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who do I help?: an experimental examination of dominant ideology threat, group membership, and prosocial behavior</field><field name="creator">Hawkinson, Kristin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The American dream ideology (ADI) consists of working hard, taking responsibility for oneself, and being rewarded for those efforts. Therefore, the ADI precludes asking for help. The current project investigated the possibility that if a victim violates the ADI (in this case by asking for help), this violation may result in others withholding resources. Additionally, the current project investigated whether characteristics of the victim (e.g., a victim's ingroup (American) or outgroup (international) membership) and characteristics of the helper (as someone who had violated the ADI or not) influenced amount of help offered to a victim. In Study 1, participants (n = 60) were reminded of the ADI, then read about and rated a fellow ingroup or outgroup victim who was violating the ADI by asking for help (or not). Participants then reported willingness to help that victim. Results showed that men participants were relatively unwilling to help the victim regardless of condition, whereas women were only willing to help a victim who did not violate the ADI. Unexpectedly, the victim's group membership had no effect on amount of help offered. By including a control prime, Study 2 (n = 61) extended these findings by testing whether a reminder of the ADI was necessary to inflict the withholding of positive resources to a victim who violated the ADI. Additionally, to explore a way to increase helping to a victim asking for help, participants were made to perceive themselves as violating the ADI (or not). Results showed that again women were more likely to help the victim than were men, but only when women were not reminded of the ADI. Results further showed that women were more likely to derogate the victim when they were both primed with the ADI and perceived themselves as violating the ADI. Taken together, results suggest that although women may be willing to help an ingroup and outgroup member equally, they will still enact subtle prejudice (e.g., the withholding of positive resources) against victims who ask for help if the American dream ideology is salient. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/hawkinson/HawkinsonK0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Macrofiber piezoelectric composite for lunar exploration actuator</field><field name="creator">Henslee, Isaac Andrew</field><field name="description">Understanding the nature and location of water and other resources on Earth's Moon is an essential component to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) space exploration efforts. To aid in these exploration efforts, an investigation into lightweight and reliable materials for a lunar valve actuator design has lead to characterizing the lifetime performance of the piezoelectric fiber composite, macro fiber composite (MFC). MFC's are thin rectangular patches made of polyimide film, epoxy and a single layer of rectangular lead zirconium titanate fibers and are commercially available. As a basis for this consideration, the useful life of the MFC is being characterized to determine the effect of temperature on the performance of the material as it is fatigued by cyclical piezoelectric excitation or actuation. The test specimen consist of the MFC laminated to a cantilevered stainless steel beam using epoxy and is actuated at the first resonant frequency of the beam laminate by the cyclic application of 1000 volts. Strain and beam tip displacement measurements are used as a basis for determining the performance of the MFC as it is cyclically actuated under various operating temperatures. The temperature of the beam laminate is held constant during cyclic actuation and cycled to failure or 250 million cycles, to determine the useful life of the MFC over a temperature range from -15&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C to 145&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C. The results of the experimentation efforts show a strong temperature dependence on operational life for the MFC. No significant degradation in operational performance was identified thru monitoring of the MFC, as the MFC was cyclically actuated up to the point of failure, regardless of temperature or actuation cycle. The results of the experimental testing can be used to better inform designs, such as actuators, using MFC in environments where operational temperatures differ from standard laboratory temperatures, as well as, to better design temperature controlled environments where MFC's are used as actuators.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/henslee/HensleeI0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regeneration architecture</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Daniel Alexander</field><field name="description">In a world of excess, people rarely stop to realize their impact on their environments. Our built environment is especially feeling the effect of our irresponsibility, and the solution is only a matter of re-wiring our perceptions of energy usage. Many technologies make it possible to have the impossible, but nobody stops to question whether or not these advances are beneficial. A presumably sustainable system turned out to be one of the most energy wasteful ones in existence. In the complex process of getting food from the field to your house, the best solution is to simplify. Nature will do most of the work; we need to learn to work with it. Current building practices can benefit greatly from this concept, to rethink the existing process by simply cutting out the unneeded steps and using the free energy available to us every day. Our values need to change. Because the corporation controls so much of our daily lives, they are the ones that will bring about the change in consciousness we desperately need. By re-designing Sysco headquarters to do everything that the company claims to do (and currently doesn't), and interact with the public in a new and radical way, not only can we make changes to how we think about the built environment, but we can also start to show that a change in awareness is entirely possible. If we can change the values of those that make the biggest differences in our world, then we've effectively changed an entire populations' way of thinking.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/hudson/HudsonD0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential response biases between older and younger adults on recall tests</field><field name="creator">Huff, Mark Jordan</field><field name="description">This study examined the role of differential response biases between older and younger adults on recall performance and confidence judgments.

The results showed that both older and younger adults adjusted their responses in accordance with test instructions. Older adults reported a greater number of intrusions relative to younger adults in both standard and penalty instructions, particularly those intrusions that were plausible given a prior study list. Additionally, older adults were more likely to report intrusions with greater confidence that they were presented on an earlier studied list.

Accurate mapping and monitoring of this species are needed to understand leafy spurge's extent and spread. Current methods are based on ground crews who survey patches. Development of an affordable technique to map and monitor leafy spurge would contribute to the control of this species. High spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution imagery was used to classify the amount of leafy spurge present with ground and aerial-based imagery. A proof of concept study was performed in 2008 using ground-based images of an area infested with leafy spurge. This proof of concept project guided the development of the methods to be used for the 2009 aerial portion of the study. Thirty-five randomly selected reference points were selected in a range area in southwest Montana. These reference points were ground surveyed to record the density of leafy spurge in a 0.5-m radius area around the reference point. Images were captured approximately 108-m from the study area and classified using random forest classification. Multiple images were collected throughout the summer in order to determine at which time period leafy spurge is most easily detected. A classification using multiple image dates was also performed to determine if a time series of images improves classification. Single date accuracies were highest late in the summer with the highest single date classification achieving 83% accuracy. The multiple date classification significantly increased overall accuracy. Several aerial images were acquired in southwest Montana over the 2009 summer. Fifty randomly selected 2-m x 2-m reference areas were surveyed for percent cover of leafy spurge as well as several other variables. Aerial images were collected at flight elevations between 300-m to 460-m. Classifications were performed using random forest classifier, and both single date and multiple date classifications were performed. Leafy spurge was most accurately detected early and late in the growing season, and significant classification accuracy increases were observed with the multiple date classification. Single date accuracies achieved 90% accuracy in early June, while multiple date classifications achieved over 96% accuracy.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/jay/JayS0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogical methodology &amp; architectural facilitation</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Brian Edward</field><field name="description">Pedagogical methodology has rarely been considered as a driving force in educational facilities planning and design. Because of constantly changing learning modalities, state standardization of learning and incredibly diverse educational demographic, designing learning spaces that support various pedagogies is paramount if our students are to succeed in the knowledge-based economy. From its beginnings as the rural one-room school house to the contemporary single volume, teaching and learning methodologies are continually changing and adapting to contemporary necessity. Little emphasis has been placed over the qualitative aspects of facilities planning, and how children may benefit from varying spatial environments. No practical and consistent concept of open-space learning has ever been established when considering open-concept education. This is the fundamental tenet to this master's thesis. This thesis will analyze contemporary learning methodologies with particular emphasis on physical learning and the transition to digital learning. Through the analysis of varying pedagogies specific qualitative themes, modalities, and hierarchical mechanisms will be made known and the architectural design strategies will draw upon these themes. The thesis presents information necessary to designing within a neighborhood sensitive to history and place. The rich significance of place in the Mississippi/Yazoo Delta will be a driving force in the design of a K-6 Elementary school to replace the existing school. The thesis will additionally draw upon the analysis of various precedents, demographic studies, site analyses, and code analyses to establish an architecture rich in character and performative qualities necessary for growing minds.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/johnson/JohnsonB0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nursing students' perceptions of working with staff nurses</field><field name="creator">Jones, Sharon Holly</field><field name="description">The purpose of this project was to examine the perceptions of nursing students working with staff nurses during their clinical experiences.

Nursing schools and faculty are charged with theoretical and clinical education of nursing students so they may enter into the nursing profession as competent and safe nurses. Staff nurses play integral roles in the formative development of students. Data from a previous study were examined. The variables of friendliness, approachability, availability and willingness of staff nurses were evaluated. Students consistently ranked the ability of nurses to teach lowest and friendliness of nurses highest. Student comments were organized qualitatively utilizing retrospective analysis. Two themes were identified from the qualitative data which added to the veracity of the research. Positive reported nurse behaviors towards students were then utilized as a basis for a mentoring guide. Limitations for this project, as well as implications and topics of future research were identified and discussed.

This sample was studied in detail using two microwave frequencies, 9.4 GHz and 34.4 GHz. It was also studied both at room temperature and at 10 K.

The other two samples were LiNbO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;:Mg:Fe, one of congruent composition and the other of stoichiometric composition. The congruent composition contained 6% mol Mg and 0.02% mol Fe, while the stoichiometric sample contained 0.45% mol Mg and 0.01% mol Fe. The stoichiometric composition contains all the same centers observed in the congruent material, plus two additional centers. Since the stoichiometric material provides EPR spectra of much higher resolution, those centers existing in both compositions were characterized more accurately from the stoichiometric material. A discussion of models for dopant center symmetries, dopant positions in the LiNbO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; lattice, and the charge compensators required by each center is provided.

Lamb thermogenesis and immunocompetence are key elements in neonatal lamb survival. Research has shown an increase in lamb vigor, when ewes were supplemented during late gestation with algae-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). However, the impact of DHA on lamb thermogenesis and immunocompetence has not been investigated. Eighty twin-bearing Targhee ewes were assigned randomly to 1 of 2 supplemental treatments to determine the effects of feeding (DHA) to ewes during late gestation and early lactation on lamb thermogenesis, immunocompetence, serum metabolites and hormones, and lamb growth. Treatments within supplements were: 1) 12 g/ewe daily of the product DHA Gold in the form of algal biomass (ALGAE), and 2) no DHA (CONTROL). Treatment supplements were individually fed daily during the last 30 d of gestation and pen fed (6 pens/treatment, and 6 or 7 ewes/pen) during the first 38 d of lactation. One h after lambing and before nursing, twin-born lambs were weighed, bled via jugular puncture, and placed in a dry cold chamber for 30 min (0&amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C). Lamb rectal temperatures were recorded every 1 min. After 30 min, lambs were removed from the cold chamber, bled, warmed for 15 min, and returned to their dam. Ewes were bled and colostrum samples collected 1 h postpartum. Ewe and lamb sera were assayed for glucose, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), cortisol, leptin and anti-Parainfluenza Type 3 (PI&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3;) titers. Lamb rectal temperature, glucose, NEFA, cortisol, leptin, anti-PI&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3; titers, and birth weights did not differ between treatments. Thirty-eight-d BW was greater (P = 0.03) in lambs born to CONTROL-supplemented than lambs born to ALGAE-supplemented ewes; however, the colostrum of ALGAE-supplemented ewes had a greater specific gravity (P = 0.05), indicating greater IgG concentrations, than colostrum of CONTROL-supplemented ewes. Supplementation of DHA during late gestation and early lactation had a negative impact on lamb BW and did not affect indices of lamb thermogenesis, but may have improved IgG concentrations in ewe colostrum.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/keithly/KeithlyJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invision: our world redefined</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Jason Edward</field><field name="description">The interstate 70 corridor serves as a gateway to the mountainous region of Colorado for all of Denver's residents, the majority of travelers from the East, and most all visitors flying into the state.

The parameter estimation ability of these detectors can be determined by simulating the response to predicted gravitational wave sources with instrument noise and searching for the signals with sophisticated data analysis methods. A possible source of gravitational waves will be beams of radiation from discontinuities on cosmic length strings. Cosmic strings are predicted to form kinks and cusps that travel along the string at close to the speed of light. These disturbances are radiated away as highly beamed gravitational waves that produce a burst-like pulse as the cone of emission sweeps past an observer. The detection of a gravitational wave signal from a cosmic string cusp would illuminate the fields of string theory, cosmology, and relativity. Gravitational wave sources also include coalescing binary systems of compact objects. Colliding galaxies have central black holes that sink to the center of the merged galaxy and begin to orbit one another and emit gravitational waves. Previous LISA data analysis studies have assumed that binary black hole systems have a circular orbit or an extreme mass ratio. It is ultimately necessary to understand the general case of spinning black hole binary systems in eccentric orbits and how LISA observations can be used to measure the eccentricity of the orbits as well as the masses, spins, and luminosity distances of the black holes. Once LISA is operational, the comparison of observations of eccentric and circular black hole binary sources will constrain theories on galaxy mergers in the early universe.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/key/KeyJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High resolution direction of arrival estimation analysis and implementation in a smart antenna system</field><field name="creator">Khallaayoun, Ahmed</field><field name="description">The goal of this research is to equip the smart antenna system designed by the telecommunication group at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Montana State University with high resolution direction of arrival estimation (DOA) capabilities; the DOA block should provide accurate estimates of emitters' DOAs while being computationally efficient. Intensive study on DOA estimation algorithms was carried out to pinpoint the most suitable algorithm for the application of interest, and the spectral methods were chosen for this study. The outcome of the study consisted of generating a novel algorithm, spatial selective MUSIC, which is comparable in accuracy to other high resolution algorithms but does not require the intensive computational burden that is typical of high resolution spectral methods. Spatial selective MUSIC is compared in terms of bias, resolution, robustness and computational efficiency against the most widely used DOA estimation algorithms, namely, Bartlett, Capon, MUSIC, and beamspace MUSIC. The design, troubleshooting, and implementation of the hardware needed to implement the DOA estimation in a real case scenario was achieved. Two design phases were necessary to implement the center piece of the hardware needed to achieve DOA estimation. The 5.8 GHz 8 channel receiver board along with a casing that egg crates the RF channels for channel-to-channel isolation was designed and built. A National Instrument data acquisition card was used to simultaneously sample all the 8 channels at 2.5 MSPS, the data was processed using the PC interface built in LabView. Phase calibration that accounts for the overall system magnitude and phase differences along with a novel calibration method to mitigate the effects of magnitude and phase variations along with mutual coupling was produced during this research and was imperative to achieving high resolution DOA estimation in the lab. The DOA estimation capabilities of the built system was tested within the overall smart antenna system and showed promising results. The overall performance enhancement that the DOA estimation block can provide cannot however be fully realized until the beamforming block is revised to provide accurate and deep null placing along with a narrower beam width. This cannot be achieved with the current system due to limitations in the number of the array elements used and the granularity in the phase shifters and attenuators used in the analog beamformer.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/khallaayoun/KhallaayounA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain juniper on Wyoming and mountain big sagebrush cover in Southwest Montana</field><field name="creator">Kitchen, Karen Ann</field><field name="description">Expansion of conifers into sagebrush steppe is a management concern, since conifers reduce sagebrush cover for wildlife. The primary objective of this research was to examine the relationship between the conifers, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Rocky Mountain juniper (Juniperus scopulorum), and two subspecies of big sagebrush, Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. wyomingensis) and mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. vaseyana), in southwest Montana using a best-fit model. A secondary objective was to determine whether either of the two conifer species have a greater influence on sagebrush cover. Percent cover of both conifers and sagebrush was recorded at 40 Wyoming and 40 mountain big sagebrush plots at each of three study sites in southwest Montana (n = 240). The best-fit model utilizes the terms site, sagebrush subspecies, the square root of conifer cover, and site by sagebrush subspecies as the independent variables, with the square root of sagebrush cover as the dependent variable. The model (the square root of sagebrush cover = a i - 0.401 x square root of conifer cover; r &amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; = 0.61) found a negative relationship between conifer cover and sagebrush cover and indicates that there is no difference between the two sagebrush subspecies and across all three sites in the study area. The best-fit model was validated within the 95 % confidence interval at all three study sites. Validation trials with data from three sites outside the study area were successful for one site, suggesting that the model is better suited to lower elevation, less productive sites. There was no difference in the influence of Douglas-fir or Rocky Mountain juniper cover on live sagebrush cover, indicating that sagebrush responds similarly to competition from both species. Controlling both conifers may increase sagebrush cover slightly, but responses will be small due to low levels of initial sagebrush cover. If maintenance of sagebrush cover is desired, conifer control should be initiated before conifer cover reaches 10 %, since the rate of sagebrush decline is highest at low levels of conifer cover. However, conifer control is not recommended because both conifers and sagebrush are important components of big game winter range.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/kitchen/KitchenK0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure of low-coverage Ti and V on the Al(001) crystal surface</field><field name="creator">Kopczyk, Michael</field><field name="description">The BFS (Bozzolo-Ferrante-Smith) Method for Alloys predicts that V and Ti would be effective interlayers to act as a diffusion barrier between a metal substrate and metal overlayer. Previous work from our group using the RBS channeling technique, determined that Ti is an effective interlayer between Fe and the Al(001) bulk substrate. The Fe-V-Al(001) system was not treated in this earlier work. This thesis is focused on studying the structure of the first bi-metal interface of these tri-metal systems, i.e. the Ti-Al(001) and V-Al(001) interfaces. LEIS (low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy) and LEED (low-energy electron diffraction) were used as experimental techniques specifically designed to study the surface structure of the top few layers of sample surfaces. LEED images for the Ti-Al case gave a c(2 x 2) pattern, a change from the standard p(1x1) pattern of the clean Al(001) surface, suggesting Ti occupies every other Al lattice site. LEIS results suggest that Ti prefers subsurface occupancy for sub-monolayer Ti coverage, and fills the surface layer as deposition thickness increases above but near 1 ML. LEED images for the V-Al system produced nothing out of the ordinary, but rather display a blurry p(1x1) image, becoming less distinct as V deposition thickness increases, suggesting that V atoms place themselves in the Al substrate with no specific order. LEIS results suggest that V prefers sub-surface occupancy for both sub-monolayer and higher (up to 2.5 ML) V coverage. Contrasting the results of these experiments, we determined that the structural characteristics of the V-Al interface differed enough from those of the Ti-Al interface, to conclude that V cannot be considered as effective of an interlayer as Ti.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/kopczyk/KopczykM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geomicrobiology of iron oxyhydroxide mats in acidic geothermal springs of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States of America</field><field name="creator">Kozubal, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis had three objectives: i) Determining distribution of FCR and common root rot (CRR) of wheat in Montana; ii) Determining population dynamics between F. pseudograminearum and Bipolaris sorokiniana at different wheat development stages, and iii) Development of an integrated disease management program for Fusarium crown rot (FCR) using biological and fungicide seed treatments, cultivar resistance, and induced systemic resistance (SAR). Surveys of 91 fields over two years using qPCR identified FCR in 57% and CRR in 93% of the fields surveyed. Bipolaris sorokiniana, F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum were isolated from 15, 13 and 8% of tillers respectively. FCR distribution was highly clustered while CRR was uniformly distributed with soil type, elevation and growing degree days influencing distribution. Data from intensively sampled fields estimated yield losses caused by FCR and CRR at 3.2 to 34.9% with losses influenced by pathogen population. This study is the first time qPCR was used to survey the distribution of FCR and CRR and to study the interaction of the respective pathogens. The effect of F. pseudograminearum and B. sorokiniana inoculum applied singly or in combination at three rates showed high and low rates of F. pseudograminearum inoculum reduced Bipolaris populations, while B. sorokiniana inoculations did not affect Fusarium populations in stems. Populations of both pathogens increased from heading until harvest with Fusarium colonizing stems earlier than Bipolaris. Mixed inoculations increased incidence of infection and co-infection relative to that observed in production fields. Both fungi alone or combined reduced the seedling counts. Grain yield was inversely correlated with Fusarium populations. Difenoconazole-mefenoxam seed treatment reduced FCR severity between 29.3-50% and fungal and bacterial seed treatments were ineffective. The cv. Volt was identified as partially resistant and had the highest levels of chitinase and beta-1, 3-glucanase activity of cultivars evaluated. Induction of SAR by Bacillus mycoides isolate BmJ or acibenzolar Smethyl significantly reduced the severity of FCR compared to water controls. Integration of cultivar resistance plus fungicide seed treatment or SAR induction provided equal control in greenhouse and irrigated trials. In a dryland field trial, integration of all management tools reduced FCR more than individual tools.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/kozubal/KozubalM0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The superintendent's organizational approach to defined autonomy and the goal implementation process as it impacts student success</field><field name="creator">Kultgen, Merrl Kent</field><field name="description">This single-case study addresses the lack of qualitative research describing the instructional role of the superintendent. Guiding this study are two research questions, "How does the goal implementation process as an element of the superintendent's organizational approach impact student success?" and "How does defined autonomy as an element of the superintendent's organizational approach impact student success?" In 2002 the No Child Left Behind Act instilled a sense of urgency for the education community to implement an accountability reform placing an emphasis on schools to demonstrate effective instructional leadership at the district level. The sense of urgency caused by this political mandate, created a demand for data pertaining to the superintendent's instructional role and in 2006 Waters and Marzano completed their exhaustive quantitative meta-analysis on this subject. Their study discovered statistical data suggesting six responsibilities comprised of 51 observable practices of a superintendent that positively correlate with student success. Despite this effort, the lack of research concerning the qualitative data describing the superintendent's instructional role was still evident. The purpose of this qualitative single-case study was to collect data in a real-life, holistic environment to ascertain if the superintendent's organizational approaches did impact student success. To guide the data collection process, the six superintendent responsibilities were divided into two categories: defined autonomy and the goal implementation process. Waters and Marzano (2006) further broke these two categories into 51 observable practices (propositional theories) that statistically correlated with student success. Through Yin's (2003) guidance this researcher conducted interviews, purposeful observation and document analysis, to pattern-match data with empirical evidence. The findings suggest the organizational approaches of the superintendent did impact student success. Furthermore, new research ground was broken by discovering a process of five observable steps, that when followed will impact student success. The steps are: (1) Develop a shared vision, (2) Implement district goals, (3) Consistently communicate expectations, (4) Allow principals to implement, (5) Hold principals accountable through monitoring.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/kultgen/KultgenM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth-adult partnerships: examining the perceptions of youth and adult 4-H Foundation board members</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Eric William</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of youth-adult partnerships within state 4-H foundation boards by assessing perceptions of youth and adult members toward one another. The intent of this study was to provide youth serving organizations with empirical data pertaining to the youth-adult partnerships within the Western 4-H Foundations included in this study. The population for the study included state 4-H foundations across the United States that included both adults and youth as voting members of the foundation director's board. The purposive study sample was state 4-H foundation boards from the Western 4-H region with youth and adults in formal decision-making roles. This research was conducted using a modified form of the Involvement and Interaction Rating Scale (IIRS). The IIRS instrument was organized based on three item groups that measured the following constructs: 1) Youth Involvement Indicators, 2) Adult Involvement Indicators, and 3) Youth-Adult Interaction Indicators. Each of the three sections incorporated semantic differential questions. Adult participants consistently had higher means through out each of the three IIRS constructs. Semantic differential questions nine, twelve, and thirteen were repeatedly statistically significant throughout multiple comparisons. Evidence revealed youth with prior youth-adult partnership experience held less positive views regarding youth-adult partnerships than did the youth with no experience in a youth-adult partnership. Youth believed adults were over-bearing and did not let the youth excel to their potential. Youth perceived adults were not actively listening to youth and were not taking youths' ideas seriously.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/larsen/LarsenE0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informal micro-business development and the influence of adat on the traditional markets in Gianyar Regency, Bali, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Leavell, Lawrence Brent</field><field name="description">This study examines the development of the informal micro-business sector and how it is influenced by adat in the traditional village markets of Gianyar Regency on the island of Bali, Indonesia. Informal micro-business is an important element of the Indonesia domestic economy. The adat, commonly defined as customary ancestral laws and cultural traditions, refers specifically to customary laws, both oral and written, and is ingrained in the everyday lives of the Balinese, especially at the local village level. These "laws" act as codes of conduct that the citizens of the community must maintain and abide by. The traditional village is the place where the adat is firmly entrenched and inextricably linked to economic activities. The traditional village market is also the place where informal micro-businesses gather and perform daily economic transactions. Using ethnography and mental map research methods, this research seeks to further the knowledge and understanding of the informal micro-business sector in and near the traditional village markets of Gianyar Regency and how their development is influenced by the adat. The district markets of Payangan, Ubud and Sukawati, along with several random village markets, are selected as the research sites to demonstrate the commonalities, differences and tendencies in the traditional markets despite the presence of various economic forces. This research finds that the adat significantly influences the informal microbusiness sector and provides an opportunity for entrepreneurs to satisfy village customary and cultural needs. Further, the research finds that the traditional village, known as the Desa Adat, is the primary source of the adat's influence in the traditional market.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/leavell/LeavellL0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite element modeling of piezoelectric bimorphs with conductive polymer electrodes</field><field name="creator">Lediaev, Laura Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of my research has been to find a good way to solve for the mechanical and electrical behavior of piezoelectric polymer bimorphs which are electroded with a low to medium conductivity material. Traditionally, metal with very high conductivity has been used as the electrode material. Any applied voltage to an electrode will be distributed nearly instantaneously and uniformly throughout the electrode. Because of this quality, the voltage was assumed to be known and uniform for any applied voltage signal, including high frequency signals. The disadvantage of metal is that it is stiffer than polymers, and thus impedes the bending of the bimorph to a greater extent than for comparable polymer electrodes. With the modern invention of conductive polymers with acceptably high conductivities, it is now possible to manufacture piezoelectric devices with finite conductivity electrodes. For all but the very lowest frequencies of applied voltage signals, the voltage distribution cannot be assumed to be uniform throughout the electrode, nor can it be assumed to be exactly in phase. With finite conductivity electrodes there will be a loss in voltage amplitude due to resistivity, and there will also be a phase lag. The piezoelectric problem involves solving a coupled set of differential equations which involve mechanical displacement and electric potential. The electrical behavior of the electrodes is also included in the formulation, so that the voltage distribution in the electrodes is solved for simultaneously with the mechanical displacement and electric potential in the piezoelectric sheets. In this dissertation the coupled set of differential equations was solved using the Finite Element Method with quadratic Lagrange finite elements. The piezoelectric polymer which was modeled was polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The conductive polymer of interest was PEDOT-PSS, although the model is valid for any type of isotropic finite conductivity material. The results of the work show that for moderate conductivity, the mechanical response of the bimorph is very good. There will not be a large phase lag within the first frequency mode. The bimorph resonates at low frequencies, and so any large effect from finite conductivity would only occur at higher modes.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/lediaev/LediaevL0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for circumstance: changing perception in the built environment</field><field name="creator">Leppert, Jordan Lee</field><field name="description">In our ever-changing world, the role of architecture and designer is constantly adapting to a new criteria.

The dissertation shows that in many cases the few-essential-levels model can be successfully applied for the description and interpretation of two-photon absorption spectra and cross sections, at least for the low-energy transitions. The dissertation presents examples of applications of two-photon absorption for volumetric optical storage and cancer tumor detection. It describes the basic principles of the two-photon absorption-based optical memory and limitations imposed on two-photon sensitivity of photochromic materials by a necessity of fast access to the data. It also proposes a novel technique for sensitive detection of cancer cells by using two-photon excitation of near-IR fluorescence of a commercial dye and discusses the mechanisms responsible for differentiation between the normal and the cancer cells. The methods described in this dissertation can be applied to understanding the relations between structure and two-photon absorption strength of individual transitions of organic and biological chromophores, which can be used for design of new materials, maximally adapted for particular applications.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/makarov/MakarovN0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Twist in coronal magnetic fields</field><field name="creator">Malanushenko, Anna Viktorovna</field><field name="description">Twist of magnetic field is believed to play important role in driving instabilities that result in eruptive events on the Sun. This thesis provides different methods to measure twist in the solar corona. First, given a model of coronal field, twist of a magnetic domain (i.e., a volume that contains all field lines connecting two regions of interest in the photosphere) is well studied for cases when the domain is a thin cylinder. For cases when such approximation is inapplicable a generalization of twist can be derived from a quantity called additive self-helicity. I develop explicit numerical methods to compute generalized twist. I also demonstrate that such a quantity sets a threshold on kink instability like the traditional twist does for thin cylinders. In a more realistic scenario, coronal magnetic field is not known and so neither is its helicity. There are two principal methods to overcome this problem. The first is to integrate helicity flux across the photosphere (as helicity is believed to be approximately conserved in the corona) using magnetic field on Sun's surface. There is little published evidence as yet that coronal helicity indeed corresponds to its integrated photospheric flux. The second is to extrapolate the coronal magnetic field using surface measurements as boundary conditions and use this extrapolation for helicity computation; for fields with complicated structure such extrapolations are extremely challenging and suffer from major drawbacks. I develop a method to estimate twist of coronal fields without attempting complicated extrapolations or studying helicity flux. The method builds a simple uniformly-twisted magnetic field and adjusts its properties until there is one line in this field that matches one coronal loop; this is repeated for all evident coronal loops resulting in twist measurements for each individual loop. I use this method to demonstrate that the rate of change of twist in the solar corona is indeed approximately equal to the one derived from photospheric helicity flux. The results of this dissertation are useful for better understanding of magnetic topology in general. They are also extremely promising for extrapolating coronal magnetic fields. Measurements of coronal twist might aid in predicting magnetic instabilities.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/malanushenko/MalanushenkoA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into why people tan despite the known health risks</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Lindsay Renae Tudor</field><field name="description">Skin cancer is a major health concern in the U.S. today.

Results were analyzed based on certain themes that developed from the question scores. Overall, dermatology patients demonstrated certain knowledge deficiencies in what they know regarding UV exposure, indoor tanning, and skin cancer. The results from this study indicated a need for skin cancer awareness campaigns to include additional information about UV exposure and tanning beds.

However, genetic selection based on historical measures of feed efficiency or feed to gain ratios (F:G) is unable to improve this trait because of correlations between feed efficiencies and gain traits. Residual feed intake (RFI) is an alternative measure of feed efficiency that is independent of body weight (BW) and growth traits. RFI is the difference between an animal's actual feed intake and expected feed intake. For example, an animal that consumes 3 pounds less feed than expected would be assigned a RFI of -3 and is considered more feed efficient than those with larger RFI measures. Seed stock producers sell bulls to cow/calf producers. Cow/calf producers select bulls that are perceived to have the greatest potential to improve the genetics of breeding cows and/or their offspring. Bull sales often provide sale catalogs to potential buyers that contain various performance measures including expected progeny differences (EPDs) and simple performance measures (SPMs). These measures provide information to purchasers so that rational decisions regarding genetic improvements can be made. Midland Bull Test (MBT) in Columbus, MT conducts bull performance tests on 1,200 bulls annually for bull producers throughout the Unites States. In 2008 and 2009, MBT used a new technology (GrowSafe) to record individual feed intake which allows for the calculation of RFI. These measures, along with performance EPDs, provide the basis for a linear hedonic price model to determine if bull purchasers value RFI. Regression results indicate buyers are willing to pay additional amounts for bulls that are RFI efficient. However, buyers appear to be valuing RFI below its theoretical contribution to cost reductions because of risk and uncertainty. Purchasers at the MBT bull sales valued gain traits, birth weight, and age more highly than RFI. If this behavior is consistent in other markets and buyers continue to value RFI, it would be reasonable to expect an RFI EPD to be developed in the future.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/mcdonald/McDonaldT0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscapes, architecture</field><field name="creator">McGrane, Kurt Ryan</field><field name="description">Continued population growth is inevitable to Montana's future. This can be seen as a source of great alarm or great opportunity. If suburbanization of Montana's agricultural and wild mountain landscapes continues, eventually that which makes Montana so appealing - its open space - will disappear. Future growth should be seen as an opportunity to densify and enrich Montana's existing urban centers. However, prevailing attitudes of what it means to live in Montana as well as economic and infrastructural constructs, currently promote a gradually expanding low density sprawl. As important as open landscapes and nature are to the identity and appeal of Montana, continued population growth means man-made structures are increasingly becoming the dominant presence on the land. Perhaps instead of pressing low density architecture outward over the landscape, the landscape can be drawn into the architecture. By providing an urban park of densely layered activity but defined by a spacial characteristic of openness, a surrounding urbanity can be made possible which still retains Montana's defining character and appeal. This project will be a proactive architectural act, an urban catalyst for change. It will utilize the concepts of Landscape Infrastructure, Terrain Vague, and The Fold to give a sense of ambiguity and slipperyness to the program and allow it to relate to both urban and ecological frameworks. This ambiguity will allow for the interpretive freedom necessary for the assertion of individual identity to occur, as well as give the project an ability to adapt to future changes in the urban (and rural) fabric. Individual programs will be defined based on local needs, and where these separate (and perhaps strikingly disparate) programs intersect, nodes of unpredictable excitement can manifest. Introducing a public, open ended, multi-layered program designed with both specificity and ambiguity will provide an answer to the western conflict between freedom of the individual and the shared environmental responsibility of land stewardship.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/mcgrane/McGraneK0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population genetics of Synehococcus species inhabiting the Mushroom Spring microbial mat, Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Melendrez, Melanie Crystal</field><field name="description">The species concept in microbiology is under considerable debate. Some scientists believe that traditional approaches are adequate, while others search for more natural concepts. The ecotype concept (ecological species concept) was evaluated in this work. Two temperature sites of a well-studied microbial mat system in Yellowstone National Park were investigated. Previous molecular analyses with 16S rRNA and the adjacent internal transcribed spacer (ITS) suggested the dominance of two putative ecotypes (PEs) of cyanobacteria in these sites, Synechococcus genotypes A and B'. Higher resolution molecular approaches were developed to address the hypotheses that (i) there are more Synechococcus PEs than those discerned by 16S rRNA/ITS sequence variation, (ii) these PEs exhibit distinct ecological distribution patterns and (iii) recombination has been less important than mutation in shaping the evolution of these Synechococcus populations. Analysis of single protein-encoding loci revealed more sample-specific PEs than previously detected, but didn't account for recombination. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries were constructed to sample multiple loci near 16S rRNA genes for multi-locus sequence analyses (MLSA). Analysis of BAC clone end sequences revealed that 16S rRNA regions of the genomes of Synechococcus A- and B'-like populations have undergone rearrangement. Multiple BAC loci were analyzed using two population genetics algorithms; Evolutionary Simulation (ES) and eBURST. ES of concatenated MLSA sequences, but not eBURST analysis, suggested a much greater number of PEs than were detected by 16S rRNA and ITS and provided stronger evidence of sample-specificity. Recombination, suggested by phylogenetic incongruency among loci, multiple recombination tests and polymorphism patterns, appears to have been more frequent than mutation, but not to have erased ecotype structure. Many PEs predicted by ES contained a dominant variant surrounded by rare variants. eBURST predicted some clonal complexes with the same dominant variant, but different rare variants. ES appears to miss phylogenetically distant variants that differ at one locus, whereas eBURST appears to miss phylogenetically similar variants that differ at &gt;1 locus. True ecotype populations in nature may contain both types of variants, but this must be evaluated by examining the distribution of all variants relative to environmental gradients.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/melendrez/MelendrezM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algal biofilms, microbial fuel cells, and implementation of state-of-the-art research into chemical and biological engineering laboratories</field><field name="creator">Menicucci, Joseph Anthony Jr.</field><field name="description">Alternative energy technologies become more attractive as the price of energy from fossil fuels becomes more expensive and the environmental concerns from their use mount. While a number of biological alternative energy technologies currently exist, a complete understanding of these technologies has yet to be developed. This dissertation characterizes an aspect of biological alternative energy technologies: the production of algal biofuels and energy conversion in microbial fuel cells. Specifically, this dissertation addresses the characterization of microalgae as a biofilm and the characterization of the power limitations of microbial fuel cells. The attachment and detachment of algae were observed using temporal microscopic imaging in a flow-cell with autofluorescence and staining techniques as part of a collaborative Montana State University and Idaho National Laboratory project. Colonies of algae exhibit many characteristics seen in bacterial biofilms: adherence; detachment and sloughing; difference in structure of an attached colony; varying strength of attachment on different surfaces; association of other organisms in an EPS matrix; and the heterogeneous nature of attached colonies. The characterization of a microbial fuel cell was completed in less than 30 minutes using an empirical procedure to predict the maximum sustainable power that can be generated by a microbial fuel cell over a short period of time. In this procedure, the external resistance was changed incrementally, in steps of 500 ohms every 60 seconds, and the anode potential, the cathode potential, and the cell current were measured. This procedure highlights the inherent limitations of energy conversion in a microbial fuel cell. A voltage/current characterization of the microbial fuel was also completed from the data collected. This dissertation also includes the evaluation of A Hands-On Introduction to Microbial Fuel Cells, a laboratory developed for an introductory chemical and biological engineering course. The experiment has been updated to include a voltage/current characterization of the microbial fuel cell. Learning objectives have been identified and pre- and post-laboratory activities have been developed for further implementation into a chemical and biological engineering curriculum.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/menicucci/MenicucciJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems American Indian/Alaska Native adult patients face when attempting the long term self management of their type II diabetes disease process</field><field name="creator">Merchant, Nicole Dawn</field><field name="description">The American Indian/Alaska Natives people are plagued by Type II Diabetes. The poor management of this disease process has dire effects on the morbidity and mortality of this population. It is imperative to identify the challenges that this group of people face with the self-management of Type II Diabetes. The conceptual framework for this study was based on Dorothea Orem's health deviation of self-care requisites. These health deviations result from the disease state and are used for diagnosis and treatment (Orem, 1985). The literature review and the discussion of results with the relevant literature were organized according to Orem's six themes of health deviations in the self-management. A qualitative research method, involving open-ended interviews with five Native American participants, was used. The participants were asked questions regarding their diagnosis, challenges in self-management, knowledge of long term effects, and additional needed resources. The data were analyzed using Luborsky's (1994), method of thematic analysis to identify the challenges Native American adults encounter in the self-management of Type II Diabetes, resulting in 8 topics. These included: a) feelings about Type II Diabetes diagnosis and the implications for lifestyle changes, b) prior experiences with family who have Type II Diabetes, c) challenges and lifestyle changes in managing Type II Diabetes, d) personal contributing factors to poor management, e) support systems for managing Type II Diabetes, f) identification of good management of Type II Diabetes, g) knowledge of long term effects of Type II Diabetes, h) additional support and resources needed to manage Type II Diabetes. Diabetes is a complex disease process that requires ongoing education and consistent medical care. It is essential that health care providers evaluate and tailor their care to the challenges of their patient population to improve the health status of those with Type II Diabetes.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/merchant/MerchantN0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the impact on the professional learning of graduates of a science and pedagogical content knowledge-based graduate degree program</field><field name="creator">Mike, Alyson Mary</field><field name="description">This study examined the professional learning of participants in a science and pedagogical content knowledge-based graduate degree program, specifically the Master of Science in Science Education (MSSE) at Montana State University. The program's blended learning model includes distance learning coursework and laboratory, field and seminar experiences. Three-quarters of the faculty are scientists. The study sought to identify program components that contribute to a graduate course of study that is coherent, has academic rigor, and contributes to educator's professional growth and learning. The study examined the program from three perspectives: recommendations for teachers' professional learning through professional development, components of a quality graduate program, and a framework for distance learning. No large-scale studies on comprehensive models of teacher professional learning leading to change in practice have been conducted in the United States. The literature on teachers' professional learning is small. Beginning with a comprehensive review of the literature, this study sought to identify components of professional learning through professional development for teachers. The MSSE professional learning survey was designed for students and faculty, and 349 students and 24 faculty responded. The student survey explored how course experiences fostered professional learning. Open-ended responses on the student survey provided insight regarding specific program experiences influencing key categories of professional learning. A parallel faculty survey was designed to elicit faculty perspectives on the extent to which their courses fostered science content knowledge and other aspects of professional learning. Case study data and portfolios from MSSE students were used to provide deeper insights into the influential aspects of the program. The study provided evidence of significant professional learning among science teacher participants. This growth occurred in key categories defined in the literature including inquiry, building social capital, critical and responsive learning, valuing learning and building content knowledge. In general, findings from students and faculty were well aligned. Based on respondents' recommendations, the author recommended a stronger emphasis on pedagogical content knowledge, analysis of student work, and strategies for differentiating instruction for diverse learners. Conclusions include a framework and roadmap elements to inform those working to improve graduate education or professional development for science teachers.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/mike/MikeA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences of chemical speciation and solid phase partitioning on microbial toxicity: single organism to in situ community response</field><field name="creator">Moberly, James Gill</field><field name="description">The waters and sediments of Lake Coeur d'Alene (LCDA) in northern Idaho have been contaminated by heavy metals because of decades of mining operations. Metal speciation is critical in assessing toxicity because it may vary considerably with pH and is dependent on other aqueous constituents. There has been little research on integrated investigations of the effects of heavy metal speciation on indigenous microbes from LCDA, especially large scale community analysis. The focus of this research in the LCDA system was to determine the effect of heavy metal speciation on toxicity, first in a defined single organism system, followed by in situ studies. Combined results of thermodynamic modeling, statistical analysis, and batch culture studies using Arthrobacter sp. JM018 suggest that the toxic species is not solely limited to the free ion, but also includes ZnHPO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;deg;(aq). Cellular uptake of ZnHPO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;deg;(aq) through the inorganic phosphate transporter (pit family), which requires a neutral metal phosphate complex for phosphate transport, may explain the observed toxicity. These findings show the important role of "minor" Zn species in organism toxicity and have wider implications since the pit inorganic phosphate transport system is widely distributed in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. Using a multivariate statistical approach, correlations between the microbial community (via 16S rDNA microarray) in sediment cores and operationally defined heavy metal phases (via continuous sequential extractions) were explored. Candidate phyla NC10, OP8 and LD1PA were only present in metal contaminated cores and diversity doubled among Natronoanaerobium in metal contaminated cores which may suggest some increased fitness of these phyla in contaminated sediments. Correlations show decreases in diversity from presumed sulfate reducing lineages within most taxa from Desulfovibrionales and Bdellovibrionales and from metal reducing bacterial lineages Shewanellaceae, Geobacteraceae, and Rhodocyclaceae with increases in the ratio of more bioavailable Pb exchangeable/carbonate to less bioavailable Pb oxyhydroxide. This is the first time these techniques have been used in combination to describe a contaminated system.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/moberly/MoberlyJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and interaction of Fusarium crown rot and common root rot pathogens of wheat in Montana and development of an integrated management program for Fusarium crown rot</field><field name="creator">Moya, Ernesto Antonio</field><field name="description">This thesis had three objectives: i) Determining distribution of FCR and common root rot (CRR) of wheat in Montana; ii) Determining population dynamics between F. pseudograminearum and Bipolaris sorokiniana at different wheat development stages, and iii) Development of an integrated disease management program for Fusarium crown rot (FCR) using biological and fungicide seed treatments, cultivar resistance, and induced systemic resistance (SAR). Surveys of 91 fields over two years using qPCR identified FCR in 57% and CRR in 93% of the fields surveyed. Bipolaris sorokiniana, F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum were isolated from 15, 13 and 8% of tillers respectively. FCR distribution was highly clustered while CRR was uniformly distributed with soil type, elevation and growing degree days influencing distribution. Data from intensively sampled fields estimated yield losses caused by FCR and CRR at 3.2 to 34.9% with losses influenced by pathogen population. This study is the first time qPCR was used to survey the distribution of FCR and CRR and to study the interaction of the respective pathogens. The effect of F. pseudograminearum and B. sorokiniana inoculum applied singly or in combination at three rates showed high and low rates of F. pseudograminearum inoculum reduced Bipolaris populations, while B. sorokiniana inoculations did not affect Fusarium populations in stems. Populations of both pathogens increased from heading until harvest with Fusarium colonizing stems earlier than Bipolaris. Mixed inoculations increased incidence of infection and co-infection relative to that observed in production fields. Both fungi alone or combined reduced the seedling counts. Grain yield was inversely correlated with Fusarium populations. Difenoconazole-mefenoxam seed treatment reduced FCR severity between 29.3-50% and fungal and bacterial seed treatments were ineffective. The cv. Volt was identified as partially resistant and had the highest levels of chitinase and beta-1, 3-glucanase activity of cultivars evaluated. Induction of SAR by Bacillus mycoides isolate BmJ or acibenzolar Smethyl significantly reduced the severity of FCR compared to water controls. Integration of cultivar resistance plus fungicide seed treatment or SAR induction provided equal control in greenhouse and irrigated trials. In a dryland field trial, integration of all management tools reduced FCR more than individual tools.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/moya/MoyaE0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards better constrained models of the solar magnetic cycle</field><field name="creator">Munoz-Jaramillo, Andres</field><field name="description">The best tools we have for understanding the origin of solar magnetic variability are kinematic dynamo models. During the last decade, this type of models has seen a continuous evolution and has become increasingly successful at reproducing solar cycle characteristics. The basic ingredients of these models are: the solar differential rotation - which acts as the main source of energy for the system by shearing the magnetic field; the meridional circulation - which plays a crucial role in magnetic field transport; the turbulent diffusivity - which attempts to capture the effect of convective turbulence on the large scale magnetic field; and the poloidal field source - which closes the cycle by regenerating the poloidal magnetic field. However, most of these ingredients remain poorly constrained which allows one to obtain solar-like solutions by "tuning" the input parameters, leading to controversy regarding which parameter set is more appropriate. In this thesis we revisit each of those ingredients in an attempt to constrain them better by using observational data and theoretical considerations, reducing the amount of free parameters in the model. For the meridional flow and differential rotation we use helioseismic data to constrain free parameters and find that the differential rotation is well determined, but the available data can only constrain the latitudinal dependence of the meridional flow. For the turbulent magnetic diffusivity we show that combining mixing-length theory estimates with magnetic quenching allows us to obtain viable magnetic cycles and that the commonly used diffusivity profiles can be understood as a spatiotemporal average of this process. For the poloidal source we introduce a more realistic way of modeling active region emergence and decay and find that this resolves existing discrepancies between kinematic dynamo models and surface flux transport simulations. We also study the physical mechanisms behind the unusually long minimum of cycle 23 and find it to be tied to changes in the meridional flow. Finally, by carefully constraining the system through surface magnetic field observations, we find that what is believed to be the primary source of poloidal field (also known as Babckock-Leigthon mechanism) may not be enough to sustain the solar magnetic cycle.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/munoz-jaramillo/Munoz-JaramilloA0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of startle/panic responses due to auditory and haptic warnings in roadway lane departure</field><field name="creator">Muthumani, Anburaj</field><field name="description">Roadway lane departure accidents caused 25,082 fatalities which accounted for about 58 percent of all roadway fatalities in the United States this year (AASHTO, 2008). In order to reduce these fatalities different types of strategies were implemented such as providing shoulder and/or centerline rumble strips, enhancing delineation of sharp curves, removing or relocating objects, eliminating shoulder drop-offs and providing skid-resistant pavements. Of these strategies, the rumble strips strategy has been found to be more effective to warn drivers. But, the drawbacks of rumble strips have led to the introduction of in-vehicle warning systems. In-vehicle Lane Departure Warning Systems were machine vision-based that use algorithms to interpret video images to check the car's current position and time to lane crossing. However, it is not clear if the warnings themselves may be a potential hazard in terms of distracting or startling drivers. This distraction and startle might impede drivers from quickly and appropriately responding to the original traffic hazard. The present study is intended to better understand how human participants react to such sudden warnings given to them to warn in case of a possible hazard during roadway lane departure. Twelve participants (six male and six female) were asked to drive a simulated vehicle and they were alerted with auditory, haptic, combination of auditory &amp; haptic and no-warning modalities during their lane departure. The responses of the participants were recorded using electromyography (EMG) from the deltoid, biceps brachii, pronator teres and tibialis anterior muscles. The results of the study determined that there is no significant difference in EMG activity between the warning modalities except for the deltoid muscle. The difference in EMG activity for the deltoid muscle for auditory condition is likely due to the greater maximum steering response. Moreover, there is no significant difference among warning modalities during the participant's first warning event. Also, there is no difference in EMG activity between genders due to warning modalities. Overall, findings suggest that there is no potential startle/panic response perceived by the participants due to warning systems in roadway lane departure.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/muthumani/MuthumaniA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of metabolizable protein supplementation and intake on cow production</field><field name="creator">Nichols, Bryan Micheal</field><field name="description">In 2008, two-yr-old Angus and Simmental x Angus pregnant, non-lactating heifers (n = 120, initial BW = 448 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 36 kg) had individual feed intake determined using a GrowSafe feeding system. Dietary treatments were based on approximately 85% grass hay and 15% supplement. Supplements contained whole soybeans plus corn (102% MP) or dried distillers grains plus soybean meal (119% MP). After 35 d of intake measurement, heifers were placed into adjacent pens and fed their diets for an additional 50 or 82 d. Upon completion of the feeding trial, heifers were transported back to the ranch, managed as a single group, and production data were measured. Level of dietary MP had no effect (P &gt; 0.17) on calf birthweight, adjusted 205-d weight, preweaning ADG, age at weaning, cow BW at calving, proportion of cows cycling at bull exposure, or proportion of cows to conceive.

Academic professors in conjunction with Extension regional or district department heads were utilized to explore the professional competencies as they related to the preparedness of graduates and new hires, the hiring process, specific job skills, and courses within extension education degree programs. The purpose of the study was to explore current collegiate extension education curriculum and Extension professional competencies in order to improve the preparation of future extension agents and specialists across the nation. Twenty two different land grant universities were represented. Over 300 courses falling into 24 course categories at the undergraduate level and 18 at the graduate level were identified by extension education professors at LGU's that matched the 19 professional competencies presented. Extension administrators identified 65 different sub categories within the 19 competency areas outlining specific skills needed for successful careers in Extension. The conclusions reveal that by working together, Extension administrators and extension education professors can continue to improve their programs so that both will thrive and grow with the changing environment. Recommendations were made for further research in the areas of hiring practices and self reflection by professionals in both groups to analyze their own programs and practices. By utilizing the course categories and specific skills related to the professional competencies needed for success, both groups can work to improve existing programs and structures to ultimately reach success.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/passmore/PassmoreM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetic essence in architecture: a seafarer's memorial</field><field name="creator">Petersen, Matthew Zane</field><field name="description">Memorial architecture should aspire to reflect a universal understanding of the event or persons honored, serving as a means of educating through the tactile experience of space, explaining its purpose as the sculptural medium through which the historic, the present and the future are realized as a ceaseless phenomenon within which the story of the human experience is told. A sense of knowing is the fruit of true memorial architecture, be it sweet or sour, the heroic and the horrific truths of humanity will be undeniable as the warmth of the sun and the firmness of earth, wrought in the very stone of the foundation and cast in the ever lengthening shadow of its form. The essence of memorial architecture is gathered from the ethereal heights of the heavens that move us and the sulking depths of earth that holds us, a monument of mortality expressed with an eternally accepted maxim of human drama. The ideal memorial should function as a two way mirror through which the present confronts the living past via threads of empathic contemplation, transcending the singular experience of the moment to grasp the hopes and fears of our unfolding odyssey.

Eight 11- to 16-yr-old (Trial 1) and sixteen 7- to 16-yr-old (Trial 2; Trial 3) light breed stock horses were used in a completely randomized design to determine the effects of psyllium supplementation on BW, BCS, neck circumference, tailhead fat, plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin concentrations. An intravenous glucose challenge was also performed and the same variables were measured (Trial 3). Horses were stratified by sex and BW and put on trial for 42 d (Trial 1) and 60 d (Trial 2). Horses were individually fed a grain ration at 0.5% BW (Trial 1) and 0.25% BW (Trial 2), hay at 1.5% BW (Trial 1;Trial 2), and a psyllium treatment. Psyllium treatment levels for Trial 1 were: 1) 90 g/d psyllium or 2) an isocaloric control and 0 g/d psyllium. In Trial 2 levels of 180 and 270 g/d psyllium were added. Trial 3 took place the day after Trial 2 ended; horses were administered an intravenous dextrose solution at 0.5% BW after a 12 h fasting period. In Trial 1, horses fed psyllium had a greater (P = 0.01) increase in neck circumference than those not fed psyllium. Trial 2 revealed treatment by time interactions for glucose (P &lt; 0.001) and insulin (P = 0.03). Glucose was lower 90 min (P = 0.05) and 120 min (P &lt; 0.001) after a meal in horses fed psyllium compared to those not fed psyllium. Insulin concentrations were lower 90 min (P = 0.002) and 300 min (P &lt; 0.001) in horses fed psyllium compared to those that were not. There was no difference in glucose (P = 0.48) or insulin (P = 0.15) concentrations between horses on 90, 180, or 270 g psyllium treatments. In Trial 3, horses fed psyllium had lower glucose (P = 0.03) and adiponectin (P = 0.02) concentrations than horses not fed psyllium.

A purposeful review of the literature was performed in order to gain insight into the process of transitioning from student to practicing nurse and to determine needs, experiences, and outcomes associated with newly graduated nurses in acute care settings. Once common intellectual, emotional, socio-cultural, and physical experiences were identified, an educational pamphlet was constructed. The purpose of creating such a pamphlet was to provide useful information, highlight specific common needs, and suggest resources and strategies to supplement newly graduated nurses throughout their transition period and socialization process. Current research shows newly graduated nurses can successfully transition into acute care settings with the provision of pertinent information; the guidance from key stakeholders including, educators, managers, and administrators; and the support of preceptorship, mentorship, and orientation programs. Positive transitional periods are associated with increased reports of job satisfaction and with lower voluntary turnover rates among newly graduated nurses.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/peterson/PetersonK0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constraining massive black hole population models with gravitational wave observations</field><field name="creator">Plowman, Joseph Eugene</field><field name="description">A number of scenarios have been proposed for the origin of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are found in the centres of most galaxies. Many such scenarios predict a high-redshift population of massive black holes (MBHs), with masses in the range 10&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; to 10&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;micro; times that of the Sun. When the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is finally operational, it is likely that it will detect on the order of 100 of these MBH binaries as they merge. The differences between proposed population models produce appreciable effects in the portion of the population which is detectable by LISA, so it is likely that the LISA observations will allow us to place constraints on them. However, gravitational wave detectors such as LISA will not be able to detect all such mergers nor assign precise black hole parameters to the merger, due to weak gravitational wave signal strengths. This dissertation explores LISA's ability to distinguish between several MBH population models. In this way, we go beyond predicting a LISA observed population and consider the extent to which LISA observations could inform astrophysical modelers. The errors in LISA parameter estimation are applied in two ways, with an 'Error Kernel' that is marginalized over astrophysically uninteresting 'sample' parameters, and with a more direct method which generates random sample parameters for each source in a population realization. We consider how the distinguishability varies depending on the choice of source parameters (1 or 2 parameters chosen from masses, redshift or spins) used to characterize the model distributions, with confidence levels determined by 1 or 2-dimensional tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/plowman/PlowmanJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the poetics of the immediate experience</field><field name="creator">Pope, Jaric Ross</field><field name="description">The title of this thesis is 'Towards the Poetics of the Immediate Experience' because that should be the quest in attempting to embrace a process-relational worldview. In an attempting to create things we should embrace poetry because it begins to tap into our basic transcendental and mysterious way of experiencing the world. Our immediate and poetic experiences of the world are not only the beginnings of knowledge and reason, but by embracing poetry, we are also embracing a metaphysical and spiritual quality to the work. This pure way, which allows us to both create, experience, and know the world poetically is crucial to understanding a reality that is determined in each moment of 'becoming' and 'perishing' by what is in essence 'feelings'. By 'feeling' nature in its constant and flowing state of 'becoming' and 'perishing' we can begin to understand the 'true' nature of reality. The worldview that supports the universe as constantly in a state of 'becoming' and 'perishing', and interconnected is from process-relational thought. Acknowledging everything as determined by 'feelings', or what we as humans perceive as emotions, which are the true components of our poetic knowledge and found in our basic intuition, leads us to desire an architecture that is truly poetic and spiritual by evoking emotions from the dynamic changes found in nature.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/pope/PopeJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical implications of indomethacin superfused over the capillaries of frogs with activated white blood cells</field><field name="creator">Priebe, Milissa Ann</field><field name="description">Treatment for inflammation is controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of indomethacin on capillary permeability in animals with signs of systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that the permeability of an individual capillary would be lower after a shear stress challenge in the presence of indomethacin when evidence of systemic infection was present in the animal. Frogs (n=13) were pithed and the mesentery was exposed, hydraulic conductivity (L p) was assessed at 30 cm H&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218;O using the modified Landis technique after an abrupt change in shear stress. Two capillaries from each frog were used; one was a control and one with indomethacin superfused over the tissue. The frogs showed a systemic infection (nitro blue tetrazolium activation) but individual capillaries had no evidence of rolling or sticking white cells. There was a significant decrease in L p (P=0.002) when comparing the control and treatment vessels. The results of the analysis indicate capillary L p assessed in mesentery of infected frogs, decreased when exposed to shear stress and indomethacin. The data imply that gaps between endothelial cells may get smaller when indomethacin is introduced into the system decreasing the flow of fluids out of the capillary.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/priebe/PriebeM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ego depletion: an economic model of self-control</field><field name="creator">Reddinger, Jonathan Lucas</field><field name="description">Philosophers, writers, and psychologists have studied and commented on the concept of willpower for thousands of years. Recently, behavioral economics has enjoyed a flurry of interest, and many economists have provided research-both theoretical and empirical-to bridge the gap between traditional microeconomics and contemporary evidence. Ego depletion is a relatively new view of self-control, demonstrated by psychologists in an experimental setting, that considers willpower to be a personal, renewable resource that is affected by an agent's actions. This paper proposes a fundamental framework that allows the phenomenon of ego depletion to coexist soundly with the traditional consumer microeconomic model. A formal generalized consumer model is proposed in which willpower is a depletable, renewable, unconstrained resource, and results are derived from specific cases. The conclusions are consistent with the theory of ego depletion, and many of the results illustrate the agent's optimal choices in a way that has not been previously presented.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/reddinger/ReddingerJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ontogenetic series and population histology of the ceratopsid dinosaur Einiosaurus procurvicornis</field><field name="creator">Reizner, Julie Ann</field><field name="description">Histologic studies have been utilized in paleontology to determine rates of growth for several dinosaur taxa, but members of the otherwise relatively well-known family Ceratopsidae have largely been excluded. A monodominant bonebed containing remains of the centrosaurine ceratopsid Einiosaurus procurvicornis Sampson 1995, ranging from juveniles to putative adults, has been found in the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of northwestern Montana. This bonebed represents a drought-induced assemblage, and is hypothesized to represent a single population. The full available range of sizes of tibiae (N = 16) were sectioned and bone histology examined. Tissue types and degrees of remodeling are discussed, and growth lines are used to determine ages at time of death of the individuals. The rate of growth for Einiosaurus peaks at about 3-5 years of age, at which time growth slows, suggesting that this may be the age that reproductive maturity is reached. The nature of the bone tissue suggests that growth in Einiosaurus is still relatively rapid in even the largest specimens, indicating that a fully adult tibia has not been recovered from the studied bonebed, and this bonebed is biased toward juveniles and subadults. Since the bonebed is a snapshot of a standing herd, population dynamics of Einiosaurus, such as survivorship and behavior, are assessed. This information on growth dynamics and life histories of a species has implications for future taxonomic resolution and morphometric studies of ceratopsid dinosaurs, and marks the first study on population histology of a large-bodied herbivorous dinosaur.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/reizner/ReiznerJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On mutation and crossover in the theory of evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="creator">Richter, James Neal</field><field name="description">The Evolutionary Algorithm is a population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm. The EA employs mutation, crossover and selection operators inspired by biological evolution. It is commonly applied to find exact or approximate solutions to combinatorial search and optimization problems. This dissertation describes a series of theoretical and experimental studies on a variety of evolutionary algorithms and models of those algorithms. The effects of the crossover and mutation operators are analyzed. Multiple examples of deceptive fitness functions are given where the crossover operator is shown or proven to be detrimental to the speedy optimization of a function. While other research monographs have shown the benefits of crossover on various fitness functions, this is one of the few (or only) doing the inverse. A background literature review is given of both population genetics and evolutionary computation with a focus on results and opinions on the relative merits of crossover and mutation. Next, a family of new fitness functions is introduced and proven to be difficult for crossover to optimize. This is followed by the construction and evaluation of executable theoretical models of EAs in order to explore the effects of parameterized mutation and crossover. These models link the EA to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Dynamical systems analysis is performed on models of EAs to explore their attributes and fixed points. Additional crossover deceptive functions are shown and analyzed to examine the movement of fixed points under changing parameters. Finally, a set of online adaptive parameter experiments with common fitness functions is presented.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/richter/RichterJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myths and misconceptions: exploring beliefs about pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases in adolescents</field><field name="creator">Robertus, Kacie Taylor</field><field name="description">The purpose of this professional project was to explore myths and misconceptions about sexual activity in adolescents. Adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are a significant problem worldwide and have been studied for many decades (Kirby, 2002). The burden of treating pregnancy and STD in the adolescent population affects all aspects of healthcare. Because of the magnitude of the problem, prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among adolescents has become a national priority (McBride &amp; Gienapp 2000). A review of literature was conducted focusing on education, current myths and misconceptions of sexual activity, STD and pregnancy. A survey was created based on the literature. The questions asked were pregnancy or STD related and focused on fertility, condom use, and STD transmission. A convenience sample of four female and three male adolescents aged 15-18 participated. Important preliminary results were provided by the survey. Survey results indicated a high number of incorrect responses. Questions regarding pregnancy were the most frequently missed while questions about STD were answered correctly by most participants. Sample size was small, so generalization is impossible. However, knowing that these adolescents had limited knowledge about pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases may encourage inclusion about these topics in future educational programs for adolescents.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/robertus/RobertusK0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing best practices of removing snow and ice from California roadways</field><field name="creator">Rochelle, Tiffany Ann</field><field name="description">The recent legislation requiring the reduction of salt usage in California prompted the California Department of Transportation to investigate the best practices for winter maintenance using alternative chemicals. The objective of this research was to develop guidelines for optimal snow and ice removal operations designed specifically for California's typical highway environments. In particular, the research effort 1) synthesized information regarding winter maintenance best practices, and 2) designed and constructed an apparatus based on current practices, to perform a load-controlled anti-icing test in a controlled laboratory environment. These experiments were used to determine best practices for applying anti-icing chemicals to roads for three precipitation scenarios. Of specific importance is the temperature at which the bond between the precipitation and the road surface can be easily broken by a snowplow. The pavement samples and snow were conditioned by subjecting them to temperatures associated with each storm scenario. Chemical and snow were then applied to the pavement samples using a highly calibrated spray nozzle. Samples were placed on the temperature-controlled plow table, loaded with transverse and normal forces, and subjected to a warming cycle. Pavement temperature at the moment the ice bond was broken from the pavement was recorded, as well as a relative friction value of the pavement surface. The data available from the experiments was studied in an effort to correlate changes in the chemical performance with the various pavement types, application rates and storm scenarios, and then further to evaluate the relative performance of the five chemical types. A review and analysis of the friction and temperature data was performed. The primary conclusion from the analysis was that the presence of chemical, regardless of chemical type, increased the friction of the pavement surface and reduced the shearing temperature as compared to non-chemically treated substrates for all pavement types, all application rates and all storm scenarios. A secondary conclusion is that less chemical is required to prevent a bond on asphalt than on concrete. Although the behavior of all five chemicals was similar in nearly all respects, a few nominal differences were observed between them.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/rochelle/RochelleT0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating spotted knapweed intake of sheep using NIRS technology</field><field name="creator">Rude, Mark Edward</field><field name="description">Targeted grazing is proving to be effective in controling spotted knapweed infestations. Maximizing the potential of targeted grazing requires a method to determine the botanical composition of individual diets of grazing animals over time Fecal near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used to estimate the botanical composition of sheep consuming, leafy spurge, mountain big sage brush, and juniper, but has not been used to estimate dietary composition of sheep consuming spotted knapweed. Fecal NIRS spectra collected from three feeding trials were used to develop modified partial least squares regression equations to predict percent spotted knapweed in sheep diets. Independent validation of individualy developed equations resulted in R&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; values of .22 - .72. An equation developed by combining data from all three trials resulted in acceptable levels of precision (R&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;= .96) and was used to analyze data collected from range fecal sampling trials conducted in 2006. Two fecal sampling trials were conducted in 2006 to determine NIR's ability to detect differences in dietary composition of sheep grazing spotted knapweed infested range over time. Approximately 90 fecal samples were collected on July 13 and again on August 15 from a band of 900 ewes grazing spotted knapweed infested range to determine changes in diet over time. Fecal samples from five randomly selected ewes in the same band were collected weekly (June 22 - August 17) to detect variation in indiviudal intake over time On July 13, 55% of ewes from had 0-5% spotted knapweed in their diets while 44% had 5-20% spotted knapweed in their diets. On August 15, 1% of ewes, had &lt;10% spotted knapweed in their diets and 44% had 20-25% spotted knapweed in their diets. With the exception of July 6, individual intake of spotted knapweed was similar (P &gt; .05) from June 22, through July 20, but was greater (P &gt; .05)from July 27 through August 17 than from June 22 through July 20. These results suggest that the appropriate time to apply grazing for spotted knapweed control is later in the growing season when sheep are including more of the target plant in their diet.</field><field name="date">2010-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/rude/RudeM0810.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron paramagnetic resonance investigations of adducts of human hemoglobin adducts</field><field name="creator">Schwab, David Earl</field><field name="description">Hemoglobin transports oxygen to the tissues of the body. The delivery of oxygen to tissues by hemoglobin is dependent on blood flow, which is determined by vessel tension regulated by local oxygen gradients. Dilation of the blood vessels in the microcirculation of tissues under high metabolic demand is induced by the endothelium-derived relaxation factor, nitric oxide, in a process known as hypoxic vasodilation. Although the means of nitric oxide bioactivity preservation and transportation in the blood are disputed, it is clear that S-nitrosohemoglobin, a nitrosylated variant of hemoglobin, plays a pivotal role. The details surrounding S-nitrosohemoglobin formation in vivo, however, remain uncertain. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, in conjunction with detailed spectral simulation and least-squares fitting, various hemoglobin species which possibly participate in the formation of S-nitrosohemoglobin were characterized. The EPR spectrum of methemoglobin-nitrite, a purported precursor to S-nitrosohemoglobin formation, was determined to be a composite spectrum arising from the presence of two species, the origin of which is proposed to lie in the differences between the distal heme pockets and histidine residues of the alpha- and beta-subunits of hemoglobin. By direct measurement of methemoglobin-nitrite by EPR spectroscopy, the weak affinity of methemoglobin for nitrite was confirmed, precluding nitrite-methemoglobin from having a direct role in physiological hypoxic vasodilation. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the EPR spectra of the various species of neat methemoglobin was determined, as was the temperature dependence of the nitrosyl-hemoglobin (Hb(NO)&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222;) spectrum at high frequency. The high frequency spectrum of Hb(NO)&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222; provided additional resolution of the axial and rhombic components of the spectrum, but revealed no evidence of distinct subunit spectra. Finally, synthetic routes to generate Fe(II)NO/Fe(III)-Hb hybrids have been presented, which, among other things, demonstrated that bolus addition of nitric oxide can produce similar results as the addition of time and condition dependent nitric oxide donors. Overall, this work expands the understanding of hemoglobin, specifically with regard to hemoglobin species with possible involvement in S-nitrosohemoglobin formation.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/schwab/SchwabD0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evidence of niche similarity between cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis): implications for displacement of native cutthroat trout by nonnative brook trout</field><field name="creator">Shepard, Bradley Bernard</field><field name="description">To evaluate whether nonnative brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, and native westslope cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi, occupied a similar niche I developed and evaluated finite population correction factor (FPC) methods for estimating fish biomass in small streams (&lt; 5 m wide). These new FPC methods take advantage of the fact that relatively high proportions of the total population are captured and can be measured and weighed during removal population estimation. Biomass estimates for these FPC methods had much smaller coefficients of variation than the traditional method for both field and simulated data. Coverage by 95% confidence intervals for the FPC methods were much closer to the 95% nominal level than for the traditional method, especially when capture probabilities were higher than 0.5. Using simulated data, I found that removal population estimates deviated significantly from true population sizes, but that these deviations clustered near zero when the ratio of captured fish to the estimated number was 0.7 or higher. Six to eleven multi-pass electrofishing efforts successfully eradicated nonnative brook trout from 1.7 to 3.0-km treatment reaches of four streams. Brook trout were eradicated to conserve native westslope cutthroat trout and evaluate competitive influences of brook trout on westslope cutthroat trout. Eradication success was related to stream size, distribution and abundance of brook trout, years of treatment, number of treatments per year, amount of cover, cover reduction efforts, and beaver ponds. Total trout biomasses significantly increased in all three streams after brook trout were eradicated, indicating that brook trout and cutthroat trout probably have similar niches and that interference competition may be occurring. Densities of juvenile and adult cutthroat trout were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and negatively affected by densities of juvenile and adult brook trout. I did not find a difference between cutthroat trout and brook trout density effects on body condition of cutthroat trout. I found evidence for size-asymmetric competition in one stream, but not in another. Interspecific competition between brook trout and cutthroat trout appeared to be as strong as intraspecific competition within cutthroat trout, providing insight into one mechanism by which brook trout might displace cutthroat trout.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/shepard/ShepardB0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coexistent combinations: architectural relevance in the digital age</field><field name="creator">Slabbert, Heber Eben</field><field name="description">If architecture fails to match the acceleration of adaption inherent in networked structures, in regards to basic individual and societal needs, it risks losing relevance as a facilitator of the human existential experience.

This relevance can be reclaimed by striking a balance between these coexistent realities. To be more specific a balance achieved with physical architecture acting as a counterbalance to the shifting virtual domain. The final result sought after is not one of static equilibrium, but one similar to the process of homeostasis, where a system responds to environmental conditions in order to maintain an optimal internal state.

After burial, snow avalanches regularly fail on these layers. Generally, surface hoar deposits when the snow surface is cooler than the surrounding environment; near-surface facets form when the subsurface is warmed by solar radiation and the surface is cooled by radiative, convective, and latent heat exchange. Field research stations were established that included daily observations and meteorological data. In two seasons, 14 surface hoar and 26 near-surface facet events were recorded. Statistical analysis of the surface hoar events indicated three factors that were related to surface hoar growth: incoming long-wave radiation, snow surface temperature, and relative humidity. The ideal conditions for each of these parameters were 190-270 W/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;, -22 to -11 &amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C, and 45-80%, respectively. For near-surface facet formation, long- and short-wave radiation and relative humidity were statistically linked to the events. The ideal conditions for these parameters ranged from 380-710 W/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;, 210-240 W/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;, and 23-67%, respectively. Using a thermal model, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations the conditions that lead to facet formation were explored. Based on computed mass-flux, the formation of surface hoar was mainly driven by changes in long-wave radiation, air temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity. From these terms graphical tools were developed to predict surface hoar; the numerical results matched reasonably well with the field observations. Based on the presence of a specific temperature gradient understood to lead to near-surface facets, three terms were determined to be the most influential: density, thermal conductivity, and incoming long-wave radiation. Using these terms, albedo, and incoming short-wave radiation--a requirement for radiation-recrystallization--a means for predicting the presence of near-surface facets was presented. The physical and analytical data presented indicates that incoming long-wave radiation is the most influential parameter governing the conditions that lead to surface hoar and near-surface facet growth. The analysis suggests that snow with low density and high thermal conductivity may be conducive to the formation of near-surface facets.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/slaughter/SlaughterA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of action and inaction goals on the use of cognitive heuristics</field><field name="creator">Sollars, Christopher Mark</field><field name="description">Cognitive heuristics are "rules of thumb" individuals use to complete a task or arrive at a decision with relatively small amounts of mental effort (Simon, 1990). Therefore, if individuals are effortfully processing information, they might be less likely to rely on cognitive heuristics to make decisions and form judgments. Along those lines, previous research on action and inaction goals has revealed that action-primed individuals rely on effortful or less effortful cognitive processes to form judgments or decisions, depending on the situation. For instance, Albarracin et al. (2008) showed that individuals primed with action (versus inaction) engaged in more effortful thought as evidenced by greater correct recall of a text book passage. However, Albarracin and Handley (2009) demonstrated that individuals primed with action (versus inaction) processed a persuasive message less when they already had a pre-existing attitude toward the message topic. Given that action goals can result in more or less cognitive effort, it appears reasonable to predict that action goals can sometimes lead to more or less reliance on cognitive heuristics. Further, action goals might accentuate the dominant cognitive activity of a given situation. Therefore, action (versus inaction) goals should increase thinking for situations in which individuals think, but increase use of cognitive heuristics in situations in which the default cognitive process is less effortful. The current experiment examined this possibility using a persuasion framework. Specifically, participants were primed with either action or inaction prior to reading a strong message about a fictitious grain product. While reading the message participants were either distracted or not distracted, respectively compromising or leaving intact their ability to think effortfully. Additionally, the ostensible source of the message was either an expert or a non-expert, which served as a cue participants could use in heuristic processing. Reliance on cognitive heuristics was measured by the extent to which participants relied on peripheral cues (i.e., message source) versus message content in the formation of attitudes concerning the topic. However, results revealed no significant differences in attitudes across conditions. Several possible explanations for these null results were identified.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/sollars/SollarsC0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal entrainment of fish from Hauser Reservoir, Montana</field><field name="creator">Spinelli, Justin Phillip</field><field name="description">Management of fish populations in Hauser Reservoir, Montana, is hindered by undesirable and unpredictable downstream entrainment of fish through Hauser Dam. My objectives were to estimate spatial and temporal entrainment of fish larger than 100 mm total length through Hauser Dam and identify environmental and operational conditions influencing entrainment. I quantified entrainment using hydroacoustics at the turbine intakes from July 2007 to November 2008 and the spillway from May to July 2008. Species composition was characterized using multiple netting gears. I investigated the relationships between entrainment and conditions in the reservoir and at the dam using multiple linear regression. Total entrainment was 145,470 (95% CI = 138,144 - 152,796). About 60% of entrained fish were smaller than 220 mm. Annual entrainment from summer to autumn was higher in 2007 (N = 79,031; 95% CI = 73,861 - 84,201) than in 2008 (N = 52,513; 95% CI = 47,830 - 57,196). I applied species composition by size to the hydroacoustic data to identify entrained fish species, but many fish (N = 55,529; 95% CI = 50,337 - 60,721) could not be reliably assigned to species because concurrent net catches did not include individuals of similar size. Total entrainment was mostly made up of rainbow trout (33.3%) and walleye (30.2%). Spillway entrainment was 16% of total entrainment and was correlated with spillway discharge; turbine entrainment was not. Turbine entrainment increased from summer to autumn in both years, probably in response to autumn turnover and releases of hatchery rainbow trout. On average, 9.0% (SD = 1.2%) of hatchery fish were entrained soon after being stocked in the reservoir. Most regression models were equally ranked using Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample size indicating that a combination of conditions were influencing entrainment. Spatial and temporal patterns of entrainment at Hauser Dam were typical of other facilities in that entrainment varied in response to a changing combination of operational and environmental conditions. Identification of these patterns of entrainment allows managers to evaluate effects to the reservoir population and make more informed decisions.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/spinelli/SpinelliJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of indomethacin on healthy frog capillaries following a shear stress stimulus: potential clinical implications</field><field name="creator">Staigmiller, Carmen Kay</field><field name="description">When cultured endothelial cells are stimulated by shear stress they release prostaglandins. One of the effects of prostaglandin release is vasodilation. The effect of prostaglandins on hydraulic conductivity (Lp) is not known. Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is known to block prostaglandins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of indomethacin on endothelial cells of a true capillary. It was hypothesized that in an intact healthy capillary, superfused with indomethacin, there will be a decrease in capillary Lp after a shear stress stimulus. The mesentery of healthy North American leopard frogs (n=16) was exposed and a capillary was cannulated. Using the modified Landis technique Lp was assessed, after a shear stress stimulus, in a control capillary and a capillary that was exposed to indomethacin. There was not a significant decrease (P=0.13) in Lp when comparing the control vessels with treatment vessels. Data from this study suggest that prostaglandins are not involved with the response of Lp to shear stress in healthy frogs. Since Lp did not decrease in the presence of indomethacin, it is probable that other processes are affecting the response of the endothelium. The clinical implications of this study are important because of the potentially devastating impact of the toxic effects of NSAIDs.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/staigmiller/StaigmillerC0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography of lake trout in relation to population suppression in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Syslo, John Michael</field><field name="description">Introduced lake trout Salvelinus namaycush threaten to extirpate native Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park. Suppression of the lake trout population is deemed necessary for the conservation of Yellowstone cutthroat trout. A National Park Service gill netting program removed nearly 273,000 lake trout from Yellowstone Lake between 1995 and 2007. Lake trout population size has not been estimated; therefore, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of the program (i.e., proportion of the population that has been removed). My objectives were to (1) examine catch per unit effort (C/f) through time and catch as a function of effort to determine if the suppression program has caused lake trout abundance to decline, (2) determine if length structure, age structure, individual growth, mortality, body condition, length at maturity, age at maturity, and fecundity have changed as a function of harvest, and (3) develop age-structured models to determine the level of mortality required to cause population growth rate to decline below 1.0 (replacement). An increase in lake trout abundance was indicated by increasing C/f over time. Additionally, catch has continued to increase as a function of effort, indicating lake trout abundance is increasing. Population metrics were not clearly indicative of a response to harvest. However, metrics were comparable to North American lake trout populations where harvest has occurred, indicating that lake trout have not reached carrying capacity in Yellowstone Lake. Results from an age-structured matrix model determined the rate of population growth was 1.1 given the current rate of fishing mortality and that population growth rate would be 1.3 in the absence of fishing mortality. The current rate of population growth is positive; however, it is slower than it would be in the absence of lake trout suppression. Fishing mortality needs to increase from the rate of 0.22 estimated in 2007 to at least 0.32 to reduce population growth rate below replacement. Lake trout suppression is becoming an increasingly common management practice throughout the Intermountain West. Thus, Yellowstone Lake provides a case study for evaluating a strategy to remove the apex predator from a large lake.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/syslo/SysloJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Camelina composite pellet fuels feasibility for residential and commercial applications</field><field name="creator">Taasevigen, Danny Jovin</field><field name="description">The use of wood pellet fuels for heating homes and buildings has been a mainstay in Montana since the first energy crisis of the 1970's. With the increasing demand placed on wood pellet fuels and a steady decrease in supply, alternatives must be explored. Camelina Sativa, an oilseed crop of the mustard family, is rich in oil and pressed for biodiesel. The bi-product, a waste meal, is being tested for many different applications to increase the value of the crop. This research explores the use of camelina meal in multi-fuel pellet mixtures. The meal has a distinct quality of binding to itself with the addition of water. This unique characteristic, along with the high heat output of the meal when burned, led to the advanced research into camelina's possibility of being a major additive in multi-fuel pellet formulations. Camelina was combined with sawdust at 50% by weight and pressed from a KL Series pelletizer. These pellets were tested by the Minnesota Valley Testing Laboratory in Bismarck, North Dakota, against premium wood pellets and the results were analyzed. The camelina fueled pellets offered a higher heat output than premium wood pellets, but also higher percentages of sulfur and ash. To ensure that camelina could be an additive in multi-fuel pellets, testing was done on two different types of pellet stoves with the use of a Bacharach Environmental Combustion Analyzer 450 to obtain emission values. After comparing the results to premium wood pellets, the study was advanced to other waste products in hopes of offering multiple fuels for Montana, all with camelina as the major supplement. To further extend the study, testing of the 50/50 camelina sawdust mixture was performed on a small industrial pellet boiler at the Townsend Elementary School in Townsend, Montana. The results were compared to a testing firm's results (Bison Engineering) on the current fuel used in the boilers for emissions. Results for both applications indicated that the camelina fueled pellet mixtures would be better suited for small industrial applications such as the one the Townsend Elementary School utilizes.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/taasevigen/TaasevigenD0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the dynamics and fragility of culture and optimism for making culture</field><field name="creator">Tahiri, Adelina</field><field name="description">Albanians had established a meaningful/intimate relationship with their environment.

They used architecture strategies to disconnect Albanisns from place, erase memory. DOMICIDE was instigated by powerful elite that very critically planned the Destruction. Communist planners strategically ruined the river of the city "The spirit of the city", religious monuments and social nodes such as the bazaar. To address these issues, I plan to rebuild the Place, rebuild the culture and identity through architecture, and make the ultimate sacrifice of all heroes and victims of all the wars worthwhile. By putting the viewer in the place of witness, he/she would be able to better understand the fragility of the culture and history. The goal is to understand clearly the aims of the enemy and start getting more comfortable with the past historical events, and most importantly, the optimism for making culture. Again, through Architecture, I intend to bring back the essence of the culture and history of destructed places. I plan to integrate these important qualities/essences in our present social environment. I will create a prideful narrative of the past, incorporating multiple layers of memory and multiple layers of history of our city and the positive way that it can contribute in our social understanding and social importance. I will intend to re - Construct culture and place based on the essences of the studied/targeted artifacts. The ultimate goal is to see the optimism of people for making culture and being proud of it.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/tahiri/TahiriA0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining morphological and biochemical parameters associated with ovarian follicular atresia and caviar quality and yield in cultured white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus)</field><field name="creator">Talbott, Mariah Jane</field><field name="description">Harvesting sturgeon Acipenseridae when the ovarian follicles have the appropriate firmness and size is important for the caviar industry in order to produce a consistently uniform product and maximize caviar yield. Therefore, it is beneficial for the caviar industry to detect fish with atretic ovarian follicles prior to harvest, which can cause a decrease in caviar grade or complete loss of the product and to harvest fish at the correct stage of ovarian maturity to produce the highest quality and yield of caviar possible. The objectives of this study were to find a parameter that can detect early signs of ovarian follicular atresia by measuring blood plasma concentrations of sex steroids and determine if correlations exist among plasma sex steroid concentrations, morphological characteristics, and caviar yield and quality. To achieve the first objective, blood and ovarian follicles were collected repeatedly from 15 fish prior to and after inducing follicular atresia. Plasma testosterone (T) was the best indicator of the onset of atresia. Logistic regression models were used to illustrate how a threshold value of T can be determined to decrease the probability of harvesting white sturgeon with atretic ovaries. To achieve the second objective, biological samples (blood, ovarian follicles) and morphological measurements were collected from white sturgeon at caviar harvest (n = 20 per month) for five months. Analyses of parameters associated with caviar quality were limited because 92% of fish produced the same quality of caviar. Plasma E2 was correlated with caviar yield, caviar yield as a percent of body weight, and gonadosomatic index (GSI), whereas T was not correlated with either caviar yield or caviar yield as a percent of body weight. Ovarian fat varied greatly among individuals. Consequently, the ovarian stage associated with caviar yield could not be determined by measuring morphological parameters indicative of ovarian maturity. Post-hoc analyses were conducted to determine if parameters differed among ovarian fat categories. In the future, this study may benefit sturgeon conservation propagation programs by improving techniques for detection of ovarian atresia and offering a less-invasive method for estimating fecundity by utilizing the correlation between plasma E2 and GSI.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/talbott/TalbottM0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of diabetic patients receiving care at the Montana Migrant Council: a descriptive study</field><field name="creator">Teller, Jordan Bell</field><field name="description">Problem/Aims: Although migrant workers face higher rates of chronic illnesses such as hypertension and diabetes, little is known about the specific health status characteristics of this vulnerable population. In Montana, outreach designed to address migrant worker health care access disparity includes community clinics that provide bilingual and culturally-sensitive, preventive care. The focus of this study was to (a) describe the characteristics of the diabetic migrant population who receive services at Montana Migrant Council clinics and (b) determine which information obtained during the patient visit is most often recorded. Methods: This non-experimental, descriptive, cross-sectional study applied secondary analysis to existing de-identified data from the Patient Electronic Care System (PECS) database managed by the Montana Migrant Council (MMC). Sample size (n = 30) was determined by the diabetes registry criteria established in the MMC Clinician's Manual. Results: Although 151 diabetic migrant patients were present in the state of Montana in 2008, only 30 were enrolled in the database and received primary care from MMC during the year. Characteristics such as age, gender, body mass index, blood pressure, and baseline laboratory testing were used to describe this population of patients. Of the 30 patients in the PECS database, 53% were female, 84% ranged in age from 30-64 years old, 60% were Hispanic, and 93% were uninsured. Ten percent of these patients had recorded blood pressures &gt;140/90 and over half had co-existing hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Sixteen percent had neuropathy and/or nephropathy, 23% had microalbuminuria, and 7% had retinopathy. All 30 patients in the registry had a dental exam, nutrition education, a foot exam, substance abuse screening, a lipid panel, and a hemoglobin A1C drawn. Forty percent of PECS diabetes patients had an A1C less than 7.0. Fifty-six percent of patients had HDL cholesterol less than the desired 45mg/dL. Conclusion: Although results of this study agreed with findings in the literature, the MMC population possess unique characteristics including a high percentage of female registrants, a high number of Caucasian registrants, and a high number of annual visits (average of 10 within the PECS registry).</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/teller/TellerJ0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spawning and early life-history characteristics of bull trout in a headwater-lake ecosystem</field><field name="creator">Tennant, Lora Beth</field><field name="description">Bull trout, Salvelinus confluentus, are in decline throughout their native range. Interaction with nonnative species is considered to be one of the drivers of bull trout decline. Bull trout exhibit a variety of life-history strategies and lacustrine-adfluvial bull trout seem to be particularly susceptible to population decline when nonnative lake trout, S. namaycush, invade or are introduced into lakes where bull trout are the dominant salmonid. Quartz Lake in Glacier National Park, Montana, provided a unique opportunity to gather information on the spawning and early life-history characteristics of a bull trout population prior to anticipated declines in bull trout abundance due to lake trout invasion. The objectives of this study were (1) to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of bull trout spawning migrations and associate areas of high redd accumulation to abiotic factors, and (2) to quantify the influence of abiotic factors on the distribution of subadult bull trout in tributary streams of Quartz Lake. Stream surveys were conducted to quantify physical habitat characteristics in the study area, backpack electrofishing was used to sample subadult bull trout rearing in lake tributaries, and redd surveys were used to investigate the spatial and temporal trends in the accumulation of bull trout redds. Bull trout redds and subadult bull trout were found throughout the study area; however, bull trout spawning and rearing appeared to be concentrated in lower Quartz Creek. This area was low gradient, and there was a high percent of gravel and cobble substrates. Bull trout spawning began in late September, peaked in early October, and concluded in mid-October. These data provide important information on bull trout life-history in headwater lakes and provide biologists with baseline data that will be useful for assessing the effects of lake trout suppression efforts that began in 2009.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/tennant/TennantL0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing the local diachroneity of the terrestrial lithostratigraphic KPg Boundary, Northern Montana</field><field name="creator">Turner, Bryan William</field><field name="description">The lithostratigraphic KPg boundary separating the underlying Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation from overlying strata of the Paleogene Fort Union Formation in north-central Montana is delineated at the lowermost coal (Z-coal) at the base of the Fort Union. Since meandering stream floodplain coals record deposition in areally-restricted, meanderbelt environments, the lithostratigraphic KPg boundary is diachronous. To test this assertion, a chronostratigraphic framework, developed using radiometrically dated (&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;acute;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;deg; Ar-&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;sup1; Ar) ash horizons, is utilized to examine the physical stratigraphic relations between strata of the uppermost Hell Creek and lowermost Fort Union Formations. The uppermost (3m) Hell Creek Formation consists of massive mudrock with sporadic coal stringers. The lowermost (3m) Fort Union Formation consists of massive mudrocks with the discontinuous Z-coal at its base. No sedimentary structures are present. Three ash horizons, distinguished in the field by color and mineralogy, were used to establish correlations. The lower and middle ashes have been dated at 65.00 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 0.05 Ma and 64.95 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 0.05 Ma, respectively (Swisher et al., 1993). Six sites are studied. From east to west, these are: Mossbrucker, Lerbekmo, Pearl, Bone Hollow, Hell's Hollow, and Nirvana. Each site was trenched 3 meters above and below the Z-coal and lithofacies described every centimeter. The lithostratigraphic boundary at Lerbekmo is 55cm below the chronostratigraphic framework, 56 cm below at Mossbrucker, 9 cm above at Pearl, 258 cm below at Nirvana, and was not preserved at Bone Hollow and Hell's Hollow. Wheeler diagrams of these sections suggest the Z-coal is stratigraphically lower in the west and higher in the eastern sections. These observations demonstrate that the lithostratigraphic KPg boundary is diachronous implying portions of the Hell Creek are Paleogene in age and portions of the Fort Union Cretaceous in age. Furthermore, this demonstrates that lithostratigraphy provides insufficient constraints on determining chronostratigraphic position. Localized lithostratigraphic correlations of the terrestrial sections are also complicated by subtle diastems. Since floodplain deposition is centralized in the floodplain trough (Pizzuto et al., 2008) and a single flood event has limited areal extent (Aalto et al., 2003), the precision of lithostratigraphic correlations is limited without a chronostratigraphic framework of isochronous event beds.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/turner/TurnerB0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pose of neutrality in social documentary films</field><field name="creator">Van Laanen, Michael Whitney</field><field name="description">From the outset, documentary filmmakers have sought to achieve the unobtainable goal of re-presenting reality in a purely objective manner.

The current mentality concerning rural development and lifestyle must be reshaped in order to adapt to an increasingly environmentally conscience world. Within the built environment is the opportunity to provide direction for this positive change. Through extensive research and study, I intend to create an architectural solution that begins to shape its inhabitant's mentality, behavior and lifestyle by utilizing, teaching, and promoting the importance of nature and its cycles. Thus minimizing environmental impacts and conserving energy while improving the health, happiness, and quality of life of the building's occupants. Considering most of a persons life is spent immersed in architecture, the built environment determines a large portion of its inhabitants impact on the environment. This can be significantly minimized if the buildings, required as a necessity in peoples lives, have less impact on the environment. The future project's location should minimize its residents and visitors need for private vehicular transportation by providing an appealing environment for daily economic, recreational and social activities to take place simultaneously. It is my goal to continuously unite nature and man within the building and its surroundings forming awareness and appreciation for the natural world and its cycles by providing gardens through which residents can each begin to personally establish a relationship with nature. Most importantly, the project should be immersed as close to a natural recreational and wildlife area as possible. Through the resident's interaction with gardening environments, the surrounding natural landscape, and the building's use of natural energies and systems, an intimate relationship and sense of dependency on nature will become ingrained in the people living in and experiencing the building. Community and public spaces will be integrated within the development in order to encourage social and economical relationships while further immersing the architecture into the existing community. Ultimately this solution would encourage and promote positive interaction and relationships between the residents, the Bozeman community, and nature. The final result would be an architectural solution that provides a more energy and spatially efficient alternative to lateral development while embracing, improving, and interacting with the local environment, the central core of the city, and the existing community.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/webber/WebberO0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a cognitive array system</field><field name="creator">Weber, Raymond Joseph</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a design for a cognitive array system for next generation wireless communication systems, combining the techniques of cognitive radios and adaptive array systems.

Towards this goal, direction of arrival estimation, frequency sensing and spectral hole finding algorithms were studied, in addition to a joint frequency and direction of arrival estimation algorithm.

Diverse iconic figures in conservation such as Theodore Roosevelt, Jacques Cousteau and Jane Goodall have played starring roles in wildlife films in order to communicate their respective views on conservation. The common narrative of these films represents a reoccurring motif, or trope, in wildlife film that has evolved over time and prominently persists today- the trope of the Environmental Savior. This trope is justifiably condemned in its predominant form in mainstream wildlife film for casting a white westerner as environmental savior in a foreign ecosystem. Critics charge this trope propagates underlying ideologies of racism, neo-imperialism and western superiority. In this essay I will examine the trope of the environmental savior, and more specifically the character within the trope, in order to better understand the overt and implied meanings inherent to this narrative. I will first define the trope of the environmental savior and illustrate its power to persuade an audience. Then I will trace the evolution of the trope's protagonist, from to the white hunter in early wildlife films to the enlightened scientist that persists in contemporary mainstream television. Finally, I will propose forward-looking alternatives for constructing the trope of the environmental savior, based on my experience producing my thesis film, The Mongolian Marmot.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/winston/WinstonT0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of small town sensibilities</field><field name="creator">Winter, Lucas William</field><field name="description">This thesis will explore the design process of creating a contextually appropriate building by responding to sensibilities gleaned from a series of local narratives.

The effects of the fire treatment on the distribution, abundance, and diversity were studied using pitfall trapping over the course of two field seasons: one before the fire, and one after. Sampling occurred in plots representing three successional stages found in the sandhills, as well as in the unique microhabitat features commonly associated with sandhills and dunes. Specimens were determined to species or morpho-species. A mixed-model was used to assess differences in abundance among treatments and successional stages, for each species and for the coleopteran assemblage as a whole. The controlled burn treatment had no significant effect on overall beetle abundance, but several individual species were affected and species richness decreased significantly after treatment in burned plots. Associations with successional stages and microhabitat were detected for eighteen species. The distributions and habitat associations of seven tiger beetle species are discussed, as along with potential treatment effects and recommendations for increasing the habitat of each species in the Centennial Sandhills.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/winton/WintonR0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lolita last star: a theoretically informed narrative of survivance</field><field name="creator">Young, Micaela Marie</field><field name="description">Common missteps by non-Native writers lead to literary representations of Native Americans as tragic figures slumping towards inevitable annihilation, as museum Indians and simulations of the real, mystical and noble "savages," (yes, this still occurs in contemporary film and literature), or simply as inactive members of contemporary life. Authors also attempt to unveil and profit from sensitive spiritual and personal secrets, and offer explanations that do not match reality, leading to grave offenses, and the continuation of harmful stereotypes. In this respect, Lolita Last Star intentionally avoids discussions of spiritual and cultural traditions, or the actual personal lives of "real life" people, because these areas are guarded for good reasons, and instead focuses on native presence in contemporary American life, in the surprisingly complex, globalized space of the Rocky Mountain West. In other words, the final product is a narrative of Survivance; a concept first explored academically by Anishinaabe scholar Gerald Vizenor, in his book Manifest Manners: Postindian Warriors of Survivance. Survivance, I would argue along with many others, may not be as theoretically complex as it first appears. At its most basic level, "Survivance is a practice, not an ideology, dissimulation, or a theory." The concept of Survivance only becomes difficult when we look to the spectrum of responses to conditions that inspire the need to do more than survive. Survivance is coping, but it is also subversion, creation, amusement, ingenuity, reimagining, the provision of new explanations, and recapturing one's own destiny. The characters and their actions in Lolita Last Star respond in illustrations of full human vibrancy that transcend space and time, definitions, borders, accusations of authenticity, oppression, domination, petty moralities, victimry, and they move us all one step closer to self-sovereignty and human dignity. They show that if anything westerners contain cultural universes and are better for it. The only frauds are the people too scared to step out of their narrow focus of what a westerner, an Indian, a firefighter, or a cowboy is.

This project addresses the following specific problem: given a routing path P, choose which channels each link in P should use and their transmission schedule so as to maximize the end-to-end data flow rate (throughput) supported by the entire path. This problem is relevant to applications such as streaming video or data where a connection may be long lasting and require a high constant throughput. The problem is hard due to the presence of both intra-flow and inter-flow interference. We have developed a new constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. If certain conditions on the path are met, the performance guarantee is 1/4 of optimal. It has been shown by simulation results that the end-to-end throughput given by the proposed algorithm is often within 90% or better of optimal.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/zhao/ZhaoX0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Binding and repair of DNA by spore photoproduct lyase</field><field name="creator">Zilinskas, Egidijus</field><field name="description">Bacterial spores are extremely resistant to chemical and physical stresses, including UV irradiation, which in spores results in the formation of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine (spore photoproduct, SP). While SP accumulates in UV-irradiated bacterial spores, it is rapidly repaired during germination. Spore photoproduct lyase (SPL) is the enzyme that catalyzes the specific repair of spore photoproduct to two thymines. It utilizes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and a [4Fe-4S] cluster to catalyze this reaction, and is a member of the radical SAM superfamily. Presented here is an investigation of SPL repair activity towards stereochemically-defined synthetic R- and Sspore photoproduct dinucleosides and dinucleotides (SP and SPTpT, respectively), utilizing SPL purified from Clostridium acetobutylicum. The results of HPLC and Mass Spectrometry analysis of in vitro enzymatic assays demonstrate that SPL specifically repairs the 5R-, but not the 5S- isomer. The repair rates were determined to be ~0.4 nmol/min/mg of SPL for the 5R-SP dinucleoside and ~7.1 nmol/min/mg of SPL for the 5R-SPTpT dinucleotide. Since SPL binding to DNA is a key step in UV damage repair, SPL binding to undamaged DNA, as well as the 5R- and the 5S-isomers of SP and SPTpT, was also investigated. The binding to different substrates was investigated by carrying out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and time-resolved fluorescence decay experiments. SPL from both Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium acetobutylicum cooperatively binds the undamaged DNA with relatively high affinity (Kd = 4.7 x 10 &amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;sup1; M for B.s. SPL and Kd = 1.7 x 10 &amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;raquo;&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;middot; M for C.a. SPL). The presence of small, acid-soluble proteins (SASP), SAM or the [4Fe-4S] cluster of SPL have little effect on SPL binding to undamaged DNA. Interestingly, SPL is able to bind both the 5R- and the 5S- diastereomers of the synthetic dinucleoside/dinucleotide spore photoproduct, although only the 5R-isomer is repaired. SP lyase binding is stronger to the SPTpT dinucleotide than to the SP dinucleoside, likely due to the dinucleotide more closely resembling the natural substrate in double helical DNA. Also, SPL exhibits higher affinity towards SP and SPTpT than the repair products, thymidine or thymidylyl (3'-5') thymidine (TpT), respectively.</field><field name="date">2010-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2010/zilinskas/ZilinskasE0510.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A simulation research framework for concurrent engineering project management</field><field name="creator">Huang, Enzhen</field><field name="description">In concurrent engineering, project tasks usually are interdependent among each other. Iterations, which are required for the interdependent tasks, make traditional PERT/CPM not applicable for the estimation of the project completion time. In addition, carrying out a large scaled project in a dynamic environment has to deal with various factors throughout the entire project life cycle. When estimating the project completion time, previous research often focused on one subject of interests and assumed the other factors causing little effects on the overall project duration. The objective of this thesis is to develop a simulation research framework to help estimate the project completion time and analyze the major factors that affect the estimation for complex concurrent engineering projects. The framework consists of three major components: 1) Data Collection, where the needed data for simulation are prepared including project task structure, task relations, and quantified team member characteristics; 2) Simulation, where tasks are dynamically assigned to the appropriate members/engineers according to each member\'s knowledge level to the task, teamwork capability, work schedule availability, and learning curve improvement; and 3) Data Analysis, where significant factors to the project completion time are studied by the ANOVA analysis based on the simulation results. According to the findings from the ANOVA, heuristic rules are developed to improve the performance of task-member assignments. The effectiveness of the research framework, the simulation model and the heuristics is demonstrated by an illustrative example.</field><field name="date">2005-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/gsetd/2005/huang/HuangE0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modeling and performance evaluation of soliton-based and non-soliton all-optical WDM systems</field><field name="creator">Kota Pavan, Sriharsha</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a performance evaluation of soliton and non-soliton based all-optical Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) networks assuming the existing infrastructure (e.g., fiber and other physical layer components). The performance evaluation is carried out by a conveniently defined Quality (Q) factor, which is a measure of the signal to noise ratio, and indirectly, the bit error rate (BER) of the system. A solution to the Nonlinear Schro&amp;Igrave;&#710;dinger Equation (NLSE), describing the propagation of light inside a fiber with linear and nonlinear impairments is found mathematically from which the Q factor is calculated for both solitons and non-solitons. We also compare the accuracy of the Regular Perturbation (RP) based method for analytically calculating the Q factor, with that of the standard Split Step Fourier (SSF) method. Results show that the RP based method gives more accurate results than the widely used SSF method for reasonably low power levels. Results also show that the soliton based systems perform much better than the non-soliton systems for typical system parameters in the existing infrastructure for bit rates of up to 10Gbps per channel. In this thesis, we present a sample WDM based optical network with mesh topology and show that the end-to-end Q factor of a soliton system is higher than that of non-soliton systems.</field><field name="date">2008-12-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/gsetd/2008/kota_pavan/Kota_PavanS1208.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of health literacy about complementary and alternative medicine in adult residents of a frontier county in Northwestern Montana</field><field name="creator">Porter, Ashley Erin</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine CAM health literacy among residents of a frontier county. Health literacy levels in the United States have historically been low. CAM use in the United States continues to grow each year. The combination of the two issues creates the potential for poor health outcomes. Previous research indicates that rural and frontier residents have high rates of CAM use and lower health literacy when compared to urban populations. Quantitative research methods and Pender's Health Promotion Model provided the underlying framework for this study. A systematic sampling of 100 residents of a frontier county in Northwestern Montana participated in the study. The data were collected by use of a mail survey that included a ten-item CAM health literacy quiz and was analyzed using the SPSS 18 version statistical software program. The results indicated that more than half of the participants used some from of CAM, either through visits to a CAM provider or a self-directed CAM. Participants reported they most often obtained information about CAM through self-study and about health issues from a health care provider. Greater than half of the participants were rated as Average for their CAM health literacy score. When exploring selected sociodemographics, a significant relationship was found between gender and CAM health literacy. Females had higher CAM health literacy rates. Health literacy about CAM scores were similar between frontier residents in this study and a previous study of CAM health literacy in rural residents. The majority of both populations had Average CAM health literacy.

In an effort to create a nonlethal protocol for health evaluation of freshwater mussels we conducted a series of investigations on wild and captive populations of Elliptio complanata. We tested a method for nonlethal hemolymph collection and found no growth or survival effects in 30 sampled animals relative to 30 controls. We surveyed unionid populations from 19 different stream reaches from a rural region of North Carolina to provide a set of baseline ranges for hemolymph composition in healthy populations. These parameters included hemolymph calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, cell count, glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ammonia and protein. We tested these parameters in a captive population held under relatively uniform conditions and found most stable over time. Delta 15N declined substantially over time in captivity, likely in response to a large change in environmental _15N signatures. We tested health parameters in three groups of Elliptio complanata after three months under low, moderate or high feed conditions. The treatment groups varied in hemolymph glycogen, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus concentrations and in foot tissue _15N and _13C, providing possible indicators of subtle change in nutritional condition. We also transplanted Elliptio complanata from a stream enriched in _15N-N03 to a relatively depleted stream and evaluated the lag time required for mussel nitrogen isotope signatures to reflect new environmental signatures. We found a slow turnover time but relatively little variability compared to water signatures, suggesting that bivalves may be useful indicators of chronic nutrient loading in rivers and streams. We conclude that, with further research, hemolymph can be a valuable and safe tool for assessment of freshwater mussel population and habitat health.</field><field name="date">2003-02-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032003-130125/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant Level Response of Seven Herbaceous Perennials to Diurnal Temperature Cycling and Sub?diurnal Temperature Variation</field><field name="creator">Dubois, Jean-Jacques Bernadette</field><field name="description">Climate warming has not affected day and night symmetrically: daily temperature range (DTR) is narrowing, as daily average temperature (DAT) increases. The potential impacts of combined DAT and DTR variation on plants are unknown. Four experiments were conducted to assess such impacts. In the first two, plants of seven herbaceous perennial taxa were exposed to 18 combinations of day and night temperature for 50+ days. Effects on total plant dry weight (DW) were analyzed with the aid of a thermodynamic model, modified to include two temperature dimensions. Results showed that the effects of temperature on DW cannot be accounted for by variation in either DAT or DTR alone, and that their magnitude is equivalent. The greatest effect of variation in DTR on DW was on plants growing closest to their optimal DAT. Time?to?event data analysis methods were used to determine the relative effects of DAT and DTR on anthesis and death in two taxa. Effects of day and night temperature could be separated for both events, but were almost entirely subsumed into DAT. Although effects of DTR were significant, they only became meaningful at the extremes. Results suggest changes in DTR are a lesser concern for anthesis and survival than for gross productivity. Two experiments were then conducted to assess the effect on DW of temperature variation within each of the two phases of the diurnal cycle. Plants of Delphinium &#215; cultorum and Rudbeckia fulgida var. sullivantii L. were grown for 40 days under 28 temperature regimes all resulting in cycles of 12-h days/12-h nights at average either 15/15&#176;C, or 25/15&#176;C. There were 14 regimes for each combination, during which temperature varied between 5 and 35 &#176;C every 4 hours. Temperature varied during the light period in the first experiment, and the dark period in the second. Few significant differences in DW were found among regimes for either taxon, and they did not produce a consistent pattern. Results indicate that over season?long durations, effects of sub?diurnal variation on gross productivity are far less consequent than those of diurnal variation.</field><field name="date">2005-03-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032005-152319/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of a Decrease in the Mature Size of Female Blue Crab, Callinectes sapidus</field><field name="creator">Davis, John Howell</field><field name="description">The size-at-maturity of female blue crabs is declining and the proportion of very small mature females (&lt;100mm carapace width (CW)) is increasing North Carolina. Decreasing mature size of the female may have an effect on the mating success and mortality of size-disparate mating pairs. To test the effect of body size on mating behavior, I used controlled mating experiments comparing size-disparate mating pairs with similarly-sized mating pairs. Small males handled large females longer than any other mating pair combination; however, no increase in injury or mortality was found. Neither large nor small males transferred significantly different numbers of sperm to large and small females. Size-disparity appears to have no effect on mating success in blue crabs, suggesting that diversity of size-related genotypic traits can be preserved in the population. I also designed a mathematical model to estimate the lifetime spawning potential of different size-cohorts of female blue crabs subject to different mortality pressures. Cohorts of very small females (&lt;100mm CW) that are not subject to fishery mortality produce 5.1 ? 58.1% more eggs over two spawning seasons than larger, harvestable females (127-159mm CW), suggesting an evolutionary advantage to maturing at smaller sizes. I also used the model to estimate the efficacy of a proposed restriction on the commercial harvest of large females (&gt;172mm CW), intended to increase the spawning potential of large females in order to increase population-wide recruitment, as well as the number of recruits that may possess a larger-size genotype. The proposed seasonal (Sept. ? Apr.) commercial harvest of large females produced an estimated 23.2 ? 35.1% increase in egg production over two spawning seasons. However, since the large females compose less than 2% of the population, on average, the estimated increase in spawning potential for the entire population was negligible (0.46%). Additionally, the 5% tolerance of the regulation allows for the harvest of the entire population of large females, suggesting that the proposed restriction will be ineffective.</field><field name="date">2006-01-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032006-152433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Method for Rapid Assessment of Historic Fire-Dependent Vegetation Communities</field><field name="creator">Gercke, Diane Marie</field><field name="description">In the effort to restore historic landscapes, it is necessary to first specify spatially explicit target vegetation communities. Previously, botanists or other local experts have used landscape and environmental factors, historical evidence, and evidence from remnant vegetation to define presettlement vegetation communities on the landscape. Once these communities are defined, they must be mapped in order to be truly understandable and useful. Efforts to map the location of these presettlement communities on a particular landscape are often laborious and time consuming. In this study, we discuss a rapid method for assessing the location of these vegetation communities using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the current science of fire behavior modeling. Fire behavior models are proven predictors of fire intensities across a landscape, considering vegetation, slope, aspect, wind, and weather. Our hypothesis was that these fire behavior models could be used to make inferences about presettlement vegetation community distributions in former frequent-fire landscapes. GIS software was used to find simple combinations of variables associated with vegetation distribution, including soil type, aspect, slope, and orientation to gradient winds. A conventional fire model (FlamMap) was then used to find areas that are distinctly fire sheltered. In a survey of 78 fire sheltered community sites visited on the study landscape, 91% of the areas were considered to be correctly identified based on the presence of remnant presettlement vegetation indicator species. Success in finding a single community as related to a specified range of fire behavior outputs suggests that there is potential for expanded utility of fire models in making inferences about vegetative distribution on the frequent-fire landscape. The fire model adds to the utility of the GIS by considering the effects of fire spread direction and variation in fuel moistures in conjunction with terrain variables. The resulting fire intensity outputs represent environmental effects on vegetation distribution that cannot be modeled solely with a GIS. A final presettlement vegetation layer was completed for the study site, located at Fort Bragg on the Southeastern coastal plain of North Carolina, and compared to a layer generated by an extensive 2-year study considered to be definitive. The results showed an overall map accuracy of 78 percent for the proposed procedure. This output may be used as a preliminary map that, in conjunction with ground-truthing, will shorten the process of mapping presettlement vegetation for use in the restoration of historic fire dependent communities.</field><field name="date">2006-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032006-171428/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building an Essential Gene Classification Framework</field><field name="creator">Saha, Soma</field><field name="description">The analysis of gene deletions is a fundamental approach for investigating gene function.

However, a liquid interface has always been necessary between the transducer and the object being imaged due to a high mechanical resistance at the air-transducer interface. Recent advances in transducers have made it possible to omit the liquid interface, allowing imaging to be done through air interfaces. Because this is a relatively new field, research into ultrasound propagation in air is very limited. A comprehensive model of how an ultrasound wave propagates through air would expedite the study of air-coupled ultrasound for imaging. This thesis presents a mathematical model of two-dimensional linear acoustic wave propagation in air. The model takes as input the frequency and amplitude of an acoustic signal and outputs the pressure field over varying longitudinal and lateral distances from the source. The benefits of a mathematical model over a finite element model are first discussed, then the mathematical model for acoustic propagation in air is developed using both computer simulations and physical experiments in an anechoic chamber. Results are presented and compared to experimental data to confirm the validity of the mathematical model.</field><field name="date">2008-01-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032008-114426/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deriving Efficient SQL Sequences Via Prefetching</field><field name="creator">Bilgin, Ahmet Soydan</field><field name="description">Modern information architectures place business logic in an application server and persistent objects in a relational DBMS. To effectively realize such architectures, we must surmount the problem of effectively fetching objects from DBMS to the application server. Object access patterns are not random; they are driven by applications and user behaviors. Naive implementations retrieve objects from the DBMS as such objects are requested by the application, costing a DBMS roundtrip for each query. This fact, coupled with the growing performance bottleneck of computer storage systems, has resulted in a significant amount of research improving object access behavior through predicting future access objects because throughput will continue to improve but latency will not. Latency will be an ever-increasing component of object access cost. In turn, object access cost is usually the bottleneck for modern high performance systems. This yields unacceptably poor performance when application server submit sequence of relational queries to DBMSs. A reasonable approach would be to generate prefetch queries that retrieve objects that would later be requested by the application. However, whereas some prefetch queries would be beneficial, some would not. Distinguishing between them is nontrivial in practice, because commercial DBMSs do not expose efficient query response-time estimators. First, there is no standardized interface for an application server to force the database system to calculate the costs (e.g., response time) for a given query. Second, we still have the entire roundtrip costs between application servers and the DBMSs to estimate the total cost of query evaluation. Consequently, in current practice, programmers spend enormous amounts of time tuning the queries by which objects are retrieved by an application. This dissertation develops an application-independent approach for generating prefetch queries that can be implemented in conventional middleware systems. The main contribution of this dissertation is a set of application-independent guidelines for selecting, based on application's access patterns and additional parameters, efficient ways of merging the application's data requests into prefetch queries. Our guidelines take the current configuration such as local or wide area networks into account, allowing it to select strategies that give good performance in a wider range of configurations. The ensuing performance gains are evaluated via realistic settings based on a retail database inspired by the SPECJ performance test suite.</field><field name="date">2008-01-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032008-141946/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Job Satisfaction of Full-Time Atlantic Coast Conference Board of Certification Certified Athletic Trainers</field><field name="creator">Geruso, Joshua Thomas</field><field name="description">Despite research indicating high levels of job satisfaction reducing turnover in the working community, there is limited research regarding the factors which attribute to job satisfaction of athletic trainers.

S. and other wheat growing areas of the world, powdery mildew is a major constraint to the production of wheat. Currently, the most effective and economical means of control is to use resistant cultivars. Unfortunately, the diversity of the pathogen population enables the pathogen to overcome new resistance genes, often within several seasons of commercial deployment. Surveys to determine the virulence of the population to a set of resistance genes have been performed in many areas of the world. Often, differential frequencies of virulence at varying geographic areas are extended to infer a putative population structure. Due to selective pressure, virulence frequencies are poorly suited to high-resolution analysis of population structure and results may reflect regional cultivar choices and not underlying population phylogeny. A collection of 206 single-ascospore derived powdery mildew isoaltes were utilized to determine virulence frequencies at varying locations in the eastern U. S. Primers were developed to amplify coding sequences in order to assess single nucleotide polymorphisms within this population, which allowed allowed analyses of the distribution of presumably neutral genetic variation. Dendrograms based on Nei?s standard genetic distance (Gst) indicated clustering of virulence frequencies into northern and southern subpopulations, with North Carolina as the putative boundary between groups. DNA sequence based AMOVA analysis using groups derived from Hudson?s sequence based subdivision test (Snn) support this conclusion. Tests for population richness indicate greater haplotype diversity in Virginia and Delaware; a result with several possible explanations based on the known history of North American wheat cultivation.</field><field name="date">2008-01-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01032008-214715/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring the Relationship between Individual and Contextual Variables with Technology Implementation: Analyses of Year Three - IMPACT Project</field><field name="creator">Shattuck, Dominick C.</field><field name="description">The field of educational technology is continually looking to more precisely understand the relationship between leadership, technology-related beliefs, technology resources, supportive environment and technology implementation in classrooms. Previous research has identified relationships between these factors. However, the types of predictors examined, the quality of the dependent variables used and the sophistication of the statistical tools used have sometimes been lacking. This research evaluated these factors within the context of the IMPACT project a three-year technology-enrichment intervention. Utilizing the last year of the data from this project, this cross-sectional study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the causal relationship between leadership, beliefs, technology resources, supportive environment and technology implementation, which is divided into planning, instruction and student use in classrooms. Differentiating technology implementation is an important contribution of this research as previous studies focused on a particular technology and a specific type of application. We found that teachers&#226; beliefs about technology had the strongest positive relationship with technology implementation. Leadership was found to indirectly influence technology implementation through teachers&#226; their beliefs about technology. When developing technology based interventions, policy makers should include evidence of the technology&#226;s effectiveness to influence teachers&#226; beliefs about that technology.

QTLs were identified for 811 genes in the &lt;I&gt;Eucalyptus&lt;/I&gt; hybrid map, displaying in most cases a simple genetic architecture, with a single QTL controlling up to 70% of the transcript level variation. A more complex genetic architecture was detected in one third of the genes, where up to five QTLs could be identified for three genes. QTL hotspots were identified in both maps, typically for genes encoding several enzymes of specific metabolic pathways, suggesting coordinated genetic regulation.

This analysis included collecting acidic gas and inorganic fine particulate concentrations at a hog facility and at a site ~10 miles away, while the regional impact of hog industry was studied with data, which was obtained from the North Carolina Division of Air Quality, for multiple regional sites (Fayetteville, Goldsboro, Jacksonville, Kenansville, Kinston, Raleigh, Wilmington). This regional fine particulate data was then simulated using ISORROPIA, a thermodynamic model that simulates the gas and aerosol equilibrium of inorganic atmospheric species. The local analysis showed the dominance of the ammonium sulfate aerosol, and the seasonal observations showed the impact of both urban areas and marine areas on this region. While no meteorological trends were seen in the local data, the time series plots showed an environment where regional sulfate plays a large part. While nitrate is present in this environment, it is present 1 order of magnitude less then the sulfate aerosol. The ammonium and sulfate values are highly correlated, and the molar ratio is consistent with the relative values of ammonium, sulfate, and nitrate present. The regional observational data analyses show that the major constituents of fine particulate matter are organic carbon, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and elemental carbon. The observed PM2.5 concentration is positively correlated with temperature but negatively-correlated with wind speed. The correlation between PM2.5 mass and wind direction at some locations indicates the impact of the emissions from hog facilities on PM2.5 formation. The modeled results overpredict the observed results in each case, where the nitrate concentrations had the largest percentage overprediction. The predicted total inorganic PM concentrations are overpredicted by 40-45% of the observed values under conditions with median initial total PM species concentrations, median RH and median temperature. The ambient conditions with high PM precursor concentrations, low temperature and high relative humidity favor the formation of the secondary PM. The model runs of the individual days at the three speciated sites showed overprediction for all species, where some predicted values of ammonium were within a factor of 2 of the observed concentrations.</field><field name="date">2006-02-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01042006-092443/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing Species Composition in Second Growth and Old Growth Rich Coves of the Southern Appalachians</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Barry Clayton</field><field name="description">I compared composition of plant communities in second growth (60 - 80 years old) and old growth rich coves for evidence of reduced abundance or presence of plant species in the second growth communities.

In comparing univariate and multivariate analysis methods, I found that (1) aggregate univariate methods (like species diversity and species-area relationships) facilitate comparison of unrelated communities (2) multivariate methods support comparison of related communities and (3) univariate, multiple comparison procedures readily detect specific species changes within a community .</field><field name="date">2008-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-123757/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Boronic Acid-Based Spectroscopic Sensors for Saccharides</field><field name="creator">Ni, Weijuan</field><field name="description">Boronic acid functional group is used widely as a recognition moiety for the development of sensors for saccharides, due to its unique strong and reversible interaction with diols. The fluorescence and/or UV spectroscopic method are the easiest and most common methods to signal the binding event of these receptors (boronic acid compounds) with saccharides. This dissertation consists of three major parts. First, a series of fluorescent diboronic acid compounds with an anthracene PET (photoinduced electron transfer) system were designed and synthesized (Chapter 1). These compounds can be used as sensors for cell surface carbohydrates, such as sialyl Lewis X (sLex), which are known to be biomarkers for certain cancers. Among these diboronic acid compounds, the lead compound was found to fluorescently label cells expressing sLex selectively. The structure of the lead compound was modified and new conformationally constrained analogs were synthesized. Second, the mechanism of the fluorescent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) system, which was used in our design of fluorescent sensors for sLex, was examined in detail using both density functional calculation (DFT) and model compound fluorescence studies. Based on the study, a new hydrolysis mechanism was proposed (Chapter 2 and 3). Third, novel nitrophenol-based boronic acid reporter compounds, which show significant UV spectroscopic changes upon addition of sugars at neutral pH in aqueous solution, were designed and synthesized (Chapter 4). The design took advantage of the ability of a boronic acid functional group to modulate the pKa and/or the electron density of a neighboring group. These reporter compounds can be used as the recognition and signaling unit for the construction of polyboronic acid sensors for selective and specific recognitions of saccharides of biological significance.</field><field name="date">2004-01-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01052004-165857/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Visual-Based Information Logistics in Construction</field><field name="creator">Nuntasunti, Suchart</field><field name="description">The construction industry has, for sometime, suffered from stagnant productivity, high accident rate, project delays, and poor quality. Research studies have shown that the major cause of these performance problems is the lack of effective communication. This research was launched to investigate the usefulness of a comprehensive information logistics model on construction process performance. In order to test and validate key components of the model, a prototype network system named Visual-based Integrated Wireless Site (V-IWS) was developed and tested on a mid-size building construction project. The system was designed to allow every project participant access to real-time visual images of the jobsite and share information interactively with each other as well as with a central database through the Internet. It was developed and evaluated for 7 months in 2003. During the same time, the communication channels adopted by the general contractor, R.N. Rouse, and on-site meetings were observed and analyzed. This analysis indicated that most of the information shared among participants of this project could be handled electronically by the V-IWS. It was demonstrated that the V-IWS: a) reduces production waste and non value-added activities such as material delivery time, b) eliminate the need for unnecessary site visits and meetings, c) adds significant value to project participants by automatically creating visual as-built and picture archives, d) provides operational how-to training for crew, and e) increases site safety and security through automated monitoring. The system is scaleable and more network devices can be added as the building grows. While this study proved technical feasibility of the V-IWS, it became evident that trust, collaboration and information sharing among participants were critical success factors. Due to the industry?s traditional low-bid competition and aversion to change, it is crucial to understand how costs and benefits be distributed. Value sharing as well as technology adoption process need to be studied in order to ensure successful implementation of the system.</field><field name="date">2004-01-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01052004-212738/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring dinitrogen gas emissions from a lagoon treatment system</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Julie Melissa</field><field name="description">A method for collecting dinitrogen gas emissions from open pond waste treatment systems was developed. The method was critically tested in a laboratory for sources of air contamination to ensure reliable gas measurements. A laboratory experiment was done to estimate the rate at which dissolved dinitrogen would be stripped out of solution due to non-dinitrogen bubbles rising through the water column. A volumetric mass transfer coefficient for the process was estimated for clean water. The gas collection method was implemented in a partially aerated lagoon treatment system for dinitrogen and methane gas sampling. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient found in the laboratory for clean water was adjusted to compensate for field gas production rates, temperatures and wastewater quality to estimate the rate of stripped dinitrogen from the partially aerated lagoon. The estimated rate of stripped dinitrogen was subtracted from the total measured dinitrogen flux to estimate the dinitrogen produced biologically. Results from laboratory testing revealed that dinitrogen can be measured with low amounts of dinitrogen atmospheric contamination (0.57% N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and the preliminary field results suggest that biological denitrification did occur at this lagoon treatment system.</field><field name="date">2004-01-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01052004-223912/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Batting Materials on the Performance of Turnout Thermal Liners</field><field name="creator">Heniford, Ryan C</field><field name="description">The effects of fiber and constructional variables on the properties of hydroentangled nonwovens important to their performance when used as batting components in firefighter turnout systems are investigated.

The microstructurally-based formulation for inelastic deformation is based on coupling a multiple-slip crystal plasticity formulation to three distinct dislocation densities, which pertain to statistically stored dislocations (SSDs), geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs), and grain boundary dislocations (GBDs). This dislocation density based multiple-slip crystal plasticity formulation is then coupled to specialized finite-element methods to predict the scale-dependent microstructural behavior, the evolving heterogeneous microstructure, and the localized phenomena that may contribute to failure initiation for large inelastic strains. The SSD densities provide a representation of cell-type dislocation microstructures and their related processes. The GND densities provide an understanding of the scale-dependent deformation behavior of crystalline materials as a function of grain and aggregate sizes. The GBD densities are formulated to represent the misfit dislocations that arise due to lattice misorientations across GBs, and to provide a framework to investigate the phenomena associated with the grain boundary orientations and distributions. This provides a local criterion of how GB interfaces, such as triple junctions are potential sites for failure initiation and localized behavior. The evolution of the GNDs is used to predict and understand how crystallographic and non-crystallographic microstructures relate to intragranular and intergranular deformation patterns and behavior. Furthermore, a clear understanding of how GB strength changes due to microstructural evolution is obtained as a function of microstructural heterogeneities that occur at different physical scales.</field><field name="date">2006-01-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01052006-204245/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring Conservation Success: An Investigation of Land Trusts in North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Louise Boatwright</field><field name="description">Local land trusts in North Carolina protect land to conserve natural resources and biodiversity, and to provide public benefits, such as clean air and water. However the success of their efforts is commonly reported in terms of the amount of land protected or money raised in support of conservation rather than in measures that describe whether or not conservations goals have been achieved. In order to determine if the conservation lands protected by local land trusts are meeting the goals they were intended to serve, I reviewed published research, literature and methodologies to identify common practices used to measure conservation success. Findings indicate three fundamental processes that allow organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions which are; 1) conducting status assessments that include articulating specific goals and describing the project context; 2) identifying threats to conservation targets; and 3) identifying, developing, and monitoring specific indicators whose status is a measurable reflection of the conservation targets and interventions. I also surveyed 24 land trusts in North Carolina to determine why they protect lands, what activities they perform that would allow them to evaluate the conservation impact of their work, and how success is reported to the public. From the survey, I conclude that land trusts in North Carolina are unable to determine if the lands they have protected are meeting their conservation goals because they are not consistently setting measurable goals, indentifying specific conservation targets, or monitoring indicators that would reflect conservation impact, processes identified in the literature review as necessary to evaluate conservation projects. I identify the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation framework as an applicable tool for local land trusts to use to focus their conservation efforts and develop measurable goals and report their conservation success.</field><field name="date">2010-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01052010-134542/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Terminal Node Controlled Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</field><field name="creator">Raghavan, Sudarshan Narasimha</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research has been to study the influence of unidirectional links on routing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) and to develop a new protocol for routing in ad hoc networks with unidirectional links. In this thesis, we propose and discuss a Terminal Node Controlled Routing Protocol (TNCR) for mobile ad hoc networks. TNCR is based on the concept of source routing and provides optimal routes on an on-demand basis by utilizing unidirectional links in the network. Unlike existing protocols, TNCR uses an end-to-end probing technique for discovering path failures. Propagation of stale route information is accomplished using a source initiated token passing mechanism. A source tagging technique is used for caching routes to enable nodes to learn new routes and flush stale routes from the cache. The protocol uses a reverse caching technique to reduce the number of network-wide broadcasts required for route establishment and a broadcast limiting mechanism to reduce the overhead due to broadcast messages. In order to decrease the per packet overhead due to source routing, TNCR employs a route stripping technique for forwarding unicast packets. The protocol avoids the use of link layer acknowledgements and the intervention of intermediate nodes in route maintenance. Thus it provides a highly efficient, link layer independent framework for routing in ad hoc networks in the presence of unidirectional links. This framework is best suited for ad hoc networks composed of heterogeneous mobile nodes with varying transmission ranges. In addition, the protocol can be configured to operate in a bi-directional mode in which it uses a path reversal mechanism for further optimization and overhead reduction. This makes the protocol well suited for all network topologies. We evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol through detailed simulation, measurements and comparison with existing protocols.</field><field name="date">2003-01-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01062003-190703/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-Speed Transceiver Design in CMOS using Multi-level (4-PAM) Signaling</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Balu</field><field name="description">The design of a 4 Gbps serial link transceiver in 0.35&#181;m CMOS process is presented.

High on-chip frequency signals are avoided by multiplexing and de-multiplexing the data directly at the pads.

Various schemes have been proposed to solve this problem. These schemes depend on the measurement of physical quantities such as time of flight, angle of arrival, time difference of arrival and signal strength for location determination. Measurements in the real world are also affected by environmental conditions and contain unavoidable errors. Statistical techniques such as MMSE have been shown to be tolerant towards such errors. However in hostile environments, attackers can alter the measurements significantly to render these proposed schemes useless. Security mechanisms such as authentication and encryption can thwart external attacks such as eavesdropping and spoofing. However, attacks specific to location determination schemes differ from conventional security attacks and have been shown to be successful even when adequate security mechanisms are in place. Recently AR-MMSE, LMS and Voting-based schemes have been proposed to resist these attacks. A technique has also been proposed for detection of attacker nodes. This thesis presents the design and implementation of a nesC [[8] library that achieves secure and robust location determination using these techniques and provides a simple interface that can be used by high level applications. A working system was built using Cricket sensors to evaluate the feasibility of the techniques along with basic security mechanisms. We measure the tradeoffs between the time required for computation, memory consumption and the accuracy of the estimated location. We also measure the accuracy of the estimated location under various degrees of attack for both 2-dimensional and 3- dimensional scenarios. Our experimental results show that in a 2-dimensional system, even with 2 malicious Beacon Nodes out of 8, the maximum increase in error is less than 8 cm for all three techniques when the maximum error is 2 cm without any malicious Beacon Nodes. In case of 3-dimensional system with 1 malicious Beacon Node out of 8, the maximum increase is less than 20 cm with maximum error of about 10 cm when no malicious Beacon Nodes are present.</field><field name="date">2006-01-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01062006-120251/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of Polyglutamine Aggregation With An Intermediate Resolution Protein Model</field><field name="creator">Marchut, Alexander Joseph</field><field name="description">The pathological manifestation of nine hereditary neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's disease is the presence within the brain of aggregates of disease-specific proteins that contain polyglutamine tracts longer than a critical length. The molecular level mechanisms by which these proteins aggregate are still unclear. In an effort to shed light on this important phenomenon, we are investigating the aggregation of model fibril-forming peptides using molecular-level computer simulation. A simplified model of polyglutamine, the protein that is known to form fibrils (ordered aggregates of proteins in beta-sheet conformations) in the brains of victims of Huntington's disease, has been developed. This model accounts for the most important types of intra- and inter-molecular interactions - hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions - while allowing the folding process to be simulated in a reasonable time frame. The model utilizes discontinuous potentials such as hard spheres and square wells in order to take advantage of discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD), a fast simulation technique that is very computationally efficient. DMD is used to examine the folding and aggregation of systems of model polyglutamine peptides ranging in size from isolated peptides to 96 peptides. In our simulations we observe the spontaneous formation of aggregates and annular structures that are made up of beta sheets starting from random configurations of random coils. The effect of chain length on the behavior of our model peptides was examined by simulating the folding of isolated polyglutamine peptides 16, 32, and 48 residues long and the folding and aggregation of systems of twenty-four model polyglutamine peptides 16, 32, 36, 40, and 48 residues long. In our multi-peptide simulations we observed that the optimal temperature for the formation of beta sheets increases with chain length up to 36 glutamine residues but not beyond. Our finding of this critical chain length of 36 glutamine residues is interesting because a critical chain length of 37 glutamine residues has been observed experimentally.</field><field name="date">2006-01-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01062006-142134/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Models for Templated Mesoporous materials: Mimetic Simulation and Gas Adsorption</field><field name="creator">Bhattacharya, Supriyo</field><field name="description">The complex structures of the Templated Mesoporous Materials (TMMs) are difficult to capture using experiments. On the other hand, detailed structural information is required in order to study the confinement effects and predict material properties. We therefore present a methodology to prepare realistic molecular models of the TMMs using molecular simulations. Mimetic simulations are used to simulate the synthesis of the TMMs resulting in mesoscale models of the materials. Using this technique, we have developed models for SBA-15 and the Mesostructured Cellular Foams (MCF). The mimetic simulations also allow us to study the phase diagrams of the surfactants involved in the synthesis. We have investigated the ternary phase diagrams (surfactant-oil-water and surfactant-silica-water) of model triblock surfactants and have highlighted the effects of oil on the ordered structures. The simulation results for the effect of oil are in partial agreement with the experiments. Next, we devise a technique to convert the mesoscale TMM models into atomistic ones. The method has been demonstrated by preparing atomistic models for SBA-15. The physical properties of the models (pore size distribution, surface area, TEM and AFM images) are compared to the experimental ones. The porosities and the surface areas of the models are in quantitative agreement with those of the experimental SBA-15, whereas the pore size distribution and TEM results agree qualitatively with the experiments. We also present new methods for characterizing model structures including a fast technique for computing pore size distributions. The results from our new technique show speed increases of several orders of magnitude compared to the existing method. Finally we simulate the adsorption of Argon inside the model SBA-15 using Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The adsorption isotherm from the model is in semi-quantitative agreement with that of an experimental SBA-15. The adsorption behavior of several different pore models are investigated, which provides new light on the roles of surface roughness and micropores in determining adsorption properties. We conclude by saying that the pore models developed in this work may be used in studying phase transitions, adsorption, diffusion and reactions inside nanopores, and in preparing new mesoporous material models such as the CMK carbons.</field><field name="date">2006-01-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01062006-163437/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">U.S. International Container Trade: Trends, Air Quality Effects, and Best Practices for Mitigation</field><field name="creator">Keilson, David Paul</field><field name="description">The purpose of the paper is to identify relationships between international trade and air quality, and to identify principles and practices to mitigate the air quality impacts of trade growth.

Yellow perch in Lake Michigan have experienced sustained recruitment failure since 1990 and this has been blamed on low larval survival. Direct examination of factors important to larval yellow perch survival in Lake Michigan is complicated by the large size of the lake (52,000 km2) and the short length of the pelagic larval period (30-40 days). Individual-based modeling is a valuable indirect method for assessing the importance of multiple factors to larval survival. I used an individual-based modeling approach combined with field data collection to test four hypotheses regarding factors limiting survival of larval yellow perch in Lake Michigan. I tested whether larval survival is limited by prey community composition, size-selective predation, advection of larvae into offshore habitat or an interaction of these factors. I sampled larval and zooplankton abundance in Lake Michigan along a transect from 1 ? 32 km from shore in 2000 and 2001. I conducted laboratory experiments to quantify larval vulnerability to predation by three typical predators as a function of both predator and prey size. I also conducted laboratory experiments to quantify larval selectivity for different zooplankton prey as a function of larval size and prey community composition. I used the results of these experiments to develop an individual-based model specifically to describe growth and survival of larval yellow perch. Field data suggest that larval yellow perch are being transported from the nearshore to the offshore zone of Lake Michigan, but the timing of this transport varies between years. Model simulations in which the offshore prey community and the timing of larval advection were both varied suggested that larval survival will be highest in years when advection occurs within two weeks of peak hatch, allowing larvae to exploit offshore prey resources early during ontogeny. The model predicts that larvae will make foraging decisions based on prey availability as well as innate preference and they will change their diet if they are exposed to different prey communities. Model simulations also demonstrated that predation currently may not be an important factor for survival of larval yellow perch in Lake Michigan. This result is because alewife is the only fish abundant in Lake Michigan known to eat larval yellow perch. Experimental results suggest that alewife feeding rate on larval yellow perch is a positive function of larval density; yellow perch densities are currently too low to induce significant predation by alewife. Predation appears to be more important in smaller systems where larval densities are higher and larvae are exposed to other predator species. Larval survival in Lake Michigan appears to be primarily limited by an interaction of prey community composition and the timing during the larval period of offshore advection. Both factors vary between years and a good year-class is predicted when the offshore prey community is rich in cyclopoid copepods and larvae are advected offshore early. Early access to cyclopoid copepods results in an earlier transition from feeding on rotifers to feeding on copepods, which is predicted to increase larval growth and decrease mortality. These results suggest that survival of larval yellow perch in Lake Michigan is affected more by density-independent factors such as physical transport and prey community composition; Lake Michigan more closely resembles a marine environment than a typical lake with respect to larval recruitment processes. The unique aspects of larval yellow perch dynamics in Lake Michigan must be considered when applying lessons learned from analysis of larval yellow perch in other lakes to understanding survival of larval yellow perch in a large meso-oceanic system like Lake Michigan.</field><field name="date">2004-01-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072004-092111/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of Liposome/Water Partitioning Using Electrokinetic Chromatography</field><field name="creator">Barker, Jason Alan</field><field name="description">In this two-part investigation, Linear Solvation Energy Relationship (LSER) models were applied to liposome/water partitioning data determined by liposome electrokinetic chromatography (LEKC). In the first part of the study, LEKC retention factors were determined for a set of 71 solutes including 50 neutral aromatic solutes and 21 neutral drugs using the liposome phases mM DPPG20DPPC80, 15 mM DPPG20DPPC80/3 mM cholesterol, and 15 mM DPPG20DPPC80/6 mM cholesterol. These retention factors were used to determine linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) models for each of the three lipid phases for the set of 50 neutral aromatic solutes and the entire set of 71 solutes. The predictive ability of the LSER model was tested by using the model generated for the set of 50 neutral aromatic solutes to predict retention factors for the 21 neutral drugs. The descriptive ability of the LSER model was tested and used to examine the interactions that control liposome/water partitioning for the set of 50 neutral aromatic solutes and the set of 71 solutes including 21 neutral drugs. In the second part of the study, wo liposome electrokinetic chromatography (LEKC) lipid phases were introduced that approximate the lipid composition of the cell membrane of monkey intestinal epithelial cells. 15 mM PI10DPPS10DPPC30DPPE30SPM20/9.75 mM cholesterol most nearly approximates the lipid composition of the cell membrane of monkey intestinal epithelial cells. 15 mM DPPG20DPPC80/9.75 mM cholesterol replaces the specific lipids contained in the monkey intestinal epithelial cell membranes with the zwitterioninc lipid DPPC and DPPG. The retention factors determined for a set of 50 neutral aromatic solutes using these two LEKC phases are highly correlated (r2=0.99), with a slope near unity (m=0.91) and an intercept near zero (b=0.05). The normalized LSER system coefficients for these lipid phases are also very similar. The LSER system coefficients determined for 15 mM PI10DPPS10DPPC30DPPE30SPM20/9.75 mM cholesterol and 15 mM DPPG20DPPC80/9.75 mM cholesterol were compared with an LSER model generated by Abraham, et al. for human intestinal absorption.</field><field name="date">2005-05-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072005-041518/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Piezoelectric response of spun polyvinylidene fluoride and high density polyethylene bicomponent fibers with carbon black</field><field name="creator">Sun, Moran Henry</field><field name="description">Sensors and actuators featuring biomimetic properties, with linear and angular resolution, good compliance and long term biostability are in growing demand for applications such as synthetic muscles, sensor equipped limps and other bio-engineering designs. Recent research papers have demonstrated that insulator materials coated with polypyrrole or polyaniline and combined with various dopants can achieve piezoresistive and dielectric properties, enabling the detection and displacement of local strains in polymer sheets, textile fibers and fabrics. It is known that composite films made from layers of carbon black (CB) filled polyvinylindene fluoride (PVDF) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) films provide stable piezoelectric behavior in the temperature range from 20 to 140 oC and low tensile loss on exposure to moisture and hydrolytic conditions. However, to date the literature contains no references to the use of this particular polymer system in fiber or textile form. Moreover, since the resistivity of such composites can be quantitatively specified by selectively localizing CB in one polymer phase or at the interface of an immiscible polymer blend, it was hypothesized that bicomponent fiber spinning might lead to similar piezoelectric properties within individual fibers. This research study was therefore aimed first at determining whether a blend of PVDF and HDPE polymers filled with CB could be melt spun and drawn into a series of composite or bicomponent fibers using a laboratory extruder and drawing machine. This was accomplished successfully with loadings of CB varying from zero to 27.7% by weight. The second goal was to determine the weight fraction of CB that should be added to PVDF / HDPE composite fibers in order to optimize their electrical functionality and piezoelectric performance. Analysis of the deformation of the as-spun and drawn fibers in their longitudinal direction during charging and discharging was conducted in a novel piezoresponse force microscope (PFM). It demonstrated that increasing the CB content also increased the ferroelectric hysteresis and piezoelectric constant of the composite fiber up to the percolation threshold of 20.7% of CB by weight. The CB was selectively located in the HDPE phase, resulting in a significant loss of crystallinity in the HDPE phase. At the same time, the PVDF phase was transformed from a non-polar to a polar form. The optimum spun and drawn composite piezoelectric fiber measuring 120 microns in diameter contained 56/32/12 PVDF/HDPE/CB by weight. Under the electric stimulation of a few volts it was predicted to be capable of producing a tensile force of about 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; N for a 350 mm long fiber with 1 mm 2 cross-sectional area. It is anticipated that a bundle of such piezoelectric fibers measuring 26 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in cross-section could generate the force of 0.5 N required to complete flexion of a human distal interphalangeal (finger) joint. The incorporation of CB filled HDPE produces a conductive matrix phase within these bicomponent fibers, which acts as an electrode around the PVDF regions, facilitating a more uniform distribution of the piezoelectric charge within the PVDF phase. These encouraging results bode well for future piezoelectric fibers, which have both rapid electromechanical response and good biostability. Additional larger scale tests are recommended to evaluate the efficiency of these novel biomaterials for use in biomedical and electrotextile end-uses.</field><field name="date">2005-01-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072005-112854/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Modeling of Microporous and Templated Mesoporous Carbons</field><field name="creator">Jain, Surendra Kumar</field><field name="description">We present realistic molecular models for microporous and templated mesoporous carbons that describe the pore morphology and topology in a realistic way. In our work on modeling microporous carbons, we have developed a Hybrid Reverse Monte Carlo method to build molecular models that match the structural data obtained from experiments and capture the correct chemisty of the carbon atoms at the local level. Our method is based on Reverse Monte Carlo with an additional energy penalty term. The presence of the energy penalty term reduces the probability of having unrealistic features such as 3 and 4 member rings, reported in many previous Reverse Monte Carlo studies of carbons, in the resultant models. Hydrogen atoms, which are normally ignored or implicitly assumed in most of the simulation studies of porous carbons, are explicitly taken into account in our method. We built models for 3 saccharose based carbons and using a ring connectivity method, that we developed, we found that the resultant models contain highly defective and convoluted graphene segments. We also simulated adsorption of argon using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated isosteric heats of adsorption are in good agreement with experimental results. Our results show that the inclusion of explicit hydrogen atoms in the model is necessary to reproduce the local structure and adsorption properties of real carbons. In the second part of our project, we have used pseudo mimetic methods to develop molecular models for 3 silica templated mesoporous carbons: CMK-1, CMK-3 and CMK-5. These models include pore surface roughness and morphological defects found in real materials. We performed GCMC simulation of argon at 77K and found that the shape of the experimental adsorption isotherms is reproduced well by our mesoporous carbon models.</field><field name="date">2008-01-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072008-154034/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting graft success and early growth of Fraser fir</field><field name="creator">Frey, Haley Hibbert</field><field name="description">Two studies were conducted to investigate factors influencing graft success and subsequent growth of Fraser fir [Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir]. The traditional time of grafting (late winter/early spring) was compared with eight summer/early fall grafting dates from mid-July through mid-October. Optimal grafting success (95%) was in the late winter/early spring (April) while the scions were dormant and the rootstocks were becoming active. Success of subsequent grafting dates decreased from 52% (14 July) to 0% (20 Oct.). Shade improved summer graft success (52% with, 38% without). Irrigation did not affect graft success or growth. Grafting of stored dormant scion material in summer/early fall was not successful (&lt; 1%). In a second study, success and subsequent growth of Fraser fir cleft grafts were studied in relation to season of grafting (late summer vs. spring), grafter, and origin of scion material (height in the tree and lateral branch order (first vs. second). Grafting in early September yielded only 3% success compared to 70% for mid-April. Grafters had significantly different graft success (86% for Grafter 1 with 5 years experience vs. 54% for Grafter 2 with 1 year experience). First-order laterals from the upper crown yielded the best graft success and growth (except plagiotropism). First-order laterals were better than second-order laterals for all growth measurements.</field><field name="date">2009-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072009-090000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavior of Innovative Precast Shallow Floor Framing System</field><field name="creator">Amortnont, Adam Michael</field><field name="description">Modifications to conventional composite floor systems have been made to increase span lengths and decrease structural depths. The competitive market has also led to the development of systems to improve the ease and speed of construction. Diversakore&#194;&#174; is developing an innovative composite shallow floor framing system comprised of precast prestressed steel-concrete composite girders, precast hollow core planks, and a cast-in-place concrete topping slab. The precast girders are constructed with a cambered u-shaped steel plate along the bottom of the section which serves as a stay-in-place form. A composite section is created using normal weight concrete, draped prestressing stands, conventional mild reinforcing steel, and the u-shaped steel plate. The sides of the girder above the u-shaped steel plate are formed to create the inverted t-beam section and provide an end bearing surface for the hollow core planks. The cambered precast girders support the hollow core planks during erection and the cast-in-place topping slab is utilized to engage the planks and form a composite t-beam. The camber in the girder eliminates the need for shoring during erection and enhances the constructability of the system. A research program sponsored by the NSF IUCRC on Repair of Buildings and Bridges with Composites (RB2C) is currently ongoing at the Constructed Facilities Laboratory at North Carolina State University to evaluate the ultimate strength and serviceability performance of this innovative floor system. The experimental and analytical program includes full-scale tests of representative sub-assemblages and utilizes a layered sectional analysis to predict the behavior. The results of the analytical model and the experimental investigation are presented along with conclusions drawn from the initial phase of the research program.</field><field name="date">2010-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072010-115947/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilizing Rolled Rye Mulch for Weed Suppression in Organic No-Tillage Soybeans</field><field name="creator">Smith, Adam Nelson</field><field name="description">Rising demand for organic soybeans (Glycine max L.), coupled with high price premiums for organic products, has producers interested in making the transition to organic soybean production. However, organic soybean producers and those making the transition cite weed management as their biggest limitation. Current organic weed management relies heavily on cultivation. Cultivation has negative consequences on soil health and producers are interested in organic reduced and no-till production. Rye (Secale cereal L. cv. Rymin) cover crop was evaluated for weed suppression abilities and effects on soybean yield. Experiments were planted in 2008 and 2009 at three site locations. Rye was planted in the fall of each year and killed at soybean planting with a roller-crimper or flail-mower, creating thick weed-suppressing mulch with potential allelopathic properties. The mulch was augmented with one of three additional weed control tactics: pre-emergence corn gluten meal (CGM), post-emergence clove oil, or post-emergence high-residue cultivation. Rolled-crimped and flail-mowed treatments had similar weed suppression abilities. There were no differences between CGM, clove oil, or cultivation at most sites. Rye biomass level was the only independent variable that affected weed control. Rye biomass levels higher than 9,000 kg ha-1 were sufficient in controlling weeds. Organic soybean yields were similar to weed-free soybean yields at rye biomass levels higher than 9,000 kg ha-1. Goldsboro 2008, where rye biomass was 10,854 kg ha-1, the organic rye-only treatment yielded at 2,190 kg ha-1 and the weed-free treatment yielded at 2,143 kg ha-1. Plymouth 2008, where rye biomass was 9,526 kg ha-1, the organic rye-only treatment yielded 2,694 kg ha-1 and the weed-free treatment yielded at 2,809 kg ha-1. On the contrary, at low rye biomass levels (4,450- 6,606 kg ha-1), the organic rye-only treatment yielded 628- 822 kg ha-1 less than the weed-free treatment. High rye biomass levels are critical to the success of this production system. However, at rye biomass levels greater than 10,000 kg ha-1, severe soybean lodging was induced and potentially limited yield potential.</field><field name="date">2010-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01072010-150228/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Integration of the Training Evaluation and Job Performance Modeling Literatures: Confirming BE KNOW DO with United States Army Special Forces Training Data</field><field name="creator">Surface, Eric Alan</field><field name="description">Training data from 1441 graduates of the U.S. Army Special Forces Qualifications Course (SFQC) offered an opportunity to test a multidimensional model of training performance. A three-factor model based partially on the Kraiger, Ford, &amp; Salas (1993) framework was operationalized with level-of-performance training criteria (Sackett &amp; Mullen, 1993) and successfully confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The model utilized the BE KNOW DO terminology from the U.S. Army?s leadership model to describe the cognitive, skill-based, and affective training outcome factors. Several alternative models were tested and found not to be identified, suggesting the Kraiger et al. (1993) version provided the best description of performance. Additionally, the BE KNOW DO model was successfully confirmed for two individual phases of the SFQC training separated in time. Therefore, structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of similar constructs over time. Each construct from the initial training phase was found to predict its counterpart in the later phase. The degree of relationship varied for the constructs, suggesting some were more influenced by time and situation. Two performance modeling issues?the specificity of performance constructs and the impact of overfitting a model to the idiosyncratic characteristics of the initial sample on cross-validation?were investigated as well. Results related to the specificity of modeling performance content were inconclusive. Both the one- and three-factor construct models failed to provide adequate fit. The over-modified model provided a worse fit upon cross-validation in 11 out of 12 cases, demonstrating the importance of cross-validating modified models. An integration of the training evaluation and job performance literatures is presented and serves as the rationale for proposing a general three-factor performance model. The idea that all performance can be described in terms of three factors regardless of the context, content, situation, measurement method, or performance level should be investigated. Future directions for practice and research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003-01-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01082003-010557/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of fertilizer nitrogen rate and time of application on growth and performance of six herbaceous perennials and soil solution nitrogen concentration in a simulated landscape</field><field name="creator">Proctor, Cynthia Lambert</field><field name="description">Herbaceous perennials are planted worldwide in public gardens, and commercial and home landscapes. Little research based information exists on response of herbaceous perennials to fertilizer nitrogen (FN) rate and timing and the potential for loss of applied N via leaching. Therefore, we constructed simulated landscapes and installed canna lily (Canna L. 'President'), coreopsis (Coreopsis verticillata L. 'Moonbeam' ), purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea L. 'Magnus'), iris (Iris siberica L. 'Caesar?s Brother'), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L. 'Shenandoah'), sedum (Sedum L. 'Herbstfreude'), and sage (Salvia x sylvestris L. 'East Friesland') to determine how FN rate and timing affected growth and performance of herbaceous perennials and potential N leaching. Porous ceramic cup lysimeters were installed in situ in each landscape plot 38 cm below the soil surface to examine the effects of FN rate and timing on soil solution N concentrations. The experiment was a 4 x 4 factorial in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Four rates of FN: 0, 7, 14, and 28 g?m-2 N were divided equally into two applications and applied at the following times: 1) winter (Jan. 15 and Feb.15), 2) spring (Apr. 15 and May 15), 3) summer (June 15 and July 15), or 4) fall (Sept. 15 and Oct.15) beginning 2001. Soil solution samples were collected approximately every 2 weeks from Jan. 30, 2002 to Nov. 3, 2003 and analyzed to determine soil N (NO3- and NH4+) concentrations. Data collected in 2002 and 2003 for each species included the following number of flowers, plant visual evaluations, growth index (GI), and top dry weight. In 2003, mineral nutrient concentration was determined for each species. Plant response to treatments varied in 2002 and 2003. Our results indicated that despite statistical significance differences, many differences were small and FN treatments had little impact on the growth and ornamental qualities of these species. However, applying no N may not advisable, as some perennials species did benefit from an FN application during a specific time. Soil N concentrations remained above 10 mg?L-1 for 110 days, 62 days, 52 days, and 192 days when applied during January/February, April/May, June/July, 2002 and September/October in 2001 respectively. In 2003, soil N concentrations from FN rates of 7 g?m-2 N (1.5 lbs?1000 ft-2) and 14 g?m-2 N (3.0 lbs?1000 ft-2) applied in January/February, June/July, April/May and September/October remained below 10 mg?L-1 until the end of the study (Oct. 14, 2003). Nitrogen concentrations increased to 19 mg?L-1, 38 mg?L-1, and 21 mg?L-1, after 28 g?m-2 N (6.0 lbs?1000 ft-2) was applied in January/February, April/May, and June/July, respectively. To cover the needs of a wide variety of perennial species that usually exists in one landscape as well as minimize N concentrations in the soil solutions, we recommend a low to moderate rate of FN (5 g?m-2 to 15 g?m-2 ) be applied in split applications in spring and early fall.</field><field name="date">2006-01-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01082006-144404/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation-based Optimization of Coal Barge Scheduling</field><field name="creator">White, David Elliot</field><field name="description">In an attempt to improve the process of supplying coal by way of water to Progress Energy&#226;s Crystal River power plant, a simulation-based technique was developed to find the best schedule of coal barges.

Without ferrocene addition, pure soot particles were collected. Addition of controlled quantities of ferrocene produced particles containing both iron and soot with iron contents up to 15%. The physical and chemical characteristics of the samples were characterized using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and carbon aerosol analysis. Results indicated that iron addition caused a substantial reduction in the soot aerosol mass emissions and a notable modification of the particle size distribution when the flame was stable. Carbon aerosol analysis revealed an increase in the organic carbon fraction in the iron-soot particles when compared to the soot only particles or to a physical mixture of soot and commercially purchase &#206;&#179;-Fe2O3. Corresponding toxicological experiments involving intratracheal instillation of particles in mice examined indicators of pulmonary inflammation and induced allergic asthma-like responses to samples composed of soot only, soot-iron additive composites, and physical mixtures of soot and commercially purchased gamma-Fe2O3 nano-particles. The soot only samples overall induced the greatest inflammatory response at a time point of 4 hours post-instillation. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and tumor necrosis factor-&#206;&#177; showed trends of increase as the amount of carbon, not iron, in the samples increased. The results suggest that the toxicity of ultrafine particles, such as though from diesel engines or coal combustion, is correlated to the carbon content of the particles, rather than their transition metal content. Future work should examine the effects of other transition metals such as platinum and cerium in conjunction with carbonaceous particles, as well as the toxicological influence of sulfur as compared to iron in the conjunction with carbonaceous particles.</field><field name="date">2008-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01082008-094249/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Application of Mass Spectrometry Methods to Understand Plant Hormone Signal Transduction</field><field name="creator">Kota, Uma</field><field name="description">Mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of proteomics enabling characterization of proteins, their post translational modifications and determining protein-protein interactions. This versatile analytical technology allows both qualitative and quantitative measurements on a large number of proteins that is required to understand the complex molecular biology underlying the various cellular processes such as growth, development and response to stimuli. There are several mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic strategies reported in literature, all of which can be broadly classified into two groups: stable isotope-labeling approaches and label-free approaches. While the stable isotope labeling strategies are well established and applied extensively, label-free approaches are relatively new in the field of quantitative proteomics. The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of both labeling and label-free quantitative proteomic approaches with specific application to plant hormone signaling pathways. The use of stable isotope labeling for phosphorylation quantification was evaluated by the development and application of a new Phosphoprotein Acid cleavable Solid-phase Isotope-coded Reagent (PhASIR) to both model phosphopeptides and a phosphoprotein. The difficulties encountered with this approach such as complex labeling chemistries, presence of by-product, poor reproducibility and considerable loss of sample suggested that this approach was not suitable for quantitative phosphoproteomics. On the other hand, label-free quantification strategies are relatively simple, fast and can be easily applied to large-scale proteomic studies. A label-free, intensity-based quantitative strategy using a unique parallel fragmentation and a data-independent acquisition mode, termed LC/MSE was developed to carry out the functional analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana receptor kinase BRI1 in vivo phosphorylation sites in response to brassinolide treatment. This label-free approach was also applied to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the changes in protein abundance in response to gibberellin treatment in Arabidopsis seedlings. The gel-based, LC/MSE approach termed GeLC/MSE allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of over 200 gibberellin-responsive cytoplasmic proteins with atleast a greater than two-fold change in abundance. Overall, the LC/MSE approach proved to be a reliable method for label-free quantitative proteomics with the advantages of increased protein/proteome coverage, good analytical reproducibility and accurate quantitative results.</field><field name="date">2010-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01082010-033312/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disentangling the Influence of Community and Place Attachment on Resident Attitudes toward Tourism Development.</field><field name="creator">Banks, Carrie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Though there is a wealth of research concerning residents&#226; attitudes toward tourism, little research has been conducted regarding residents&#226; attachment to their community. Exploring the possible links between resident attachment and attitude toward tourism is likely to provide key insights into the root causes of resident attitude. The purpose of this research was to explore the concepts of community attachment (attachment to social ties and relationships) and place attachment (attachment to the physical landscape) as they relate to one another and affect resident attitudes toward tourism development (i.e. a resident&#226;s feeling about the rate of development in their community due to tourism). While past research often blurred the lines between community and place attachment, the current study sought to disentangle the two constructs. Using Ashe County, NC, as a study area, a 47-item intercept survey was used to explore attachment and attitudes. The survey measured three main constructs: community attachment, place attachment and resident attitude toward tourism development. The data were collected in Summer 2009. An exploratory factor analysis of the attachment items reduced into two dimensions: community attachment and place attachment. Subsequent Pearson Correlation tests found significant correlation between the two types of attachment. In addition, community attachment and place attachment were significantly correlated with resident attitudes toward tourism, especially in the areas of economic benefit and urbanization or overcrowding. Residents with higher levels of both community attachment and place attachment were more likely to agree that tourism was causing overcrowding in their community. Finally, a resident&#226;s percent of life lived in the study area was found to be a statistically significant predictor of community attachment and 11 of 13 resident attitude items. The variable percent of life lived in community has not been used in previous published research and was shown in this research to be a good predictor of community attachment and resident attitudes. It is important to note that only community attachment was significantly correlated with items that dealt with economic development and equitable distribution of economic benefits, whereas high place attachment indicated a greater correlation with items dealing with land use. This supports the idea that respondents who are attached to community are more interested in economic development and equitable sharing of gains. Respondents with higher place attachment were concerned with the environmental impacts of tourism such as urbanization and overcrowding, without significant concern for economic benefit. This suggests that in the planning stages, newcomers would advocate for environmental protection and regulations such as zoning, while long-term residents would be concerned about the environment but also take notice of the economic aspects of tourism. This suggests that high percent of life (high community attachment) residents are more likely to take a holistic view of tourism in their community and both its positive and negative impacts. By successfully disentangling community attachment from place attachment, this study was able to gain insights into how each type of attachment influences resident attitudes toward tourism. By identifying the important issues of both groups, positive benefits can be accentuated and encouraged while negative impacts can be minimized.</field><field name="date">2010-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01082010-162020/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural Variation of Hydrology in Nonrivierine Wet Hardwood Forests and the Implications for Restoration</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Yari Ben</field><field name="description">Wetland restoration projects across the United States are failing. Restored sites commonly lack the species and hydrology of the targeted community being restored. A better understanding of natural wetlands would help restoration project designers achieve community composition and hydrologic regimes that more closely resemble natural conditions. I investigated two different methods to identify patterns in hydrologic regime useful to restoration design. The first method was based on success criteria commonly used by North Carolina wetland mitigation projects. The second method was based on The Nature Conservancy&#226;s Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration. In order to test these two methods, I collected hydrologic and compositional data across the natural variation of nonriverine wet hardwood forest stands, a rare wetland community type commonly restored in North Carolina. My results show that hydrologic parameters from the first method, based on current success criteria used in North Carolina, are not related to community composition. Hydrologic parameters from the second method, e.g. the maximum water table level over a 3-day span, explained much of the variation in nonriverine wet hardwood forest community composition. My results found that clear relationships do exist between hydrologic regime and community composition. Hydrologic parameters that are related to community composition need to be used as success criteria in future restoration designs. This will ensure that projects establish the appropriate hydrologic regime necessary to foster the desired wetland community type.</field><field name="date">2010-01-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01082010-164831/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Factors Shaping Haplotype and Nucleotide Diversity in Humans and Malaria</field><field name="creator">McGee, Kate</field><field name="description">Cheaper and more rapid DNA sequencing has led to the accumulation of large amounts of genetic data and has fueled the development of new methods to analyze this data. Using population genetics theory and computational methods we can explore the evolutionary forces that shape genetic variation within and among populations of humans and malaria parasites. Demographic events such as population size change influence current patterns of genetic variation. Accounting for the demographic history of a population is critical in the interpretation of population genetic analyses, particularly in detecting of regions under selection and in making inferences about linkage disequilibrium. Characterizing how recombination rates evolve is critical for the efficient design of association studies and, in turn, the understanding of the genetics behind complex phenotypes. In malaria parasites, recombination is a key element in the creation of a wide array of antigens, which help invade host cells.

Time reversal of acoustic signals in the ocean has been studied for more than two decades with the emphasis on the use of the forward scattered field. All studies share similar geometries where both the acoustical source and an adjacent array of transducers are placed in the water column. This configuration, known as a time-reversal mirror (TRM), is not practical when detecting an object that is located in a different environment than the TRM, such as beneath the ocean floor. Little work has been done to study the efficacy of a single transceiver performing the time-reversal operation on the backscattered signals from targets buried beneath the ocean floor. Here, I start by presenting the theory for such a system in both time and frequency domains for scattering by a sphere. Then by using simulations I show that time reversal of backscattered signals provides a robust method to detect targets buried in an acoustically inhomogeneous sediment using a point transceiver in the water column several meters above the sea floor. Effects of the time-reversal window (TRW) on the iterative time-reversal operation are also presented. I define a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that treats the return with the sphere as the signal and the return without the sphere as noise to quantify improvements to the sphere returns. I consider two different sediment models and angle of incidence to show that the TRO operates independently of the sediment type and transceiver orientation. Theoretical analysis reveals that the time-reversal of backscattered signals converges to a subset of waveforms defined by the target and time-reversal window, not the initial pulse. Analysis further reveals that the time-reversal operator detects the sphere after only two iterations of the TRO, with more iterations enhancing the sphere return through the non-linear filtering property of the TRO. Through this work, I demonstrate that time reversal is a robust method to detect objects.</field><field name="date">2004-01-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01122004-083659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership as Exhibited by a Private Sector Learning Executive; A Descriptive Case Study of Leadership</field><field name="creator">Prafka, David William</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation is to describe the role and leadership of a learning executive [Chief Knowledge Officer, Chief Learning Officer] within a publicly traded corporation.

I relied on in-depth participant interviews, extant organizational, and public data to further my observations. The findings of the dissertation suggest that the researched learning executive was able to influence the prosperity of this corporation as an outcome of his leadership. His leadership can be described as situation-ally dependent, behaviorally complex, and integrative. Two vetted leadership theories are utilized to portray his leadership, TRC and Transformational leadership theories. The results of the research contribute to existing literature in the areas of leadership theory, human and social capital theory, knowledge management, human resource development, qualitative business research, and literature on the role of learning executives.</field><field name="date">2009-02-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Higher Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01122009-200424/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Binding and Local Dynamics of Iso-1-cytochrome c to Substrate-Supported Lipid Nanotube Arrays</field><field name="creator">Smith, Shani Jomella</field><field name="description">A study of the binding and local dynamics of iso-1-cytochrome c to lipid nanotube arrays composed of 1,2-Diheptadecanoyl-sn-Glycero-3-[Phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DOPG), an anionic phospholipid on an nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) substrate was undertaken to gain an understanding of the effects of nanoscale confinement on protein binding.

The binding and local dynamics of the spin-labeled iso-1-cytochrome c bound to multilamellar liposomes was compared with the binding to lipid nanotube arrays. Location of spin-labeled cysteine 102 of iso-1-cytochrome c with respect to the bilayer was probed using an EPR oxygen accessibility experiment.

Dehaloperoxidase has unique characteristics that permit Amphitrite ornata to cohabit with other marine worms that secrete toxic haloaromatic compounds. Dehaloperoxidase has the capability to break down such compounds in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. For example, trihalophenols can be oxidized to dihaloquinones. Prior studies have described the structure, function, and mechanistic behavior of dehaloperoxidase. However, there have been no reports of the electrochemical analysis of dehaloperoxidase. The data in this thesis demonstrates the direct electrochemistry of dehaloperoxidase at bare indium tin oxide and at modified gold electrode surfaces. The gold electrodes were modified with HS(CH2)10COOH/HS(CH2)6OH mixed SAM. Not only diffusional voltammetry has been demonstrated, but also adsorption of electroactive dehaloperoxidase at the modified gold electrode surface. The successful electrochemistry of DHP is attributed to a cluster of lysines near a heme edge, analogous to cytochrome c. Using cyclic voltammetry, a formal reduction potential of the DHP FeIII/FeII heme couple in the presence of dioxygen was determined, which will provide insight into the enzymatic activity of the protein. This reduction potential was determined to be +440 mV v/s NHE. In the presence of tri-bromophenol, an organic substrate for DHP, the catalytic reduction was observed in the presence of dioxygen. In general, this thesis reports the first electrochemical investigation of dehaloperoxidase and explores its interfacial electrochemical properties at the indium tin oxide and modified gold electrode surfaces.</field><field name="date">2004-01-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01152004-144514/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Parental Involvement on Students' Eighth and Tenth Grade College Aspirations: A Comparative Analysis</field><field name="creator">Brasier, Terry Gale</field><field name="description">Following scholarly calls (e.g., Crosnoe, 2001; Perna &amp; Titus, 2005) for studies related to students&#226; academic trajectories, the purpose of this study was to examine whether the relationship between students&#226; college aspirations and parental involvement differs between the eighth grade and tenth grade years, two critical time periods during which students typically initiate and subsequently reassess future college plans. Utilizing base-year and first follow-up data from the restricted-use version of the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS: 88/90), results from fixed-effects logistic regression analyses indicated that parental involvement has a significant positive effect on the likelihood of students having high college aspirations (desire to finish college) during both the eighth and tenth grade years. Additionally, a cross-model hypothesis test indicated that the magnitude of the relationship between students' college aspirations and parental involvement is significantly weaker during the tenth grade year. In conclusion, findings from this study provide statistical support for previous claims that the relationship between college aspirations and parental involvement weakens as students ascend through the educational pipeline. Results from this study imply that scholars should view the relationship between students&#226; college aspirations and parental involvement as dynamic, rather than static, as students ascend through the secondary school grades and, coincidentally, the student college choice process. Additionally, this study&#226;s findings imply that future revisions to federal, state, and school-level parental involvement policies such as Section 1118 of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 should emphasize proactive forms of parental involvement (e.g., participation in school activities, school-related discussions with students), in addition to motivational forms of parental involvement (e.g., expressed levels of encouragement and expectations for educational attainment), throughout the secondary school years.</field><field name="date">2008-02-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01152008-152426/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Highlighting validity and placement of risk information in drug manufacturers&#226; direct-to-consumer web pages.</field><field name="creator">Hicks, Kevin Ervin</field><field name="description">Since the mid-1980s, direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising has changed the way a pharmaceutical company markets prescription medications. DTC advertising has steadily become an integral way of communicating information about prescription drugs to end users and research has shown that the helpInternet is growing as a potential source of drug information. The current study examined the effects of colored highlighting validity (Valid, Invalid and No highlighting) and placement (Top, Middle and Bottom) of target risk keywords in web pages using two kinds of visual search tasks. The two tasks were the same except that in one a target was always present and in the other the target was either present or absent. For both tasks dependent variables were response time and accuracy. The results indicate that valid highlighting significantly reduced response time and increased accuracy across both tasks. Invalid highlighting was not significantly different compared to no highlighting for both tasks in terms of response time or accuracy. Results for both tasks also showed that placement of target keywords on a web page had a significant effect. Top and middle placements significantly reduced response time and increased accuracy compared to placement at the bottom. Findings suggest that valid highlighting and placement above the fold (Top and Middle) of a web page could facilitate consumers locating risk information. In general highlighting has benefits when the sought information is validly highlighted but has no cost when non-target information is highlighted instead. The present findings confirm the results found in studies in other domains. Implications for potential application of highlighting and placement and for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01162008-211129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">P-Coffee: a new divide-and-conquer method for multiple sequence alignment</field><field name="creator">Choi, Kwangbom</field><field name="description">We describe a new divide-and-conquer method, P-Coffee, for alignment of multiple sequences.

The same procedure is recursively applied to each partition until all the alignment columns are collected. In P-Coffee, we minimized the source of bias by aligning all the sequences simultaneously without requiring any heuristic function to optmize, phylogenetic tree, nor gap cost scheme.

However, the capacity of these CD4+CD25+ Treg cells to control immune responses both in vivo and in vitro is not well established. CD4+CD25+ Treg cell-mediated suppression can control autoimmune diseases; transplantation tolerance and graft verses host disease and, in contrast hinder tumor immunity and immunity to infectious agents. As Treg cells have been reported to be involved in several diseases, this study focused on molecular characteristics that enables them to maintain anergy and also resistance to programmed cell death along with the effect of FIV-infection on regulation of the above phenotypic characteristics. Our results show that feline CD4+CD25+ Treg cells are phenotypically and functionally anergic as indicated by elevated levels of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, CdkI&#161;&#166;s, (p21cip1,p16ink4, and p27kip1) , and resistance to mitogen-induced proliferation compared to their counter parts CD4+CD25- T cells. Importantly, CdkI&#161;&#166;s are constitutively over-expressed only in FIV-infected cats. As expected Treg cells from FIV-infected cats that over-expressed CdkI&#161;&#166;s expressed low levels of the cyclins (mainly cyclins D) and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb) that are responsible for cell cycle progression. We investigated the role of TGF?&#210; signaling and found that TGF?&#210;1 plus ConA stimulation was able to convert CD4+CD25- T cells to CD4+CD25+ T cells with functional and phenotypic characteristics including upregulation of CdkI&#161;&#166;s and bcl-2. The differential expression of CdkI&#161;&#166;s and bcl-2 between the two CD4+ T cell subsets may be linked to TGF?&#210;-Smad pathway. Consistent with upregulation of CdkI&#161;&#166;s and bcl-2, we found that although natural and TGF?&#210;1 converted CD4+CD25+ Treg cells are anergic, they are more resistant to activation induced cell death compared to CD4+CD25- T cells functionally which correlated with increased bcl-2 to bax ratio in Treg cells. Thus, the molecular characterization of this unique population of Treg cells may be essential for understanding their role and function for developing effective therapeutics and vaccination especially against chronic infections such as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</field><field name="date">2006-01-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01192006-105756/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biocontrol of Botrytis blight and Rhizoctonia stem rot in geranium by binucleate Rhizoctonia and Trichoderma hamatum as mediated by ISR</field><field name="creator">Olson, Heather Anne</field><field name="description">Three root-colonizing fungi, binucleate Rhizoctonia (BNR) isolate BNR621, BNR isolate P9023, and Trichoderma hamatum 382 (T382) were studied for suppression of Botrytis blight in geranium and demonstration of induced systemic resistance (ISR) as a mechanism of biocontrol. Root isolations of the BNR fungi confirmed that BNR621 and P9023 colonized the geranium root system. Root colonization is considered a requirement for biocontrol. Induction of resistance to Botrytis blight was observed in geraniums transplanted into potting mix amended with formulations of P9023 and T382 2 weeks prior to inoculation with B. cinerea when grown under environments either highly or less conducive to disease development. In the less disease-conducive environment, P9023 and T382 provided protection equivalent (P&lt;0.0001) to a weekly rotation of fenhexamid and chlorothalonil fungicides. The effects of cellular and biochemical changes of ISR on germination of conidia of B. cinerea and Botrytis blight lesion area and expansion rates were tested in vitro. No differences in conidia germination were observed between treatments at any sampling time, with a mean germination rate of 80% across all treatments. The size of the leaf lesion area was dependent upon the length of time between topdressing of the geranium plants with the biocontrol agents and detachment of the leaves for inoculation. In geranium leaves detached and inoculated 7 days after topdressing with a Pesta formulation of either BNR621 or P9023, AUDPC calculated from lesion area was reduced (P&lt;0.0001). In contrast, leaves detached and inoculated 14 days after topdressing with a formulation of T382 had a smaller (P&lt;0.0001) AUDPC from lesion area than plants treated with a Pesta formulation of BNR621. Based on the overall suppression of Botrytis blight in geranium and the reduction in lesion size observed in the detached leaf assays, a role for restriction of lesion development is suspected in the control of B. cinerea in geranium. In a comparison study, induction of resistance to Rhizoctonia stem rot in geranium cuttings taken from stock plants treated with formulations of BNR621, P9023, or T382 was evaluated. No consistent control of Rhizoctonia stem rot in geranium cuttings by a biocontrol treatment was observed. However, cuttings taken from geraniums topdressed with a Pesta formulation of BNR621 14 days prior to propagation and inoculation had a greater probability (P=0.03) of rooting and growing out to healthy plants as compared to inoculated cuttings taken from untreated stock plants.</field><field name="date">2007-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01192007-123849/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CLASS OF A LIE ALGEBRA AND THE CLASSES OF ITS SUBALGEBRAS</field><field name="creator">suanmali, suthathip</field><field name="description">A classical nilpotency result considers finite p-groups whose proper subgroups all have class bounded by a fixed number n.

In North Carolina, 63% of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) surveyed have experienced bulking. Determining the dominant bulking-causative bacteria and their level of proliferation is a necessary step in bulking control. This study used molecular techniques, i.e. quantitative Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) and membrane hybridization to identify and quantify the specific filamentous microorganisms and their threshold values for causing bulking in both lab scale reactors and full scale treatment plants. Filament length of a specific filamentous organism, Eikelboom Type 1851, correlated strongly with the sludge volume index (SVI) and was identified to be the major bulking-causative microorganism in lab scale reactors and a full scale activated sludge plant. The full scale plant is a biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant, a common operational mode in North Carolina, suggesting that this organism may be prevalent in North Carolina WWTPs. The threshold value for Eikelboom Type 1851-caused-bulking was determined. This threshold value will allow the monitoring of incremental improvements in control methods and the delineation of the niche of Eikelboom Type 1851 in activated sludge. Furthermore, the lab scale experiments verified the kinetic selection theory and the filamentous backbone theory for Type 1851.</field><field name="date">2003-01-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01222003-102459/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lactational Exposure of Atrazine and the role of Prolactin in the Development of the Adult Male TIDA Neuronal System.</field><field name="creator">Langdale, Christopher Lawrence</field><field name="description">Previous studies by Stoker et al., (1999b) and Shyr et al., (1986) examined the role of the rat dam's prolactin (Prl) during lactation on subsequent development on the offspring. Shyr identified a critical role for milk-derived Prl in postnatal development of tuberoinfundibular dopamanergic neurons (TIDA) by dosing lactating dams with bromocriptine, a dopamine (DA) agonist, on postnatal day (PND) 2-5, and PND 9-12 to block the release of maternal Prl in the milk. Offspring deprived of milk Prl from PND 2-5 showed a decrease in DA concentration and turnover rate in the median eminence on PND 33-35, demonstrating the importance of Prl to normal TIDA development. Furthermore, this decrease in DA was associated with hyperprolactinemia in male offspring when serum concentrations were measured on PND 30-32. However, no disruption of the TIDA development was observed in dams dosed from PND 9-12, suggesting that PND 2-5 was a sensitive time point for normal development of TIDA neurons. Stoker et al., (1999b) found that exposure of the dam to atrazine during the first 4 days of lactation suppressed maternal suckling-induced prolactin release. Interestingly, this treatment also led to an increased incidence of lateral prostate inflammation in adult offspring. However, prostate inflammation was absent in the male offspring when the atrazine-treated dam was co-treated with ovine prolactin. These observations have led to the hypothesis that decreased maternal prolactin (following atrazine or bromocriptine exposure) will lead to impaired TIDA development and elevated levels of prolactin in the juvenile male offspring (as shown by Shyr et al., 1986 and Stoker et al., 1999b). The two basic assumptions of this hypothesis have yet to be examined and are the focus of this study. First, can an increase in the concentration of serum Prl be determined in male offspring of dams treated with atrazine during early lactation; and second, is there evidence of a decrease in TIDA neuronal activity (DA concentration and turnover) following atrazine exposure? The potential of this herbicide to affect hormones normally present in milk and transiently alter development of the human offspring may be of concern to human health. Lactating females were dosed from PND 1-9, twice a day with 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg atrazine or 0.209 mg/kg bromocritine (PND 1-5). Male pups were selected and killed two hours before lights were turned off (14:10 light cycle). Serum Prl and TIDA neuronal development results supported both basic assumptions. An increase in serum Prl in male offspring of both atrazine 12.5 mg/kg and bromocriptine-treated dams were identified on PND 12 and 35, which was also consistent with prior reports by Shyr et al. (1986). The increase in serum Prl also coincided with decreased TIDA neuronal activity on PND 35. However, a non-linear dose response was observed following atrazine exposure to the dam in both brain aminergic and serum Prl concentrations in the offspring. Also, both compounds caused significant changes in the developmental profiles of dopamine and dopaminergic activity in all three brain areas tested. Although the atrazine data revealed a non-linear dose response in the offspring, the fact that the lowest dose of this herbicide produced changes that were similar to the positive control suggests that indeed this complex mode of action is affected by atrazine-treatment. Due to the complexity of the maternal-neonatal unit, subsequent studies examining the offspring at a later age will be required.</field><field name="date">2004-01-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01222004-143940/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microstructural Modeling of CSL Grain-Boundary Effects and Crack Growth in F.C.C.

Dislocation densities were modeled as internal state variables that provide a more detailed microstructural description of the material?s inelastic deformation and interrelated physical mechanisms that control different failure modes. Specialized microstructurally-based finite-element schemes have been used to investigate the effects of crystallographic orientations of the grains and grain-boundaries (GBs), grain shape and size, (GB) misorientation and the dependency of GB strength and mechanical properties on specific CSL misorientations on the inelastic finite deformation and failure mode mechanisms in f.c.c. polycrystalline aggregates. A Voronoi algorithm was used to generate grains and GBs with random shapes and sizes. The combined effects of GB misorientation, structure and geometry, strain hardening, localized plastic shear slip, intensive regions of crystal lattice rotation and the evolution, interaction and accumulation of dislocation densities on the nucleation and growth of intergranular and transgranular failure modes in f.c.c. polycrystalline aggregates were studied. Results from this study are consistent with experimental observations that microstructures with desired material properties, such as resistivity to crack nucleation, can be achieved by the control of the crystallographic orientation distribution of the grain aggregate and CSL GB orientations. Results from this study show that transgranular failure modes are dominant in aggregates with a high frequency of Sigma-3 GBs, and intergranular fracture modes dominate the aggregate with a high frequency of Sigma-17b GBs.</field><field name="date">2006-01-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01222006-115908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atomic Simulation of Nanoparticles and polyethylene-nanodiamond composites</field><field name="creator">Hu, Zushou</field><field name="description">We examine the size and surface orientation/principal axis dependent stability of nanodiamonds and nanorods.

The MD simulation on glass transition and elastic properties of polyethylene-nanodiamond composites are also carried out in our studies. The results on glass transition show that the transition is a second order phase transition mainly associated with the change in torsional and non-bond interactions. The results on elastic properties indicate that the effect of nanoparticles on polymer composites is mainly determined by the equivalent time scale movement of nanoparticles and polymer chains, which can be improved by either equivalent size scale of nanoparticles and polymer chains or increasing interface interaction, such as chemical bonds at surface. The addition of nanoparticles usually increases the composite density; however, it doesn&#226;t necessarily increase the density of polymer matrix.</field><field name="date">2009-01-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01222009-154007/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Integration of Women into North Carolina Politics: An Examination of Boards and Commissions</field><field name="creator">Whitener, Angela Michele</field><field name="description">This thesis examines women?s participation in politics by utilizing a model of gender integration. This model shows that there are two ways that women enter the political world: horizontally and vertically. Horizontal integration represents the increase of women into politics in numbers while vertical integration requires that women ascend to positions of power and leadership within the institution. The main focus of this study is an analysis of women?s appointment to boards and commissions in North Carolina. My analysis focuses on the number of women serving on forty boards and commissions over an eight-year period. The boards and commissions were chosen in two groups. First, a survey of elected officials and other key individuals was performed to assess the state?s most powerful boards and commissions. The top twenty of these were chosen for examination. Then, twenty lesser boards and commissions were chosen at random. After a statistical analysis of my results, I conclude that women are not making significant gains in their appointments to boards and commissions and I explain this lack of progress as an example of the continuing significance of political roles. Throughout the paper, I explore definitions of gender and how a woman?s experiences may affect her participation in certain issue areas in the political realm, particularly with regard to appointments to boards and commissions. In addition, I discuss women in North Carolina politics from 1920 to the present and give substantive examples of how women have influenced public policy in North Carolina.</field><field name="date">2004-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01232004-153852/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks</field><field name="creator">Yoon, Suyoung</field><field name="description">One of the unique characteristics of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is that sensor nodes have very constrained resources. Typical sensor nodes have lower computing power, communication bandwidth, and smaller memory than other wireless devices, and operate on limited capacity batteries. Hence power efficiency is very important in WSNs because power failure of some sensor nodes may lead to total network failure. In many cases the WSNs have to operate in harsh environments without human intervention for expended period time. Thus, much research on reducing or minimizing the power consumption, and thereby increasing the network lifetime, has been performed at each layer of the network layers. In this dissertation we approach three important issues related power management in WSNs: routing, time synchronization, and medium access control (MAC). We first discuss the effect of selecting routing protocols on the lifetime of the WSNs. The maximum and minimum bounds of the lifetime with respect to the routing protocols are derived. The routing protocols corresponding to the bounds are also presented. The simulation results show that the choice of the routing protocol has very little impact on the lifetime of the network and that simple routing protocols such as shortest path routing perform very close to the the maximum bound of the lifetime of the network. Next, we propose a simple and accurate time synchronization protocol that can be used a a fundamental component of other synchronization-based protocols in WSNs. Analytical bounds on the synchronization errors of proposed protocol are discussed. The implementation results on Mica2 and Telos motes show that proposed time synchronization protocol outperforms existing ones in terms of the precision and required resources. Finally, we model the power consumption of WSN MAC protocols. We derive analytically the power consumption of well known MAC protocols for WSNs, and analyze and compare their performance. We validate the models by measuring the power consumption on Mica 2 motes and comparing those measured power consumption with the analytical results.</field><field name="date">2007-04-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01232007-222425/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Matter of Degrees: an Evaluation of Instructor Concept of Writing Effectiveness in an Adult Accelerated Degree Completion Program</field><field name="creator">Tillett, Tanya R</field><field name="description">Most modern theories of responding to student writing typically advocate a meaning-centered, whole text holistic approach (as opposed to an analytic mode of response, which allows for the separate evaluation of different criteria). In a holistic assessment, certain criteria may be considered together on one descriptive scale, which renders a final assessment that allows for broader judgments on the quality of particular writing products. As a result, a holistic assessment is usually not quite as rigid as an analytic assessment. This study examined a non-traditional writing program that was highly traditional in its emphasis on stressing the rules of writing mechanics (an analytic method). It specifically focused on instructor familiarity with the program?s required citation format. My research questions: how well would instructors score if given the task of finding deliberately inserted errors? What is instructor perception of format in writing evaluation? And, what, if any, influence does instructor training and experience have on the ability to apply citation format? In addition to being asked to detect 33 deliberately inserted errors in documentation format in a typical student paper, ten instructors at the program, an adult accelerated degree completion program, were also asked to complete a demographic survey. As predicted, except for two notable exceptions, average instructor scores were low (68%). In the follow-up survey, most indicated that they were satisfied with the program?s required APA citation format, and finally, neither length of experience nor discipline-specific training proved to be significant factors in the average of the instructors? scores. As part of the project, the program?s director and the two highest scorers (an English instructor and an accounting instructor) were interviewed to gain insight into how writing requirements fit into the program?s overall curriculum. The director of the program felt that stressing the importance of documentation format helped provide the students in the program with a solid academic grounding. And, despite my intuitive notion that the English instructor would provide the most insightful views on how to promote better student writing, it was the accounting instructor who provided the most helpful feedback (which included a recommendation for the use of other documentation styles in the program). It is hoped that this study offers implications for more in-depth study of instructor response to actual student writing, and more study of other non-traditional writing programs.</field><field name="date">2003-01-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01242003-141932/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The North Carolina Charter School Choice: Selection Factors and Parental Decision Making</field><field name="creator">Fedewa, Michael Joseph</field><field name="description">The study discussed in this dissertation identified and examined the factors that influence a parent's decision to choose a North Carolina charter school for their children. The study was conducted at 13 North Carolina Charter schools. Questionnaires were distributed to 2,325 parents, and 903 were completed. The questionnaire contained 14 questions that examined 16 factors that might influence parental decision-making. Frequency distributions were tabulated for each of the fourteen survey questions. A principal component and a varimax analysis was conducted. The factors were grouped into three categories: (1) administration, (2) academic/instructional, and (3)student-centered. Folowing this procedure, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was applied to the data. This tested the three categories against the independent variables of race, parental income, and parent education level. A post hoc test (Tukey's Studentized Range, HSD) was applied when appropriate. The category administration accounted for the greatest variance in the study. Factors in this category included sports program, extracurricular activities, technology program, facilities, transportation, and food service. The category that accounted for the next largest portion of the variance in the study was academic/instructional factors. These factors included curriculum, people running the school, opportunities for parents to participate, the school's expectation of parents, and academic standards. The category that accounted for the third largest protion of the variance in the model was student-centered factors. These factors included school size, class size, and individual attention provided by teachers. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) tested the three categories against independent variables of race, parental income level, and education levels of parents. Post hoc testing was conducted when there was a significant main effect. This process led to the conclusion that minority parents place more value on administrative selection factors than majority parents. Futhermore, minority parents tend to place more value on academic/instructional selection factors than majority parents. Finally, parents that had professional or post graduate levels of education value administrative selection factors more than parents with lower levels of education.</field><field name="date">2005-01-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Administration and Supervision</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01252005-143207/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Evapotranspiration-based and Soil-Moisture-based Irrigation Control in Turf</field><field name="creator">Vasanth, Arjun</field><field name="description">Turfgrass is a major part of the landscape in North Carolina with its acreage equal to 44% of the state&#226;s harvested crop acreage. Proper irrigation of residential, industrial and commercial turf areas is required to ensure healthy and acceptable turf quality. With increasing competition for water resources and better turf quality, an efficient irrigation control technology is essential in meeting the dual goals of water conservation and turf quality. The objective of the research was to compare two general types of commercially available irrigation control technologies; one based on estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and the other based on feedback from soil moisture sensors. Water application and turf quality resulting from using these technologies were compared to results from using a standard time-based irrigation schedule. The study also incorporated the effect of irrigation frequency. The experimental area, located at North Carolina State University Lake Wheeler Turf Field Laboratories, Raleigh, North Carolina, consisted of forty 4-m x 4-m plots established to &#226;Confederate&#226; tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb) using sod. There were ten treatments combining control type and watering frequency (3 technologies x 3 frequencies + 1 on-demand technology) with four replicates in a randomized complete block design. Technologies included three systems: a time-based system, a soil-moisture-based &#226;add-on&#226; system, an ET-based system each with three frequencies: once per week, twice per week and seven days per week irrigation, and a soil-moisture-based &#226;water on-demand&#226; system which was allowed to schedule irrigation everyday. Rain sensors were connected to the timer-based and ET-based systems to prevent irrigation in case of rainfall. The add-on soil-moisture-based system applied the least amount of water while the ET-based technology applied the most water averaged across frequencies. Once a week irrigation frequency applied the least amount of water, and daily irrigation frequency applied the most when averaged across all technologies. Minimally acceptable turf quality was met by all the treatments when averaged over the duration of the study period, although during the last month of the study some technologies, especially the timer-based and add-on systems had noticeably drought stressed plots. In general, the ET-based system and the water on-demand system had the best turf quality. The water on-demand system resulted in the best combination of water use efficiency and turf quality. Canopy temperatures were measured once a week and there were significant differences in canopy temperature among treatments averaged over the season. The ET system plots had the lowest canopy temperature while the add-on system plots had the highest canopy temperature. Also there was no significant difference between mean weekly reference ET estimates from an atmometer and Penman-Montieth reference ET estimates using a weather station at the site.</field><field name="date">2008-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01252008-171457/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Formula for N-Row Macdonald Polynomials</field><field name="creator">Williams, Ellison Anne</field><field name="description">We derive a formula for the n-row Macdonald polynomials with the coefficients presented both combinatorically and in terms of very-well-poised hypergeometric series.</field><field name="date">2004-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01272004-104704/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstruction of Ground Penetrating Radar Images using techniques based on Optimization.</field><field name="creator">Suvarna, Sushil Sheena</field><field name="description">Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an instrument used in semi-automated construction systems. In principal, images of subsurface objects such as pipes and mines may be detected and potentially measured. The detection of utilities is complicated by a combination of the complexity involved in the data collection technique of the GPR and the irregularities present beneath the surface. This thesis provides the initial results in the development of an algorithm to invert the effects of these corruptions and return images, which are exact in the placement and conformation of subterranean objects. The technique employed is a deconvolution-like method that utilizes a maximum a posteriori (MAP) based optimization method to estimate the best reconstruction. Mean field annealing (MFA) using gradient descent is the optimization method used. Using this technique, single objects in the field of observation were reconstructed to within an acceptable percentage of their original shape. Further work would involve reconstructing multiple objects in the field of observation as well as considering features other than hyperbolae that correspond to objects.</field><field name="date">2004-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01282004-143415/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Argument Generation for a Biomedical Domain</field><field name="creator">Navoraphan, Kanyamas</field><field name="description">Discourse generation is a critical task of natural language generation. In this thesis, we introduce an approach to discourse generation for qualitative causal probabilistic domains that incorporates argumentation into the generation process. The discourse generation process uses three modules: a qualitative causal probabilistic domain model, a genre-specific discourse grammar, and a normative argument generator. The model of discourse generation has been implemented for the domain of clinical genetics. In conjunction with GenIE, a prototype intelligent system for generating the first draft of a patient letter on behalf of a genetic counselor, the discourse grammar exploits general information about clinical genetics as well as documentation about a specific patient's case provided by a genetic counselor, to create discourse plans. The argument generator generates arguments for the claims passed to it from the discourse grammar using domain-independent argument strategies. An important contribution of the thesis is a modification of the argument generator to support interactive argument exploration.</field><field name="date">2008-01-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01282008-150847/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of fire frequency and fire intensity on AM fungal spore abundance, species variety and percent root colonization at Schenck Forest and James Goodwin Forest</field><field name="creator">Rabe Ranjanivo, Mialy-Tiana</field><field name="description">Two greenhouse studies were undertaken: (1) To assess the effects of prescribed fire frequency on AM spore abundance, species variety, and AM percent root colonization of Sudan grass Sorghum sudanese L., between an annually burned site, and a seven-year burned site on a loblolly pine, Pinus taeda L. stand, at Schenck Forest, Wake County, NC., (2) To determine the effects of two levels of fire intensity of pile burning (343oC- 371oC and &gt;470oC), at two depths (0-2cm and 3-6cm), by year and season, on AM fungal spore abundance, AM species variety, and AM percent root colonization of Sudan grass Sorghum sudanese L. at James Goodwin Forest, Moore County, NC. All soil samples were air-dried at room temperature (23oC), stored at 4oC prior to use as inoculum in a greenhouse trap culture. At Schenck Forest, repeated fire was found to impact AM spore abundance though less affecting the species variety. The seven-year burned site had higher number of spores overall. The percent root colonization study revealed non-significant effects of repeated fire between the annually burned and the seven-year burned sites. The percent AM fungal root colonization in spring was always significantly higher than in summer at the annually burned site, but always higher in summer than in spring at the seven-year burned site. Summer had significantly more spores than spring. At James Goodwin Forest, fire disturbance coupled with mild soil surface erosion induced a highly significant difference in AM percent colonization between the control and the disturbed sites pre-burn and burn. Fire disturbance significantly affected AM root colonization by depth compared with unburned. The response of AM root colonization to disturbance is very significantly site specific. The effect of fire intensity is significantly affected by vertical distribution of the propagules. Species variety at both Schenk Forest and James Goodwin Forest non-significantly decreased, propagules survived from high intensity fire but spore numbers were significantly reduced.</field><field name="date">2003-02-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01302003-112253/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of Gonolobus and the Gonolobinae (Apocynaceae, Asclepiadoideae): Circumscription based on evidence from molecules and morphology; new species and new combinations; typification, revision, and conservation in the West Indies.</field><field name="creator">Krings, Alexander</field><field name="description">Gonolobus Michx. (Apocynaceae: Asclepiadoideae) is a New World genus comprising an estimated 100?150 species. The degree of variation in estimated species numbers is largely the result of still poorly known tropical taxa and differences regarding generic limits. Characters historically used to delimit genera such as Gonolobus within Gonolobinae?such as laminar dorsal anther appendages and various follicle morphologies?have been controversial and their evolution remains unknown, not having been explored in a phylogenetic framework. The primary objectives of the current research were to (1) test the monophyly of Gonolobus in the context of a phylogeny of New World Asclepiadeae and (2) explore the evolution of laminar dorsal anther appendages and winged follicles with respect to their potential utility in generic circumscription. Secondary objectives were to revise a tractable monophyletic group as borne out by the phylogenetic analyses and to provide typifications and new combinations as appropriate for Gonolobinae in the West Indies (ca. 50 spp.). Evidence from the chloroplast (trnL-F, rps16) and nuclear genomes (Leafy) presented here supports the monophyly of both the subtribe and the genus Gonolobus in a narrow or broad sense. A transversion in the trnL-F spacer is shown synapomorphic for Gonolobus s.s. Two indels in Leafy, as well as winged follicles, are shown synapomorphic for Gonolobus s.l. Several earlier subgeneric circumscriptions in Matelea, including Ibatia, Heliostemma, Pachystelma, and Ptycanthera, are not monophyletic. Considering the support for a monophyletic Gonolobus s.s., recent taxonomic changes in West Indian taxa, and that several species have been published from the area since the last comprehensive treatment over a hundred years ago, a revision of the genus in the West Indies seemed appropriate and is provided. An index of names and typifications for Gonolobinae in the West Indies is also provided, including numerous lecto- and neotypifications. Twelve new species are described for the West Indies (5 Gonolobus spp., 5 Matelea spp.) and South America (2 Matelea spp.).</field><field name="date">2007-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-01312007-103752/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inventory and Assessment of the Reptile and Amphibian Community of Bull Neck Swamp, Washington County, North Carolina.</field><field name="creator">Hutchens, Stan Jonathan</field><field name="description">Recent declines in reptile and amphibian populations across the globe have encouraged an increased desire to discover, document, and monitor these taxa. Arguably, the greatest cause is land-use change. Management interests for Bull Neck Swamp (BNS) encouraged research to inventory the reptile and amphibian community and to document possible impacts of land-use practices, such as silviculture and site preparation. Four habitat preserves were delineated based on plant community, leaving 1, 554ha (3, 841ac) available for management. Comparisons between habitat assemblages were used to determine if preserves were occupied by more vulnerable species and land-use effects on these species. However, variations in behavioral or environmental variables, and detection probabilities between capture techniques could provide misleading data for assemblage comparisons of community parameters. Therefore, 11 different capture techniques were employed to obtain better samples of habitat assemblages. To determine the accuracy of sampling techniques at inventorying species, techniques were categorized into primary (i.e., drift fence arrays with pitfall and funnel traps, visual encounter surveys, and coverboard arrays), secondary (i.e., road searches, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping grids, auditory surveys, and line transects), and tertiary (opportunistic encounters, aquatic funnel traps, crayfish traps, and basking traps) methodologies. All techniques had variable distributions and were evenly represented in all five areas when possible. All captured individuals were marked; snakes were double-marked with visible implant fluorescent elastomer to augment a concomitant laboratory experiment. Initial capture data were used to derive estimates of species richness (S) and modified Chao - Jaccard similarity indices (JSI). During May to August, 2005 and 2006, 1, 581 total captures represented 33 species, giving an estimated species richness of 34. Primary techniques sampled an estimated species richness of 14 and two unique species, species detected by only one sampling technique. Estimated species richness for secondary and tertiary techniques was 29 and 25, with three and seven unique species, respectively. If primary techniques alone were used, 59% of the reptile and amphibian community, including 10 unique species, would have been missed. Observed and estimated species richness for habitats ranged from 7 to 32 and 13 to 44, respectively. Chao &#226; Jaccard similarity indices ranged from 0.59 to 1.0, with nine comparisons over 0.75, which indicated high similarity between habitat assemblages. These results suggested that land-use practices should be carefully planned and implemented to reduce effects to the reptile and amphibian community of BNS. Empirical results supported the use of elastomers for snakes. It is recommended that future inventory studies for all taxa employ as many capture techniques as logistically and spatially possible to derive accurate species richness. Also, assemblage comparisons should rely on species composition when determining conservation plans.</field><field name="date">2008-02-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02012008-151409/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening tobacco germplasm for resistance to diseases affecting transplant production</field><field name="creator">Elliott, Patsy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Rhizoctonia solani causes stem rot and target spot of greenhouse-produced tobacco seedlings. No fungicides are registered for control of these diseases, so sanitation is the primary disease management strategy. Seedling resistance to R. solani has not been characterized in current tobacco germplasm. The objective of this study was to screen seedlings of a diverse array of accessions, including several classes of tobacco cultivars and related Nicotiana species for resistance to a stem rot (AG-4) and a target spot isolate (AG-3) of R. solani. Further studies were conducted to determine if the resistance identified is heritable. Experiments were conducted in environmentally controlled growth chambers at the NCSU phytotron. Tobacco seedlings were grown in polystyrene trays floating on a nutrient solution to replicate greenhouse growth conditions. Approximately two weeks after germination, rice grains colonized by R. solani were placed on the surface of the growth medium to infest the medium. Symptoms, including death, stem lesions, and target spot lesions, were observed for 42 days after infesting the soil for stem rot and 56 days for target spot. Data were analyzed using a GLM procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Significant differences were observed among the accessions in level of resistance to stem rot and target spot. Disease incidence ranged from 12.5 to 100% for stem rot and 6.2 to 97.9% for target spot. This wide range of disease incidence observed among accessions for both diseases indicates that useful levels of resistance may exist to both diseases and may be useful in future breeding efforts.</field><field name="date">2004-02-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02032004-092716/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Construct Validity of Perceived Cultural Tightness and Culture Strength</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Michael Carter</field><field name="description">Cross-cultural values measurement is a maturing subdiscipline with increasing applicability to the international business environment. However, the utility of cultural values measurement in societies could be enhanced by refining the conceptualization and measurement of relevant cultural features. Measuring values in large, populous, heterogeneous societies may be subject to considerable imprecision. This study conceptually and operationally defined two constructs to enrich cross-cultural values applications: cultural tightness and societal culture strength. This study investigated the construct validity of cultural tightness at multiple levels of analysis. Some evidence supported the distinction of cultural tightness from existing and related constructs. A measure of cultural tightness was not found to relate to societal culture strength but did predict several measures of cultural emergence. I conclude that construct validity is possible despite limited confirmation for hypotheses proposing its construct validity. Likewise, cluster analysis demonstrated only a modest pattern of societal clustering of any of these variables. Recommendations for future research and organizational implications are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009-03-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02032009-094430/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation and Characterization of Electrospun Nonwoven Webs</field><field name="creator">Mohan, Abhay</field><field name="description">It is known that not all polymers can be melted and extruded to form polymer fibers. Electrospinning process involves a direct method to produce fibers in nanometer range by dissolving the polymer in solvent(s) to form the spinning solution. In this work, the spinning solution was prepared by dissolving Poly (ethylene terephthalate) polymer in triflouroacetic acid and methylene chloride. Charging the solution to a very high potential initiated the process to produce electrospun fibers. With increasing voltage, a critical point is reached and a charged jet of the solution is ejected. As this charged jet moves in the air, the solvent evaporates, leaving behind a charged polymer fiber that collects on a targeted source (rotating drum). Equipment to form electrospun fiberwebs on a rotating drum was designed and successfully built. The equipment for this process is relatively simple and small since this process lend itself to the production of fibers/fiberwebs from small quantity of polymer solution. An experiment was designed to investigate the influence of polymer concentration in the spinning solution and the electric field level on fiber and fiberweb response of interest.&lt;br&gt;Electrospun fibers and fiberwebs were characterized for fiber diameter and its distribution, orientation distribution function, and pore size and its distribution. The results showed that an increase in the electric field resulted in a decrease of the average diameter of the electrospun fibers. It has also been observed that there was concentration/electric field interaction effect on fiber diameter. As the electric field increased keeping polymeric concentration constant, the fibers orientation in machine direction increased. It was observed that as the electric field was increased, the average pore diameter decreased. The decrease in average pore size with increase in electric field was explained in terms of fiber diameter as well as fiberweb structural parameters (orientation and basis weight).</field><field name="date">2003-02-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02052003-224020/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legal Requirements Acquisition for the Specification of Legally Compliant Information Systems</field><field name="creator">Breaux, Travis</field><field name="description">U.S. Federal and state regulations impose mandatory and discretionary requirements on industrywide business practices to achieve non-functional, societal goals such as improved accessibility, privacy and safety. The structure and syntax of regulations affects how well software engineers identify and interpret legal requirements.

To support software engineers who must comply with these regulations, I propose a Frame-Based Requirements Analysis Method (FBRAM) to acquire and specify legal requirements from U.S. federal regulatory documents. The legal requirements are systematically specified using a reusable, domain-independent upper ontology, natural language phrase heuristics, a regulatory document model and a frame-based markup language. The methodology maintains traceability from regulatory statements and phrases to formal properties in a frame-based model and supports the resolution of multiple types of legal ambiguity. The methodology is supported by a software prototype to assist engineers with applying the model and with analyzing legal requirements.

An important element that can serve to either enable or hinder employee creativity is employees? perceptions of how conducive their work environment is to being creative, or what has been termed the organization?s climate for creativity (Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, &amp; Herron, 1996). Because organization members? perceptions of the work environment serve as the basis for the climate for creativity, perceptual differences can have important implications for organizations that are striving to enable employee creativity. Recent research by Kwa&#347;niewska and N&#281;cka (2004) found that employee perceptions of climate for creativity, as measured by the Barriers for Creativity in the Workplace Questionnaire (BCWQ), were significantly affected by managerial status. However, the BCWQ was never confirmed to display measurement equivalence, and therefore the authors? findings may not be interpretable as the group differences could be the result of measurement artifacts (Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992; Reise, Widaman, &amp; Pugh, 1993; Vandenberg, 2002). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the climate for creativity, as measured by the KEYS&#174;: Assessing the Climate for Creativity Scale (Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, &amp; Herron, 1996), displayed measurement equivalence across three distinct managerial levels including supervisors (N = 2,100), middle managers (N = 15,829), and executives (N = 2, 960). Both confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and the differential functioning of items and tests (DFIT; Raju, van der Linden, &amp; Fleer, 1995), which is based on item response theory (IRT), were used to assess measurement equivalence in this study. Using the eight factor structure proposed by Rosenberg and Craig (2006), both the CFA and IRT analyses found that the KEYS scale displayed measurement equivalence across all managerial levels. Specifically, the CFA analyses found that the full 78 item KEYS scale displayed configural, metric, and scalar equivalence across all comparison groups. Additionally, two DFIT indices were used to determine that there was no differential functioning found at either the item (NCDIF) or the test (DTF) level when using the full KEYS scale.

Essentially, these theories posit that these forms of structural disadvantage weaken the ability of local residents to achieve mutual goals and solve neighborhood problems, thereby resulting in high crime rates. Several studies have examined the utility of the social disorganization tradition for understanding macro-level variation in crime rates, particularly across neighborhoods. I review this research and propose three ways in which the literature can be extended. First, it is necessary to consider more critically the correspondence between the theoretical and empirical definition of what constitutes a neighborhood rather than relying on the convenience of data for empirical definitions. Second, empirical research should account for the fact that local neighborhoods are not immune to the structural conditions of surrounding areas. Finally, researchers should be more cognizant of whether the effects of neighborhood characteristics influence violent and property crimes similarly. Using data from seventy-four neighborhoods bounded by cultural and historical lines in St. Louis, my analyses speak to each of these issues indicating that both violent and property crime rates are predicted by population turnover and structural disadvantage. Thus, this analysis demonstrated no need for crime-specific models of social disorganization.</field><field name="date">2008-02-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02082008-213439/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antiandrogens and Development of the Male Rat Reproductive Tract</field><field name="creator">Barlow, Norman James</field><field name="description">Di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP) is an antiandrogen with known human exposure. The objectives of this thesis were to investigate the development of male reproductive tract malformations secondary to in utero DBP exposure from the fetus to the adult, to characterize the effects of DBP on fetal testicular gene expression for the steroidogenic enzymes, and to further explore DBP?s potential for inducing Leydig cell adenomas following gestational exposure. In utero DBP exposure led to a characteristic set of fetal testicular lesions including large aggregates of fetal Leydig cells, multinucleated gonocytes, and increased numbers of gonocytes. In addition to the testicular effects, DBP also caused maldevelopment of the epididymides. During the early postnatal period the fetal testicular lesions became less apparent while decreased numbers of spermatocytes were observed. Underdeveloped epididymides noted in fetuses remained small or failed to fully develop resulting in epididymides with missing components. Malformed epididymides were fully manifest in the adult with absent portions observed both unilaterally and bilaterally. Testicular atrophy with loss of spermatocytes became more severe as gestationally exposed animals matured. Gene expression for the steroidogenic enzymes was examined in testes exposed to DBP in utero. Gene expression was decreased for P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme, 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and P450c17; while mRNA expression for 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the final step in testosterone biosynthesis, was not altered. In utero exposure to DBP failed to induce an increased incidence of classical Leydig cell adenomas. However, a dysgenetic lesion composed of numerous poorly differentiated Leydig cells surrounding immature seminiferous tubules was identified.

A modified curriculum from the Lifestyle Balance: Healthy Eating and Being Active Diabetes Prevention program was used. Significant decreases were found in fasting blood sugar over the eight-week period for both program participants and the comparison group. However, there was not an increase in diabetes knowledge, daily moderate-vigorous exercise levels or self-efficacy for physical activity for individuals who participated in the program from Time 1 to Time 2.

This scheme is coupled to a dislocation-density crystalline plasticity formulation and specialized finite-element scheme at different physical scales. The DDGBI scheme is based on slip-system compatibility, local resolved shear stresses, and immobile and mobile dislocation-density activities at GBs. A conservation law for dislocation-densities is used to balance dislocation-density absorption, transmission and emission in GB regions. It is shown that dislocation-density absorptions and pile-ups will increase immobile dislocation-densities in high angle CSL boundaries, such as &#206;&#163;17b. Lower angle CSLs, such as &#206;&#163;1, are characterized by high transmission rates and insignificant GB dislocation-density accumulations. The identification of how different material mechanisms dominate underscores that GB activities, such as dislocation-density absorption, transmission and emission are interrelated interactions. These GB processes can be potentially controlled for desired material behavior. This methodology, together with grain boundary sliding (GBS) scheme and a misorientation dependence on initial GB dislocation-densities, was extended to account for grain size effects on strength. The behavior of polycrystalline aggregates with random low angle and random high angle GBs was also investigated with different crack lengths. For aggregates with random low angle GBs, dislocation-density transmission dominates at the GBs, which indicates that the low angle GB will not significantly change crack growth orientations. For aggregates with random high angle GBs, extensive dislocation-density absorption and pile-ups occur. The high stresses along the GB regions can result in intergranular crack growth due to potential crack nucleation sites in the GB. It is also shown that GB sliding affects crack behavior by attenuating normal stresses and dislocation-density accumulation at critical GB interfaces.</field><field name="date">2009-02-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02132009-173832/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nilpotent N-Lie Algebras</field><field name="creator">Williams, Michael Peretzian</field><field name="description">In 1986, Kasymov introduced the concept of nilpotent $n$-Lie algebras, proved an analogue of Engel's Theorem and later proved an analog of Jacobson's refinement of Engel's Theorem.

Unfortunately, the radiation dose imparted during a CT scan can be significant. This thesis seeks to develop, verify, and validate appropriate computational methods for computing this dose accurately and efficiently. The components of the model are the nuclear data, transport methods, and computer codes. Monte Carlo transport methods are employed primarily for their ability to accurately capture most of the relevant physical phenomena. Deterministic transport methods are subsequently verified and validated. The work is divided into three stages: experimental, verification, and validation. The experimental stage involves gathering high-fidelity data to aid in the validation procedures. Multiple radiation detection devices are employed to give greater certainty to the results. In addition, an important task is gathering data using a geometrically simplified phantom which is easier to model than the detailed Rando phantom. Towards this end, a CTDI FDA phantom is imaged. Exposure and dose measurements were taken in air and in the phantom center and periphery. The second stage, verification, involves the testing of the deterministic model for correctness of the methodology and the physics data, i.e. cross section library. Primarily, there are a few key assumptions which must be tested. The first is the importance of the secondary electron transport. Using Monte Carlo methods, it is found that the transport is unimportant for the accurate computation of the dose deposition distribution given the relatively low energy photons produced by x-rays tubes employed in CT scan machines. This makes the deterministic transport calculations much simpler. Next, the discretization of space, energy, and angle in the deterministic model is examined to ensure sufficient refinement capable of delivering accurate results. The Monte Carlo method is an excellent complement to deterministic methods, serving as reference as though it were an actual experiment, thus allowing the testing of these issues in a straightforward and highly controlled manner. In each discretization, the deterministic model proved capable, although some flux spectrum results differed by fifteen percent or more, mostly a result of the multigroup cross section set. Finally, after ensuring that the deterministic model was functioning as expected, a comparison was made of the simulations to the experimentally measured data. This was the most difficult of the tasks, in great part because of the lack of precise knowledge of detailed information concerning some of the parameters comprising the experimental setup. However, much effort was placed into conforming the simulations to the experiment as closely as possible. The ratio of exposures in the CTDI FDA phantom periphery-to-center is computed to within experimental uncertainty of about ten percent, while the absolute computed exposures have greater errors. The absolute exposures differed from the measured values by less than 35 percent.</field><field name="date">2009-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02172009-200421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Claudin-19 Expression at the Neuromuscular Junction.</field><field name="creator">Okuwa, Sumie</field><field name="description">Terminal Schwann cells (TSCs) sit close together to form a cap over each neuromuscular junction. It is not known how TSCs interact with each other, but their close physical relationship suggests that they might form cell-cell adhesions. Adherens junctions and tight junctions are well-studied formations of cell-cell adhesions and are typically expressed near each other in the same cells. Previous research has shown that M-cadherin, one of the adherens junction proteins, colocalizes with a TSC marker, suggesting the presence of adherens junctions and tight junctions in TSCs. Additionally, claudin-19, one of the tight junction proteins, is known to be expressed by myelinating Schwann cells, but it is unknown whether claudin-19 is also expressed by TSCs. I therefore hypothesize that claudin-19 is expressed by TSCs and is involved in TSC-TSC interactions. To begin to address this hypothesis, immunolabeling against claudin-19, Schwann cells, and acetylcholine receptors was performed on both cryostat sections and whole-mount of mouse muscles. Claudin-19 expression was found at neuromuscular junctions and was localized to the axon-terminal transition, where myelin ends and TSCs begin. After denervation of the muscle and degeneration of all axons, claudin-19 expression was still present at some neuromuscular junctions. These results show for the first time the expression of claudin-19 in Schwann cells at the rodent neuromuscular junction.</field><field name="date">2009-02-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02182009-233110/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Flow in the Measure of Engagement</field><field name="creator">Sharek, David</field><field name="description">eLearning courses are often perceived by their audiences to not be engaging enough to warrant the time and cognitive resources necessary to complete them. Flow Theory&#226;s assessment of optimal experiences (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990) provides insight into understanding user engagement by analyzing the interactions between user skill and task challenge. By designing courses that help users maintain a state of flow through a balance of user skill and task challenge, eLearning courses may better manage the struggle between frustration and boredom and lead to higher levels of engagement. This study investigates a novel technique for measuring task engagement by capturing user behavior data with little-to-no interference with the task. Results indicate that the measurement tool could potentially be used to extrapolate when cognitive overload occurs by helping to identify where in a task a person may reach a point of disengagement, and where they may choose to remain engaged.

The design is based on a parallel architecture data recovery circuit. It uses multiple clock phases from a multi-phase phase-locked loop (MPLL) operating at low frequency to sample high frequency input data in a time-interleaved manner. This results in the reduction of the speed requirement for the transceiver. The new technique of time-interleaved sampling is realized by placing the analog and digital samplers alternately to sample the input data at a sampling rate of two times the data rate (2x). This hybrid parallel sampling scheme provides the input phase error to the multi-phase PLL and simultaneously recovers and deserializes the input data. The data phase detection generates the loop error signal that is proportional to the input phase error, therefore allowing the PLL to have a proportional loop control. This results in improvement of the loop stability, the output jitter, and the bit error rate over the conventional all-digital 2x oversampling, referred to as the bang-bang type phase detection. In addition, to investigate its operation closely, the model and analysis of the multi-phase PLL based on the discrete-time linear system has been developed. This model takes into account the sampling nature of the loop, which provides greater insight into the system behavior and an understanding of system constraints. The analysis shows that when the PLL loop bandwidth is much smaller than the input frequency, the system response can be approximated by the conventional continuous-time model and thus the number of phase detectors employed can be reduced. The model predicts the stability limit of the multi-phase PLL as a function of input frequency, loop bandwidth, and the number of phase detectors. In addition, the phase noise due to the bang-bang type phase detector in PLL-based clock recovery circuits has been analyzed using this model.</field><field name="date">2003-02-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02202003-151133/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simplified Plant Sample Preparation for use in Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Based Metabolomic Profiling and Targeted Analyte Quantitation</field><field name="creator">Jaeger, Frederick Howard</field><field name="description">A simple, fast, reproducible and less laborious sample preparation protocol was developed for the analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

In 2003, Csaba Schneider published a paper in the Journal of Algebra on finite p-groups. Schneider used Lie algebra calculations to inspire the ideas behind the group structure when group G is generated by two elements. He then extended the group ideas to find the structure of G when generated by more than two elements and stated it woud be interesting to look at these results in Lie algebras. This paper completes the analogous Lie algebra problem.

Controlling erosion is the most effective approach to reducing sediment loads, but construction sites typically have large areas of exposed soil during the active phase of clearing and grading. As a result, sediment traps and basins are required to capture eroded sediment on most of these sites. The purpose of this research was to determine the trapping efficiencies of sediment basins of various designs installed on active construction sites. Five traps and one basin were monitored in the Piedmont of North Carolina, all on highway construction sites except one trap on a private development. Automatic samplers were installed to measure flow and to obtain representative samples during storm events. The basins were surveyed after storms to determine the change in volume after repeated surveys. Trapping efficiency was calculated from the sediment accumulation within the traps or basin and the amount of sediment discharged, the sum of which was the total sediment entering the device. Particle size distribution in the sediment deposits was also determined. Two standard traps with rock outlets were found to have 37% and 46% trapping efficiencies after three storm events. A standard trap with silt fence baffles was found to have 45% and 36% efficiency rates during two time periods. Two additional traps, which had been sized for a 25-year storm event, instead of the standard 10-year event, had retention efficiencies of 96% and 99%. A sediment basin with porous baffles and a skimmer outlet had a retention efficiency of 99.8%. One standard trap had particle size distributions for sand, silt, and clay of 34%, 36%, and 30% while a standard trap with a permanent pool had particle size distributions of 55%, 25%, and 20%. The standard trap with silt fence baffles had a distribution of 36%, 50%, and 14%. The 25-year traps had distributions of 75%, 18%, and 7%; and 55%, 20%, and 25%, respectively. The skimmer basin had a distribution of 62%, 28%, and 10%. The higher proportion of sand in the more efficient devices suggests that the less efficient traps are releasing significant amount of sand-size sediment. Larger basins and surface outlets clearly provide greater sediment trapping on construction sites.</field><field name="date">2007-02-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02212007-211521/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects Of Both Above And Below Ground Biomass On Soil Chemical, Physical And Biological Properties On A Coastal Plain Soil In North Carolina</field><field name="creator">West, Eric</field><field name="description">The literature has shown the possibility to enhance many of the soil properties that improve production with additions of plant biomass to the soil in conjunction with long-term conservation tillage. Since it has been proven that reduced tillage is extremely beneficial to a soil&#226;s health, the key question is if the incorporation of deep rooted cover crops and/or large quantities of above ground biomass over a two-year period would result in extensive improvements on a soil&#226;s natural properties throughout the effective rooting depth, or is this too short of a time period for any beneficial effects to occur to the chemical, physical and biological properties of the soil? While SOC additions to the soil surface through decaying biomass can make measurable improvements to a soil in the humid, tropical southeastern U. S., the dynamics of total carbon (total SOC), total nitrogen (TKN), particulate organic matter (POM), potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), CEC and bulk density (Db) in the 0-5, 5-10, and 10-18 cm depths in a production system that incorporates deep rooted cover crops and/or additions of organic matter from cover crops at rates &gt;6 Mg/ha/yr (3 T/ac) are unknown. The objectives of this research were to determine what effect rye (Scale cereale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), triticale (Triticale hexaploide Lart.), annual white sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis), blue lupine (Lupinus angustifolius), rye/hairy vetch (Scale cereale/Vicia villiosa) and alfalfa/rye (Medicago sativa/Scale cereale) would have on the following parameters: total SOC, POM, TKN, PMN, CEC, and Db after two (2) years of seeding. Significant spatial/temporal interactions and main effects were found in Db, PMN, POM and CEC while significant main effects were found in total C and total N. Significant treatment interactions were found in Db, total C, PMN, POM and CEC. Relative to treatment biomass, significant effects were seen between treatments and treatment*year interaction. Results on Db found spatial variability with depth but not with season and a minimal treatment effect depending on surface texture. Total C and total N decreased with depth but were independent spatially and temporally; however, treatment effect on total C was &lt;5 months. Between Db and total C, the two parameters were inversely correlated. PMN either fluctuated between sampling times or declined with time. Notably, rye and rye/hairy vetch effected PMN in the 0-5 cm depth where other treatments showed no effect. POM declined with time regardless of depth implying a priming effect was occurring; however, rye/hairy vetch appeared to show an early reversal trend. As for CEC, there was no consistent trend. Additionally, CEC exhibited a moderate correlation to POM but not total C. Biomass measurements indicated no treatment consistently exceeded &gt;6 Mg/ha/yr. Rye and rye/hairy vetch more often produced the most biomass and lupine achieved the overall maximum yield. Relationships between biomass and N parameters found a moderate, positive effect from the biomass inputs that appeared to compound with time. Overall, rye and rye/hairy vetch were the best cover crop treatments but two years of biomass inputs were not enough to prevent declines in POM. Conversely, PMN fluxed from applied N, and biomass with low C:N ratios oxidized quickly resulting in less carbon. Total C, total N and Db were not responsive to short term management indicating more effort is needed to define and/or develop a cover crop that will consistently reach the &gt;6 Mg/ha/yr.</field><field name="date">2010-03-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02222010-194850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of an Intelligent Compression Stocking for Reducing Ulcer Healing Time</field><field name="creator">Hegarty, Meghan Sarah</field><field name="description">Venous leg ulcers remain a problem in the United States, costing the health care industry nearly $1 billion annually. A major portion of this spending is incurred as a result of prolonged healing time. Compression therapy is known to promote recovery. This technique may be improved by allowing for dynamic customization of treatment parameters. The design of a sensing system for an intelligent compression stocking is described in this thesis. This sensing system will eventually serve as a means by which to quantify the performance of the stocking through the continuous measurement of key physiological variables. Blood flow velocity will be measured using an acoustic array, and leg volume will be quantified using bio-impedance techniques. Preliminary experiments were conducted in order to verify the responsiveness and practicality of using these technologies to monitor ulcer healing. The Edema Monitoring System was capable of resolving small changes in leg volume resulting from artificially-induced swelling. Unfortunately, the Acoustic Blood Flow Measurement System did not perform acceptably in terms of accuracy and robustness. Future directions for this technology include finding a more acceptable means by which to measure blood flow velocity, improving the sensing system by incorporating additional optimization parameters, exploring the use of alternative actuation mechanisms, and expanding its use to encompass all medical-grade compression stockings.</field><field name="date">2008-03-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02252008-110213/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interest Group Psychological Sense of Community: Measurement and the Monolithic Fallacy</field><field name="creator">Prohn, Seb MacKenzie</field><field name="description">Interest group psychological sense of community (PSOC) is understudied. As a result the extant literature on this phenomenon ranges from incomplete to unfounded. Therefore, the goal of this research is to investigate two assumptions posited by previous research. The first of which is the assumption that the Sense of Community Index (SCI) is measurement tool that best fits interest group PSOC data, and the second is the presumption that disparate interest groups conceptualize the PSOC construct similarly. To test the aforementioned assumptions of interest group PSOC, North American community gardens (N=110) and Australian Rules Football teams (N=107) completed an online survey assessing community perceptions. Through exploratory factor analysis newly designed PSOC items were allowed to freely compete with SCI items to create groups of observable measures best defined by PSOC&#226;s four theoretical factors: membership, mutual influence, needs attainment and shared emotional connection. Confirmatory factor analysis was used showing a better fit of the new PSOC scale (AIC=274.51) than the SCI (AIC=281.51) test fit of model to PSOC data. An independent sample t test showed that community gardeners (M=5.32, SD=.82) experienced a less robust PSOC than USAFL players (M=5.63, SD=.91), t(216)= -2.66, p&lt;.05, r2=.03). Then CFA was used once more to inspect factorial invariance between interest communities and the &#226;generic interest community&#226;. The results showed the change between configural and constrained models were non-significant for garden communities [&#226;[&#207;2(6)=12.50, p&gt;.05] and Australian Rules football communities[&#226;[&#207;2(6)=7.90, p&gt;.05].

In North Carolina, TSWV is vectored primarily by the tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), and the Western flower thrips, F. occidentalis Pergande, both of which can acquire and subsequently transmit TSWV only by feeding on infected foliage as young larvae. Females oviposit in suitable plant tissues; therefore, only those plant species susceptible to systemic infection and with the ability to support reproduction by vector species have the potential to be important sources of virus inoculum. We conducted systematic plant surveys to determine the incidence of TSWV and the relative abundance of thrips vector species on summer annual and perennial plants commonly associated with susceptible crops in North Carolina. Frankliniella occidentalis was the most abundant vector and comprised &gt;75% of vector species collected from 18 wild plant species during the summer and fall of 2002. The number of F. occidentalis and F. fusca larvae collected from plant samples, whose presence indicates a plant?s suitability for reproduction, varied significantly among the species sampled. The plant species yielding the largest collections of immature F. occidentalis were tall morningglory (Ipomoea purpurea), carpetweed (Mollugo verticillata), sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia), and Palmer?s pigweed (Amaranthus palmeri). Plant species most suitable for F. fusca reproduction included Florida pusley (Richardia scabra), M. verticillata, and ivyleaf morningglory (I. hederacea). During surveys of wild plant species in or adjacent to highly TSWV-infected crop fields, TSWV was documented at 16 of 17 locations (94.1%) and in 14 of 30 weed species (46.7%). Estimated rates of infection were highest in I purpurea (6.8%) and I. hederacea (1.9%). Mollugo verticillata returned an unusually high proportion of marginally TSWV-positive samples and conservative estimates of infection rate were 0.5%. However, the actual importance of this species as a TSWV reservoir may be much greater, as liberal estimates (assuming marginal samples were indeed TSWV-infected) indicate an infection rate of 5.4%. These findings document that only a limited number of summer annual or perennial weed species are potentially important TSWV reservoirs or support high levels of vector reproduction in North Carolina. The temporal characteristics of vector abundance and dispersal were documented in the summer and fall of 2002 using aerial sticky traps surrounding 9 agricultural fields. Of vector species captured, 83.3% were F. occidentalis, 11.9% were F. fusca, and the remaining 4.8% were Thrips tabaci Lindeman. The timing of F. occidentalis dispersal, as indicated by mean cumulative proportions of F. occidentalis caught on traps, varied significantly among locations. Patterns of fall dispersal were unrelated to senescence of summer annual weeds, cultivation practices, or the first freeze date. Temporal patterns of TSWV movement were monitored with sentinel tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum var. ?mountain fresh?) at the same locations where aerial sticky traps occurred. TSWV-infected sentinel plants were recovered, sporadically and unpredictably, over a 3-month span in the fall of 2002. TSWV movement was not related to thrips dispersal, cultivation date, or summer weed maturation.</field><field name="date">2004-03-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02272004-101929/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple Fires</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Marjorie Schratz</field><field name="description">"Suspended in Mid-Air while Looking under the Bed" begins and loosely foreshadows this collection of poetry and short stories.

The resulting field has a property of refocusing. Time reversal in acoustics has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. In this thesis we consider the problem of time reversal of electromagnetic waves in inhomogeneous layered media. We use Markov process model for the medium parameters which allows us to exploit diffusion approximation theorem. We show that the field generated by the time reversal mirror focuses at a point of initial source inside of the medium. The size of the focusing spot is of the kind that it is smaller than the one that would be obtained if the medium were homogeneous meaning that the super resolution phenomenon is observed.</field><field name="date">2006-03-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02272006-183752/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Active Failure Detection Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Hannas, Benjamin L</field><field name="description">This study analyzes two robust failure detection algorithms and applies the algorithms to three power system models. An optimal test signal to distinguish between a failure model and a normal model is calculated using the two algorithms. Advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm, Direct Optimization (DO) and Constrained Control (CC), are discussed. DO uses complex software (Sparse Optimal Control Software by The Boeing Corporation) to solve the necessary and boundary conditions of the optimization problem directly. CC utilizes free software (SciLab by Inria, Enpc.) to solve a two-point boundary value problem based on the necessary and boundary conditions of the optimization problem. Both algorithms yield similar signals, but DO is faster and more accurate yet requires expensive software. CC is not as robust, but can be run on free software and does not need as much fine tuning as the DO algorithm.

Electrochemical processing, also known as pyroprocessing, represents a non-aqueous method of reprocessing that uses high temperature molten-salt based electrochemical technology. This method provides several advantages over conventional aqueous processing with respect to proliferation resistance. With electrochemical processing there is no pure plutonium separation and the presence of large decay heat and high radiation barriers dissuades diversion attempts. As the current electrochemical processing relies on a batch operation, the total throughput of the system is inherently limited and nuclear materials accounting is difficult due to the nonhomogeneous nature of the process. This results in much larger uncertainties in the total amount of material processed compared to the aqueous UREX+ or PUREX processes. Continuous electrochemical processing was considered as a way to address these concerns. The objective of this research was to investigate the feasibility of a continuous electrochemical processing operation to achieve the desired separation performance by using computer based simulation. The conceptual design of the continuous electrochemical processing includes two separate stages in a molten salt medium. First, a pure uranium deposit is collected at a solid cathode during the uranium extraction stage. When the amount of plutonium in electrorefiner becomes comparable or higher than the amount of uranium in the electrorefiner, a liquid cathode is employed to extract both uranium and plutonium in the second stage. In this approach, molten salt, as the material carrier, flows through the electrorefiner while chopped spent fuel is continuously fed into the system. Simulations of electrochemical reactions at the electrode surfaces were based on the kinetic modeling capability of a time-dependent code, REFIN. Based on a screening study performed for the most significant process parameters over a broad range of values, a functional combination of initial uranium and plutonium concentrations at the anode and in the molten salt was determined for continuous operation. This dictated the use of a higher concentration of uranium than plutonium at the anode and a lower concentration of uranium than plutonium in the molten salt. Furthermore, using design of experiment technique for computers, a refinement of initial concentrations was performed to maximize the total throughput and minimize the operational time. The flow velocity profiles and chemical concentration distributions of elements in molten salt have been determined through three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations using ANSYS CFX. This approach resulted in the need to evaluate the diffusion layer thickness at the cathode &#226; molten salt interface, an important parameter for the electrochemical process. Computer based simulations of the continuous electrochemical processing concept presented in this study have provided an indication that electrochemical processing could be a viable technology for closing the nuclear fuel cycle.</field><field name="date">2009-03-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02272009-172349/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vehicle Control in Full Unsteady Flow Using Surface Measurements</field><field name="creator">Levedahl, Blaine Alexander</field><field name="description">This dissertation is the first comprehensive attempt to address a new engineering problem: control of a vehicle maneuvering in a full unsteady flow field. The approach to the solution is focused in three main areas: modeling of a vehicle in full unsteady flow, control of a vehicle in full unsteady flow, and synthesizing the fluid loads for use in control of a vehicle maneuvering in a full unsteady flow field. To model a vehicle maneuvering in a full unsteady flow field this dissertation develops the Coupled Fluid Vehicle (CFV) model in which the fluid, which is a sum of a finite number of spatially dependent velocity fields whose contributions vary with time, is coupled to the vehicle rigid-body equations of motion. To control a vehicle maneuvering in a full unsteady flow field this dissertation develops the Fluid Compensation Control (FCC) strategy which gives the designer an opportunity to include the fluid states, in addition to the vehicle states, in the control law and an opportunity to balance reducing the fluid dynamic load through compensation and reducing the state error through regulation. To synthesize the fluid loads this dissertation has attempted to forward current work on the prediction of fluid loads from stagnation and separation point measurements using the Kutta principle, which says that the velocity around a vehicle is a smoothly varying function and that it is determined up to a multiplicative constant by its nodes (stagnation, separation, and reattachment points/lines), and by conducting an experiment to attempt to determine the correlation of the fluidic loads from the orientation and separation lines on a 3-dimensional bluff body.</field><field name="date">2010-03-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02272010-190048/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioturbation as a novel method to characterize the toxicity of aquatic sediment.</field><field name="creator">Cho, Eun-ah</field><field name="description">Bioturbation, the biological process through which many species of infaunal benthic invertebrates suspend bottom sediments into the water column through their burrowing, feeding, respiratory, and locomotor activities, may be a sub-lethal endpoint that can be exploited to assess the toxicity of aquatic sediments. Therefore, we developed a novel test method that used bioturbation (BioTurbTox test) generated by the activities of second in-star Chironomus tentans larvae as the toxicity endpoint (Chapter 2). To validate this method, copper (Cu) and fluoranthene were individually spiked into relatively uncontaminated aquatic sediment to assess changes in bioturbation and mobilization of the chemicals into the overlying water. Turbidity production responded to the chemicals in the sediment in a concentration-dependent manner and was an excellent indicator of sediment toxicity. Moreover, substantial concentrations of Cu were released into the overlying water from the Cu-spiked sediment, whereas little fluoranthene was mobilized into the overlying water from the fluoranthene-spiked sediment. Sediment samples were then collected from the field and used to evaluate the similarity of response of the BioTurbTox test to other more standardized toxicity tests. In the summer of 2003, sediment samples were collected at six sites in the Neuse River of North Carolina tested for toxicity, and analyzed for chemical contaminants (Chapter 3). Atrazine was the most frequently detected current-use pesticide and pyrene and fluoranthene were measured at relatively high concentrations from the Neuse River sites. Concentrations of fluoranthene were correlated with results from the Ceriodaphnia dubia porewater and BioTurbTox tests. We concluded that the new BioTurbTox test was useful as a rapid screening method for sediment toxicity information, but required normalization to the clay content or to the total organic carbon content of field collected sediments. In Chapter 4, the toxicity of environmental pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were evaluated with the BioTurbTox and C. dubia reproductive tests. Fluoxetine and bisphenol A significantly affected bioturbation caused by C. tentans, especially at high concentrations (1-2 mg/L), and the turbidity change induced by caffeine, fluoxetine, and bisphenol A showed a concentration-response relation. Triclosan affected reproduction of C. dubia at relatively low concentrations (IC50: 85.4 ?&#221;g/L). However, most of the tested PPCPs were not acutely toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations, but were relatively toxic at high concentrations. In Chapter 5, two sediment-spiking methods (extract mixing vs. whole sediment dilution methods) were compared with the BioTurbTox test and a gradient response was observed from both methods. Based on the similarity of the toxic response, we determined that either of the spiking methods was appropriate for estimating the toxicity of aquatic sediments in screening level assessments. The overall conclusion from this research was that the newly developed BioTurbTox test shows promise as a tool to assess the toxicity and mobilization of contaminants from aquatic sediments.</field><field name="date">2005-02-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02282005-111535/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Effect of Employment Type and Performance Type on Performance Ratings</field><field name="creator">Bhavsar, Kartik Satish</field><field name="description">This study examines performance appraisal differences for two types of contingent employees and noncontingent employees in terms of task performance and contextual performance.

In this thesis, I argue that medieval fantasy is more productively framed as myth and folklore, and that what some call ?repetition? would be better named ?iteration.? By functioning via the folkloric process of incremental repetition, various fantastic tale-types adapt to individual novels? purposes in the way that the ancient oral tale once adapted to audience. The advent of the literary fairy tale, which has culminated in the work of Walt Disney, has halted the natural storytelling process and ?frozen? many traditional tales in place. Medieval fantasy actively fights such narrative distillation?which inevitably leads to dogmatic didacticism?by rejecting master narrative and regenerating the active, meaning-making relationship between author and reader. A particular type of fantasy, called ?metafantasy,? makes calling attention to the process of story its primary aim. In so doing, metafantasy fights the tendency to Disneyfication and the appropriation of myth by dominant ideologies. I explicate the folkloric processes of three metafantasy novels here: The Last Unicorn, by Peter Beagle; The Princess Bride, by William Goldman; and Phillip Pullman?s His Dark Materials series.</field><field name="date">2007-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02282007-125257/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substituent Effects on Exchange Coupling: Controlling the Interactions between Unpaired Electrons</field><field name="creator">Coote, Tashni-Ann</field><field name="description">Design, synthesis, and characterization of novel high-spin species are critical for advancing the field of molecular magnetism, and subsequently creating new magnetic materials.

These tests require a referent indicator (RI) for model identification. This RI is assumed to be perfectly invariant across groups. Using simulated data, results indicate that inappropriate RI selection may be mildly problematic for scale-level invariance tests and highly problematic for item-level tests. These findings underscore the importance of careful RI selection.</field><field name="date">2007-03-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02282007-135821/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conservation implications of introduced trout and beaver on native fish in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, Chile</field><field name="creator">Moorman, Michelle</field><field name="description">Introduced species are a threat to native species conservation worldwide and can cause an overall reduction in biodiversity. In the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve in southern Chile, introduced beaver and trout are highly successful invaders in the landscape and alter stream ecosystem function. Our research suggests introduced beaver create favorable feeding habitats for native puye (Galaxias maculatus) by increasing available macrobenthic biomass and creating ideal feeding conditions for puye. A negative effect of trout on puye was only detectable in favorable beaver-altered habitats where puye abundance was significantly reduced. A negative relationship between trout density and aquatic macrobenthic biomass suggests introduced trout reduce prey availability at the patch-scale. Our findings also show the presence of endangered Aplochiton spp. on Navarino and Hoste islands and the absence of brown trout completely from the southeast fringe of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Conservation measures be taken to prevent the spread of brown trout into the area in order to protect rare Aplochitons spp. These results emphasize the need for understanding introduced species distributions and their influence on native biota and stream ecology so conservation measures to preserve native species and the pristine status of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve can be implemented.</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-02282007-215241/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">N-Symplectic Quantization</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jonathan D.</field><field name="description">A quantization scheme based on n-symplectic geometry is defined.

Among these traded credit derivatives, a growing interest has been shown on multi-name credit derivatives, whose underlying assets are a pool of defaultable securities. For a multi-name credit derivative, the key is the default dependency structure among the underlying portfolio of reference entities, instead of the individual term structure of default probabilities for each single reference entity as in the case of single-name derivative. So far, however, default dependency modeling is still the most demanding open problem in the pricing of credit derivatives. The research in this dissertation is trying to model the default dependency with aid of perturbation method, which was first proposed by Fouque, Papanicolaou and Sircar (2000) as a powerful tool to pricing options under stochastic volatility. Specifically, after a theoretic result regarding the approximation accuracy of the perturbation method and an application of this method to pricing American options under stochastic volatility by Monte Carlo approach, a multi-dimensional Merton model under stochastic volatility is studied first, and then the multi-dimensional generalization of the first-passage model under stochastic volatility comes next, which is then followed by a copula perturbed from the standard Gaussian copula.</field><field name="date">2006-03-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03022006-170911/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' and Teachers' Conceptions of Surface Area to Volume in Science Contexts: What Factors Influence the Understanding of the Concept of Scale?</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Amy Rebecca</field><field name="description">The National Science Education Standards emphasize teaching unifying concepts and processes such as basic functions of living organisms, the living environment, and scale (NRC, 1996). Since the relationship of surface area to volume is a pervasive concept that can be found throughout different sciences, it is important for students to not only understand the association of the two, but to also be able to apply it to various situations. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that influence the understanding of the concept of scale involving surface area to volume relationships. The first study reported here describes a pilot study with middle school participants in which the correlation between proportional reasoning ability and a student&#226;s ability to understand surface area to volume relationships was explored. The results of this study showed there was a statistically significant correlation between proportional reasoning scores and the surface area to volume posttest scores. This correlation was explored further in the second study in which middle school students&#226;, high school students&#226;, and science teachers&#226; abilities in proportional reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and understanding surface area to volume relationships were assessed. Regression results indicated that all participants&#226; proportional reasoning and visual-spatial scores could be a possible predictor for one&#226;s ability to understand surface area to volume relationships.

The integral method is employed as the scheme for the analysis of the gas boundary layer. By incorporating empirical correlations and profiles for temperature, velocity, and density, the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved for boundary layer thickness and maximum velocity. Eventually, the desired physical characteristics of heat flux and condensation rate are determined. The major constraint enforced in the model is that the water within the boundary layer is either saturated vapor or slightly superheated. Local condensation away from the wall is not considered. A diverse range of mixtures were studied to examine the effects of noncondensable gas concentration on the heat transfer and condensation rates. It is shown in the results how the presence of air is a hindrance to the diffusion of vapor through the gas boundary layer. The results are compared to a previous empirical model. The results showed reasonable agreement with the previous experimental study discussed. For very large and often times more applicable temperature differences, the model predicts volumetric condensation within the gas boundary layer. A semi-empirical one-equation turbulence model was introduced, and although the turbulent impact on effective properties was determined to be small, it was included nonetheless for flexibility. Code logic and methodology are presented to automate this problem, as the solution is obtained through the iteration on both the turbulent viscosity and the interface temperature.</field><field name="date">2010-03-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03022010-171030/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">System Level Airworthiness Tool: A Comprehensive Approach to Small Unmanned Aircraft System Airworthiness.</field><field name="creator">Burke, David Alexander</field><field name="description">One of the pillars of aviation safety is assuring sound engineering practices through airworthiness certification. As Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) grow in popularity, the need for airworthiness standards and verification methods tailored for UAS becomes critical. While airworthiness practices for large UAS may be similar to manned aircraft, it is clear that small UAS require a paradigm shift from the airworthiness practices of manned aircraft. Although small in comparison to manned aircraft these aircraft are not merely remote controlled toys. Small UAS may be complex aircraft flying in the National Airspace System (NAS) over populated areas for extended durations and beyond line of sight of the operators. A comprehensive systems engineering framework for certifying small UAS at the system level is needed. This work presents a point based tool that evaluates small UAS by rewarding good engineering practices in design, analysis, and testing.

In this thesis, the isomorphism classes of commuting pairs of involutions of $SL(n,k)$ for arbitrary fields of characteristic not two are determined. This is done in three main parts: commuting pairs of inner involutions, commuting pairs of involutions with one inner involution and one outer involution, and commuting pairs of outer involutions. The classification is done up to (almost) inner automorphism of $SL(n,k)$ as in the case of a single involution, completed in cite{Involutions_HWD}. For commuting pairs of involutions, the classification is done in several pieces, each of which uses an isomorphism class representative of a single involution of $SL(n,k)$ as the first entry. First, it is shown that if a mapping of a certain form is invertible, it will partially zero-out the matrix representative of one of the entries in the pair of commuting involutions while fixing the other pair, and will be an inner automorphism of $SL(n,k)$. Then, it is shown that, indeed, the given mapping must be invertible for one of a few given forms. This leads to an induction argument that gives a partial classification of the commuting inner pairs. To finish the classification, whether or not the remaining pairs are isomorphic is determined. Next, using results on Quadratic forms, a 'nice' form for commuting pairs with one inner and one outer involution is found. To finish the classification of such pairs, work is completed on a field (of characteristic not two) by field basis and results are explicitly obtained for algebraically closed fields, the real numbers, finite fields, and the $p$-adic numbers. Lastly, equivalence between the classification of commuting outer pairs and commuting pairs with one inner involution and one outer involution is shown.</field><field name="date">2010-03-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03042010-150145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Portrayal of Organizational Culture in Internet Recruitment: Can Applicants Gain a Sense of Person-Organization Fit through a Recruitment Website?</field><field name="creator">Kroustalis, Christina Marie</field><field name="description">This study found that culture-specific pictures on a recruitment website allowed individuals to more accurately assess an organization?s culture, while employee testimonials had no such effect.

Toxic A. monilatum produces endotoxins with hemolytic and neurotoxic properties, and has been linked to major fish and invertebrate kills. The responses of three ecologically important shellfish species to A. monilatum (toxic strain AMO3) were experimentally assessed. In the first set of experiments, grazing studies were conducted with adult and juvenile eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica Gmelin), northern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria Linnaeus), and green mussels (Perna viridis Linnaeus), which inhabit areas where A. monilatum blooms occur. Clearance rates of each shellfish species were depressed when exposed to toxic A. monilatum (bloom density of ~550 cells ml-1) alone or with nontoxic Instant Algae&#174; Pavlova, in comparison to clearance rates of control animals fed benign cryptophyte algae. There was also a reduction in the clearance rate of adult and juvenile C. virginica and P. viridis, as well as juvenile M. mercenaria exposed to A. monilatum, in comparison to control animals that were exposed to a nontoxic strain of a dinoflagellate of similar size, Alexandrium tamarense (clone CCMP115). Exposure to toxic A. monilatum significantly decreased shellfish valve gape in adult P. viridis and C. virginica. Intact A. monilatum cells were found within shellfish feces, but A. monilatum cells did not divide following passage through the gut. In the second set of experiments, survival of larval M. mercenaria and C. virginica was tested when the larvae were exposed to A. monilatum as intact cells, cells held in dialysis tubing, or sonicated cells. Survival of larvae was significantly less when exposed to sonicated A. monilatum, in comparison to survival of control larvae that were tested with nontoxic A. tamarense. Overall, these data indicate that A. monilatum blooms can adversely affect survival of some shellfish species by reducing clearance rate and valve gape, affecting food intake, and inducing larval mortality.</field><field name="date">2006-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03062006-182116/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth Performance and the Development of Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria in Swine Fed Growth-promoting Antimicrobials</field><field name="creator">Holt, Jonathan Paul</field><field name="description">Three experiments were conducted to study the impact of growth-promoting levels of various antimicrobials on performance and the development of antibiotic-resistant commensal bacteria in swine. In experiment one, feeding subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics, or high levels of zinc and copper did not improve growth performance of nursery pigs housed in a biosecure facility that were farrowed from sows not previously exposed to antibiotics. In experiment two, feeding nursery pigs obtained from a commercial source high levels of zinc resulted in increased ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed a diet containing no antimicrobials or high levels of copper. In experiment three, subtherapeutic levels of chlortetracycline improved ADG, ADFI, and G:F for only the first week after weaning. Performance improvements were not observed for finishing pigs fed subtherapeutic levels of virginiamycin compared to pigs fed no antibiotics. High levels of zinc may be as effective as subtherapeutic antibiotics at improving nursery pig performance. The use of antimicrobial growth-promoters in clean, well-managed facilities with high labor inputs will not improve growth performance of swine. Feeding various antimicrobials were ineffective at reducing the total number of commensal bacteria isolated from pigs in any study. Although pigs in experiment one were farrowed from sows not exposed to antibiotics for over 33 years, commensal bacteria isolated from these pigs exhibited resistance to multiple antibiotics. E. coli resistant to neomycin were isolated only from pigs fed diets containing subtherapeutic antibiotics in experiment one. In experiment two, feeding pigs diets containing growth-promoting levels of antibiotics, zinc, or copper resulted in increased percent of E. coli resistant to tylosin, erythromycin, and copper. Feeding a diet with subtherapeutic levels of tylosin and sulfamethazine also increased the percent of Enterococcus resistant to tylosin, sulfamethazine, and erythromycin compared to pigs fed no antimicrobials or high levels of zinc. While fluctuations in antibiotic resistance were observed between treatments in experiment two, there were no differences between treatments in percent of bacteria resistant to any antibiotics at the conclusion of the trial. In experiment three, percent of E. coli and Enterococcus isolated from pigs that were resistant to chlortetracycline and virginiamycin fluctuated when monitored for a 19 week grow/finish study, however no differences in percent of resistant bacteria were observed between pigs fed diets containing no antibiotics or growth-promoting levels of antibiotics at the conclusion of the trial. In the fourth experiment, manure from pigs receiving growth-promoting antibiotics was spread on soil boxes and subjected to a simulated rainfall event to measure antibiotic resistance in water runoff. A greater amount of antibiotic resistant bacteria were recovered from water runoff at the initial sampling period compared to sampling 30 min after runoff began. Percent of antibiotic resistance isolated from swine can fluctuate over time. Development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria may be increased by the use of antimicrobial growth-promoters, however, resistant bacteria are present in swine facilities regardless of the use of their use. These resistant bacteria can potentially enter the environment through land application of manure. Antibiotic resistance will not be easily reversed by removal of antibiotics from livestock feeds.</field><field name="date">2008-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science and Poultry Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03062008-140835/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Type I molecular markers in a line of pigs selected for increased litter size.</field><field name="creator">Blowe, Charlotte Dawn</field><field name="description">Direct selection for increased litter size was practiced for eleven generations in a Large White-Landrace composite line of pigs.

The objective of this research project was to test associations between Type I markers and response to selection. A candidate gene approach was employed to search for markers, which may explain some of the difference in litter size between the two lines. Two novel markers were discovered within the follistatin gene, which have shown associations with litter traits. The estrogen receptor marker was not segregating in the population of pigs used in this study.

I use global political economic theory, organizational theory, and theories of inequality to investigate how local actors address poverty in their communities. Specifically, I examine through a comparative case study how government and nonprofit service providers in two North Carolina counties cope with challenges that derive from global and national levels as well as local factors to serve the poor. I rely on extensive interviews, observations, and secondary data. I find that officials in the rural county are severely constrained in their ability to address poverty, due to lower organizational capacity and very limited financial and social resources. The implications of poverty policy for rural and urban areas differ. Not only has inequality within place been exacerbated by recent national and global trends, but inequality between places is aggravated as well. Further, most resources in the urban county are used in ways that reinforce dependence on the low-wage labor market. In both counties services are disciplinary in nature, reflecting the neoliberal environment in which service providers operate. Only in some cases&#226;and only in the urban county&#226;do agencies address the market&#226;s inadequacies and general issues of class, race, and gender inequality. In fact, only when there is high organizational capacity, some autonomy, and significant embeddedness in the community, do I find local leaders who are willing to stop regulating the poor as should-be low-wage workers.</field><field name="date">2010-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03082010-143335/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Ethnography of Faculty in a Community College and a Public, Regional, Comprehensive University</field><field name="creator">Burton, Carol</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to seek to understand faculty culture at a community college and at a public, regional, comprehensive university.

The pathogen is a fungus-like organism and is a member of the Oomycota. P. tabacina is an obligate parasite restricted to the genus Nicotiana spp. Identification of the pathogen is difficult since symptoms and signs generally occur 6-12 days post inoculation. The spread of the pathogen occurs through aerial long distance dispersal of inoculum and severe epidemics occur yearly in tobacco growing areas of the world. One objective of this work was to develop a real-time Taq Man assay for the detection and quantification of P. tabacina. Optimization of the assay was established at a final concentration of 450nM of primers and 125nM of probe. The assay was useful for detection of the pathogen down to a lower limit of 1fg of DNA. The pathogen could be detected after 4 days post inoculation. The real-time PCR assay was useful for the specific detection of P. tabacina in field samples, artificially inoculated leaves, roots, and systemically infected tobacco seedlings and could be used as a tool for regulatory agencies interested in the detection of the pathogen. A second objective was to examine the genetic structure of the pathogen in North America, Central America, the Caribbean and Europe and determine the direction of migration of the pathogen. The intergenic spacer Igs2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the Ras-related protein (Ypt1) gene, and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (cox2 gene) were used. Populations of P. tabacina were characterized by high nuclear diversity, low population division and a possible mixed sexual and asexual reproductive system. Large population size, the mechanism of dispersal, mutation rate and genetic diversity indicate that this pathogen is a high evolutionary risk plant pathogen. An isolation with migration (IM) model was used to study genetic diversity in the U.S./Central America and the Caribbean (CCAM) and the European subpopulations. Results support migration from the CCAM region, Florida and Texas into the northern part of the U.S. including North Carolina. These data validate previous migration reports of the pathogen by the North American Plant Disease Forecasting Center at NCSU. In Europe estimates for the migration of the pathogen from North Central to Western Europe and both these regions to Lebanon support migration reports for the first introductions of the pathogen into Europe. Mitochondrial sequences of P tabacina and Hyaloperonspora parasitica genome were generated using bioinforrmatics approaches and PCR methodology. One quarter of the mitochondrial genome of P. tabacina has been annotated and compared with that of Phytophthora infestans and Hyaloperonospora parasitica. Similarities in direction, arrangement and number of genes and regions have been found. Results from this research will be useful in understanding the evolutionary history of the Oomycetes as well as future population genetics research to investigate how these organisms adapt, survive and attack plants in a changing environment.</field><field name="date">2009-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03092009-143022/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal Design of Wide Beam Area X-Ray Sources</field><field name="creator">Bobolea, Nicolae Alin</field><field name="description">Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI) with x-ray radiation provided by a synchrotron source has been shown to provide good image contrast at lower radiation dose for materials with small x-ray attenuation coefficient As a result, DEI has received significant interest for digital mammography and other medical imaging applications. However, deployment of a synchrotron source at a medical facility is not currently feasible due to its size and costs. Consequently, a compact x-ray source capable of delivering x-ray intensities and beam collimation similar to a synchrotron accelerator is desirable. A wide beam area x-ray source has been suggested as a possible alternative to a synchrotron source, with the x-rays generated by electron bombardment of a suitable target material. Previous research work demonstrated a prototype scale cylindrical shaped oxygen free copper target with a layer of molybdenum to be feasible from an engineering perspective. An industrial size DEI facility requires a scale-up of the proof-of-principle design. The x-ray flux necessary for high image quality implies significant heat loading on the x-ray source. Safe operation of a full scale DEI facility is reliant upon a thermal management solution capable of rejecting this heat. An active target cooling system has been proposed and its performance has been evaluated through CFD simulation. The design ensures the maximum target temperature is maintained at reasonable levels and coolant boiling is not reached under the most demanding operating conditions.</field><field name="date">2009-03-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03092009-180052/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Graphic Organizer and Metacognitive Monitoring Instruction on Expository Science Text Comprehension in Fifth Grade Students</field><field name="creator">Hoffmann, Kristin Fisher</field><field name="description">This study sought to examine the impact of teaching both graphic organizer and metacognitive monitoring strategies on the comprehension of 5th grade students reading expository science text. In 2000, the National Reading Panel recommended multi-strategy comprehension instruction; graphic organizers and metacognitive monitoring were two of the recommended strategies. Few studies have examined the impact of combining graphic organizer instruction with metacognitive reading strategy instruction. In this study the effectiveness of teaching both graphic organizer and metacognitive monitoring strategies was compared with instruction in either graphic organizer or metacognitive monitoring strategies. Students in the Graphic Organizer + Metacognitive Monitoring Condition and students in the Metacognitive Monitoring Condition showed increased reading comprehension scores over the course of the six-week intervention on seven expository science passages, whereas students in the Graphic Organizer Condition showed no improvement in passage comprehension scores. In addition, over the course of the intervention, students in the Graphic Organizer + Metacognitive Monitoring Condition showed a significant increase in test scores on a standardized test of reading comprehension. With regard to the increase in reading passage and comprehension test scores, findings from this study revealed that score increases occurred only in conditions where students received metacognitive monitoring strategy instruction. Evidence from this study revealed the importance of metacognitive strategy instruction on reading comprehension gains.</field><field name="date">2010-04-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03092010-135658/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supernova Remnants as a Probe of Dust Grains in the Interstellar Medium</field><field name="creator">Williams, Brian Jeffrey</field><field name="description">Interstellar dust grains play a crucial role in the evolution of the galactic interstellar medium (ISM). Despite its importance, however, dust remains poorly understood in terms of its origin, composition, and abundance throughout the universe. Supernova remnants (SNRs) provide a laboratory for studying the evolution of dust grains, as they are one of the only environments in the universe where it is possible to observe grains being both created and destroyed. SNRs exhibit collisionally heated dust, allowing dust to serve as a diagnostic both for grain physics and for the plasma conditions in the SNR. I present theoretical models of collisionally heated dust which calculate grain emission as well as destruction rates. In these models, I incorporate physics such as nonthermal sputtering caused by grain motions through the gas, a more realistic approach to sputtering for small grains, and arbitrary grain compositions porous and composite grains. I apply these models to infrared and X-ray observations of Kepler's supernova and the Cygnus Loop in the galaxy, and SNRs 0509-67.5, 0519-69.0, and 0540-69.3 in the LMC. X-ray observations characterize the hot plasma while IR observations constrain grain properties and destruction rates. Such a multi-wavelength approach is crucial for a complete understanding of gas and dust interaction and evolution. Modeling of both X-ray and IR spectra allows disentangling of parameters such as pre and postshock gas density, as well as swept-up masses of gas and dust, and can provide constraints on the shock compression ratio. Observations also show that the dust-to-gas mass ratio in the ISM is lower by a factor of several than what is inferred by extinction studies of starlight. Future observatories, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and the International X-ray Observatory, will allow testing of models far beyond what is possible now.</field><field name="date">2010-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03092010-171032/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Testing of Thermosyphon Batch Targets for Production of F-18</field><field name="creator">Peeples, Johanna Louise</field><field name="description">F-18 is a short-lived radioisotope commonly used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This radionuclide is typically produced through the O-18(p,n)F-18 reaction by proton bombardment of O-18 enriched water. Thermosyphon batch targets have been proposed as a means to increase F-18 production due to their enhanced heat rejection capabilities. These boiling targets have been operated with up to 3.2 kW of beam power with manageable O-18 enriched water volumes. The primary purpose of this work has been to develop a fundamental approach to target design from a modeling perspective, and to implement this approach to design new thermosyphon targets with enhanced production capabilities. Computational methods have been developed to predict target thermal performance and have been validated with experimental test data from the Duke University Medical Cyclotron and the Wisconsin Medical Cyclotron.

Functional analyses of selected cyst nematode parasitism genes that encode such secreted proteins was the objective of this dissertation. Homologs of four parasitism genes initially isolated from Heterodera glycines, including Hg4F01 (annexin-like protein), HgSYV46 (CLAVATA3-like plant peptide mimic), Hg4E02 and Hg5D08 (novel proteins with putative host nuclear localization) were isolated from Heterodera schachtii, which can infect Arabidopsis thaliana. Greater than 90% nucleotide and predicted amino acid identity existed between the four parasitism genes homologs of H. glycines and H. schachtii. mRNA in situ hybridization and immunolocalization confirmed the expression of each gene product exclusively within the nematode esophageal gland cells. Since eukaryotic annexins affect many cellular processes involving calcium-dependent membrane association, the potential function of the Hs4F01 secreted into plant cells was analyzed. Similar to annexin mutants in Arabidopsis, transgenic Arabidopsis expressing Hs4F01 produced no observable plant phenotype, but were more susceptible to nematode infection. Hypersensitivity to osmotic stress in an Arabidopsis annAt1 annexin mutant was reduced (complemented) in mutants that expressed Hs4F01, suggesting a functional similarity of nematode and plant annexins within plant cells. Host derived RNA interference (RNAi) to silence Hs4F01 transcripts significantly reduced the number of H. schachtii females developing on roots that express dsRNA to Hs4F01. Expression of Hs4E02 and Hs5D08 in Arabidopsis produced no observable plant phenotype and susceptibility to H. schachtii was not altered in plants that expressed Hs4E02. Silencing of HsSYV46 using host-derived RNAi demonstrated a significant reduction in the development of nematode females on Arabidopsis roots that expressed double-stranded RNA to HsSYV46. Expression of dsRNA to Hs4E02 and Hs5D08 in Arabidopsis roots did not affect nematode susceptibility. In summary, parasitism gene products confirmed to have cellular functions similar to their plant homologs, including Hs4F01 (annexin-like protein) and HsSYV46 (CLAVATA/ESR-like peptide) were demonstrated by RNAi to have a significant biological role in cyst nematode parasitism of host plant roots.</field><field name="date">2008-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03102008-221413/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Georgia Agricultural Teachers&#226; Perceived Ability to Balance Family and Career.</field><field name="creator">Murray, Kathryn Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the issue of career and family balance for Georgia agricultural teachers by gender.

The study was conducted as a census of all Georgia agricultural teachers on an extended day/extended year contract via an online survey. It was determined that Georgia agricultural teachers are working an average of 57 hours per week and 39 days per summer, with both genders being similar in the amount of time spent on the job. Teachers carried out traditional gender roles in family responsibilities, with females handling the majority of the housework and childcare and males handling the majority of farm and yard work. Both males and females viewed their job responsibilities to be significant barriers to fulfilling family responsibilities and one third of respondents found it was always difficult to balance career and family. It was concluded that Georgia agricultural teachers are feeling torn between meeting job expectations and spending adequate time with their families, with females feeling the strain slightly more than males.</field><field name="date">2010-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural and Extension Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03102010-140121/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Thermosyphon Targets for Production of the 18F Radionuclide.</field><field name="creator">Stokely, Matthew Hughes</field><field name="description">Single phase and boiling batch water targets are the most common designs for the cyclotron production of 18F via the 18O(p,n)18F reaction.

This anxiety over the autonomous and autonymous subject is not new, but has antecedents far back in literary history. Chaucer?s The Pardoner?s Tale, The Parson?s Tale, Milton?s Paradise Lost, and Beckett?s The Unnamable recapitulate the historical progress of the development and decline of the self-authoring subject, a progress of dislocation of significance from?in order?objects, language, and finally the subject itself. The first two writers show how to avert what Anthony Low calls the ?disastrous fall into nihilistic subjectivity,? while the third can present no such redemption.

A relational communication perspective emphasizes that within dyadic interactions (such as those that occur between a consultant and consultee); speakers are constantly redefining their roles, positions, and relationship through conversations (Erchul, Grissom, &amp; Getty, 2008). Although communication researchers have emphasized several relational themes that emerge in dyadic interactions (e.g., trust, similarity, depth; Burgoon &amp; Hale, 1984; Millar &amp; Rogers, 1976, 1987), relational communication consultation studies have almost exclusively focused on the theme of relational control (i.e., dominance-submission). This exclusionary focus on relational control has neglected other important relational themes that may characterize consultant-consultee interactions. In this study, participants listened to consultation interviews in which consultants and consultees were characterized as either high or low dominance. After listening to the interviews, participants rated consultants and consultees on several relational dimensions (e.g., involvement, trust, similarity, depth, composure, formality). Results from this study suggest that several relational dimensions are present within consultant-consultee interactions. Additionally, the presence of relational dimensions varies based on both role (i.e., school psychologist or teacher) and level of dominance. In sum, results from this current study suggest that relational dimensions other than dominance are present in consultant-consultee interactions.</field><field name="date">2008-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03112008-124815/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Multilevel Investigation of Overall Ratings of Job Performance</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Emily C</field><field name="description">Although ratings of overall job performance are a common criterion measure in I/O psychology, research dedicated to understanding how overall performance is conceptualized by the individuals responsible for evaluating performance is limited.

In the early design stages, fuzzy logic is a natural tool for modeling since it is by definition an imprecise representation. The mathematics behind fuzzy numbers have been well developed and defined in literature; yet, very little research exists in the form of fuzzy trigonometric functions. Two design problems are presented to support the motivation behind this research followed by a review of fuzzy set theory. Several approaches for mapping Y = cos(X) into the fuzzy realm are then discussed followed by the development of special purpose fuzzy trigonometric functions and fuzzy inverse trigonometric functions which are computationally simple and easy to implement. With these functions, 8 forward and 6 inverse trigonometric identities are shown to exist in the fuzzy realm. The proposal concludes by examining three engineering problems. The first problem involves the design of a fuzzy truss bridge with fuzzy forces. The second problem analyzes fuzzy forces on a block positioned on an inclined plane. The last example utilizes the fuzzy inverse trigonometric functions to calculate fuzzy bond angles within a chemical compound.</field><field name="date">2010-03-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03112010-104230/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living with Breast Cancer: Emotion-Work Strategies in Breast Cancer Support Groups</field><field name="creator">Clark, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">Research on stress and coping has attempted to explain how people deal with difficult life events, such as the diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening disease. Little attention, however, has been given to how people work together to cope with and manage the emotions evoked by such events. The present study looks at women who joined four breast cancer support groups to help them cope with the emotional fallout of the disease. Data from participant observation in these four groups, in addition to 35 in-depth interviews, are used to develop an analysis of how the women learned to cope collectively with their disease. Seven emotion-work strategies are identified and discussed, including: (a) seeking information; (b) concealing illness; (c) engaging in sexualized joking; (d) practicing compensatory femininity; (e) creating and sharing medicalized stories; (f) taking on the identity of breast cancer survivor; and (g) redefining illness as a blessing. The analysis shows how these strategies were influenced by the class-based resources the women brought with them to the groups. It also illustrates how these strategies (and thus the women?s coping efforts) were influenced and constrained by the mainstream breast cancer culture.</field><field name="date">2007-03-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03122007-104945/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Rock Cross Vane: A Comprehensive Study of an In-Stream Structure</field><field name="creator">Puckett, Paige R</field><field name="description">The rock cross vane, an in-stream boulder structure, consists of a U-shaped weir with the apex upstream at bed elevation and upward sloping arms that tie into downstream banks. The structure provides grade control, bank protection and scour pool development via a protected drop and arms that turn flow away from the banks. A physical model was used to measure the velocity distribution changes caused by a range of geometric configurations of the structure. Results showed linear and quadratic effects of drop ratio, cross product effects of drop ratio and arm angle, drop ratio and arm slope, and arm angle and arm slope on the velocity ratio (the average center velocity to the average outer velocity) of a cross section located two bankfull widths downstream of the drop. The Rock Cross Vane Rapid Assessment Tool (RCV-RAT) was developed to rate rock cross vane failures and assess the causes of structure weakness on NC stream restoration projects. Failure ratings were analyzed for significant correlations to project parameters, class effects of project, and correlations between dependent variables (alpha =0.05). Of the 120 rock cross vanes observed, 109 had at least one incidence of failure ranging from slight to extreme. From this data, an FMEA was developed to compare the risks of the various modes of failure for the rock cross vane and to adapt the FMEA for use in North Carolina stream projects. It was concluded that sufficient drop is necessary for scour pool development, while steep, narrow arms leading to a constricted flow area minimally contribute to scour pool development and may risk bank instability at the structure and at downstream banks. Rock cross vanes that can tolerate rapid lateral migration of the stream post-construction should be developed and tested due to the observed problems of structure side cutting. The final chapter reviews literature for the main effects of stream restoration on benthic macroinvertebrate communities and the expected return of benthic macroinvertebrate communities post-restoration to address what impacts the rock cross vane might have on benthic macroinvertebrates and to recommend practices that might reduce these impacts.</field><field name="date">2007-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03122007-111706/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between WISC-IV Scores and North Carolina State Achievement Test Scores</field><field name="creator">Tayrose, Michelle Parker</field><field name="description">The historical correlation between intellectual functioning and academic achievement is largely based on individually administered achievement tests. However, the standards-based reform movement and recent special education legislation emphasize group-based achievement tests and allow for the use of state-based tests in eligibility determinations. Importantly, there does not exist research examining the IQ-achievement relationship using standards-based tests; thus, the current study evaluated the correlation between the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) and those tests comprising the North Carolina assessment program (i.e., End-of-Grade (EOG) tests). Five NC school psychologists provided archival information on students (n = 76) and results yielded support for the two hypotheses, which postulated that confidence intervals placed around correlation coefficients between Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) scores and EOG-Reading and &#226;Mathematics scores would capture r =.6, which is roughly halfway between the range of historical correlations. Implications regarding the validity of the WISC-IV and its potential use in identifying learning disabilities in which achievement is measured by tests linked to state standards, as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03122008-104332/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fluorescence microscopy study of the dynamics of low-pH triggered Membrane Fusion</field><field name="creator">Wessels, Laura</field><field name="description">Enveloped viruses employ membrane fusion during cell penetration in order to deliver their genetic material across the cell boundary. Large conformational changes in the proteins embedded in the viral membrane play a fundamental role in the membrane fusion process. Despite the tremendously wide variety of membrane containing viruses, it appears they all contain membrane fusion protein machinery with a remarkably conserved mechanism of action. The purpose of the research in this dissertation was to experimentally observe real time dynamic membrane fusion using fluorescence microscopy. An in vitro assay fusing viral membranes to supported lipid bilayers, triggered by the exposure to low pH and visualized with fluorescent dye molecules, was developed to observe viral membrane fusion. Studies of influenza and Sindbis virus were conducted with this assay. The intermediate structures of membrane fusion are too small to be spatially resolved with an optical microscope due to the diffraction limit, however fluorescence dequenching of dye molecules inserted into the viral membrane/lipid membrane system can provide information about the dynamics of membrane fusion as well as providing insight into the sequence of conformational changes of the lipid bilayer. Effects of adding the dye labels to the viruses are also investigated.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03122009-110611/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying Confidence Levels and Instructional Strategies of High School Agriculture Education Teachers When Working with Students with Special Needs.</field><field name="creator">Stair, Kristin Shawn</field><field name="description">In Agricultural Education, teachers are experiencing increased student diversity within their classrooms. The purpose of this study was to identify the confidence levels of high school agriculture teachers and to determine what strategies they are using when working with students with special needs. The population of this study consisted of secondary agriculture teachers in the United States. One state was randomly selected from each region of National Association of Agriculture Educator (NAAE) regions and a stratified random sampling method was used to ensure representation from all states. A random sample size of 333 was selected with a total response rate of 62%. Participants completed a survey instrument that measured teacher confidence, identified which strategies they used most often, how effective they felt those strategies were and collected demographic information. Analysis of the collected data showed that teachers are using recognized practices in their classes though they are more likely to use techniques associated with good teaching practices rather than strategies that are specifically designed to benefit students with special needs. This research also showed that teachers are confident in their abilities, however they generally disagreed that their teacher training program prepared them to work with students with disabilities. Multiple regression was used to identify predictors of teacher confidence. The best fitting prediction model consisted of three variables: participating in in-service opportunities related to special education, age, and having a friend or family member with a disability. This model had a total R2 of .118 accounting for almost 12% of the total variance in predictors of total confidence Teacher training programs should focus on providing opportunities for teachers to gain experience by working with students with special needs and to learn specific strategies for teaching students within this population.</field><field name="date">2009-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural and Extension Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03122009-164619/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brand Congruity and Purchase Intentions of Runners</field><field name="creator">Leksrisompong, Chanatip</field><field name="description">Running continues to be one of the more popular sports enjoyed by all ages. Regardless of the popularity of the sport, limited research currently exists to quantify the apparel purchase behavior of runners. This research studied variables that influenced purchase intentions of runners at different levels of involvement. The runners were categorized by the dualistic theory of passion, and their purchase intentions toward apparel brands for running were investigated from the self-congruity perspective. Runners completed an online survey that provided comprehensive information on their running behavior and their past and future apparel purchases. Exploratory factor analysis was used to investigate the dualistic theory of passion and self-congruity theory on the running population. Four variables were found to be important predictors of purchase intentions for all runners: Self-Image Congruence, Function, Aesthetic, and Technology Appeal. Further, logistic regression was used to determine which variables significantly influenced purchase intentions of runners in each category. Based on the findings, a theoretical framework was proposed. This study concluded that functional attributes of running apparel influence runners&#226; purchase intentions.</field><field name="date">2010-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03122010-133742/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Environmentally Significant Behavior Among Guides in the Garhwal Himalaya</field><field name="creator">Serenari, Christopher</field><field name="description">A gap currently exists in research pertaining to the utility of low impact outdoor ethics in non-Western societies. Many non-Western societies rely on their own religious beliefs, cultural perceptions, and traditions to serve as the foundation for conservation and environmental protection and influence related behavior. This notion also includes guides, who have been identified as effective in altering client behavior and minimizing environmentally destructive behavior. Exploratory research was conducted in Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India in 2009 applying the Theory of Planned Behavior to identify those cognitive factors that lead whitewater and trekking guides to pack out trash, bury human waste, and cut living trees for firewood. Results suggest that the foundational constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior are capable of predicting intention to perform pro-environmental behavior in a non-Western population of guides; however, their utility depends on the behavior performed.

Until recently their mode of action was thought to be solely through inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), which along with its products such as prostaglandin E2, are upregulated in tumors. However, gene regulation may, in part, explain the alterations in invasion, apoptosis, and/or cell proliferation seen with NSAIDs. In this report, we utilized microarray analysis of colorectal cancer cells treated with low, non-toxic concentrations of sulindac sulfide to show that the active metabolite of this NSAID and potent cancer chemopreventive drug regulates the expression of a variety of genes. Several genes related to cell growth and apoptosis, while others were transcription factors, which are important regulators of gene expression. NSAIDs such as the Cox-1 specific inhibitor SC-560 and the Cox-2 specific inhibitor SC-58125 modulated the expression of these genes in HCT-116 colorectal cancer cells, which correlated with the biological activity but not Cox-2 inhibitory activity of these compounds. Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3) was one gene identified as induced by a variety of NSAIDs and confirmed in a variety of cell lines in our laboratory. ATF3 was induced by a variety of other compounds with cancer chemopreventive activity such as the PPAR gamma ligand troglitazone (TGZ) and the dietary compounds diallyl disulfide (DADS), resveratrol, and genistein. To ascertain the biological significance of the induction of ATF3, we overexpressed ATF3 in the sense and antisense orientation. Overexpression of ATF3 in the sense orientation reduced the size of mouse tumor xenografts by 54 percent in vivo. One explanation for the biological activity of ATF3 is down-stream gene modulation. Using microarray analysis, overexpression of ATF3 in the sense orientation regulated several genes related to invasion and metastasis. ATF3 overexpression decreased focus formation and inhibited invasion potential in vitro to a similar degree as sulindac sulfide treatment. Conversely, antisense ATF3 overexpression increased invasion potential and focus formation. Therefore, the biological activity of these compounds may be linked to the gene regulator role of ATF3. Lastly, we demonstrated that ATF3 is modulated by the transcription factor Early Growth Response Gene-1 (Egr-1). The induction of ATF3 by sulindac sulfide and TGZ at the mRNA, protein, and promoter level required Egr-1 and the Extracellular regulated kinase-1/2 (Erk-1/2) MAPK pathway. In conclusion, NSAIDs and other chemopreventive compounds alter the expression of a number of genes, in particular transcription factors, which may be linked to the biological activity of these compounds. Lastly, we dispute the dogma that ATF3 is solely a stress response gene and provide evidence that ATF3 has anti-cancer activity warranting further investigation.</field><field name="date">2005-03-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132005-101341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variations in Student Development Trajectories in Reading and Mathematics: A Multilevel Growth Mixture Model Approach.</field><field name="creator">Ward, Stephen James</field><field name="description">Lack of student achievement has long been a cause of national concern. The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) act of 2001 represents the latest attempt to both correct past educational inequities and to improve the competitiveness of American education. NCLB mandates that all students must meet proficiency standards by the 2013-14 school year. To determine whether students are on track to meet this goal, NCLB uses the metric of Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). Presently, AYP appears to be set in terms of what is required to meet the 2013-14 goal with no consideration of how student growth and development actually occurs. Moreover, this type of goal assumes that all students can develop or progress at the same rate, in other word, ?one size fits all.? This study sought to examine this ?one size fits all? assumption through the examination of unobserved heterogeneity in student growth trajectories. Specifically, this study sought to determine whether student growth trajectories in reading and mathematics between grade 3 and grade 8 could be adequately described by either single or multiple classes of growth using a multi-level growth mixture modeling approach. Further, the study examined the effects of gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, parental education, and Local Educational Area (LEA) funding upon these growth trajectories. In terms of classes of growth trajectories, the results clearly suggest the existence of multiple classes of growth for both reading and mathematics. All individual level covariates influenced either membership in a growth class or the latent growth factors or both class membership and growth factors. In contrast, LEA level funding covariates effects were in general not supported. Relationships, for the most part, were consistent across primary and replication samples. Lastly, implications for educational practice, educational policy, Industrial/Organization psychology, and research are discussed along with the limitations of the present study.</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132007-100523/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genomic and Molecular Analyses of the Core DNA Replication Machinery in Plants</field><field name="creator">Shultz, Randall William</field><field name="description">Accurate and complete DNA replication is essential for maintaining the integrity of the genome. In eukaryotes, this process requires the coordinated action of numerous molecular machines. Based on yeast and animal model systems, we defined a set of fifty-one ?core DNA replication proteins? that are integral to the initiation, DNA synthesis, and Okazaki fragment maturation functions of DNA replication. We used computational analyses to identify putative homologs in the genomes of two plants, Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and Oryza sativa (rice), providing the first comprehensive view of the core DNA replication machinery in plants. Our results indicated that the overall composition of this apparatus is conserved, but plants are unique in that multiple DNA replication genes exist as small gene families. Fourteen of the genes we annotated in this study have not been previously reported in the literature, and we have provided revised gene models for seventeen plant proteins. To better understand how the DNA replication machinery functions in plants, we cloned multiple subunits of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC) from Arabidopsis and generated antibodies against four key components of this complex ? AtORC1, AtORC2, AtMCM5, and AtMCM7. We demonstrated that the pre-RC is developmentally regulated in Arabidopsis and, consistent with a role in DNA replication, is abundant in proliferating tissues. We used immunocytochemical and biochemical methods to characterize MCM7 in plants. We observed two distinct localization patterns for plant MCM7 proteins. In most cells, MCM7 was nuclear and colocalized with DNA. In a small fraction of cells, MCM7 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasmic compartment. Biochemical analysis confirmed that MCM7 binds to chromatin and that it is present in the nucleus at least during the G1, S and G2 cell cycle stages. Together, these analyses support a model where the MCM complex is loaded onto DNA in late M and early G1, released into the nucleoplasm during S phase followed by a brief dispersion into the cytoplasmic compartment concurrent with nuclear envelope breakdown in mitosis.</field><field name="date">2007-04-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functional Genomics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132007-124000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Red Weather Sacrifice</field><field name="creator">Castro, Cesar E</field><field name="description">This collection of poems examines Latino migration to the United States from the perspective of a Central American immigrant on U.S. soil.

Yield stability has often been associated with genetic diversity. Observing cotton lint yield in diverse population types containing various levels and kinds of genetic diversity over many environments could reveal information about stability and how it relates to diversity. An 18-environment field study was undertaken to observe lint yield stability in four population types of cotton. These populations were pure lines grown in pure stands (homozygous/homogeneous), pure lines grown in blended stands (homozygous/heterogeneous), hybrids grown in pure stands (heterozygous/homogeneous), and hybrids grown in blended stands (heterozygous/heterogeneous). Lint yield components were also observed to determine the contribution each had towards lint yield stability. Differences were determined by observing the coefficient of variation (CV) for mean yield and yield components of population types and over environments. We found the heterozygous populations to be more stable than the homozygous populations. This was attributed to the hybrids and blends of hybrids out-yielding the parents and blends of parents in the low-yielding environments. This advantage was not observed in the high-yielding environments and, in effect, reduced the amount of variation observed over all environments. The number of bolls/hectare was the only yield component that showed definitive differences for stability between population types with the heterozygous populations having significantly higher stability than the homozygous populations. The superior stability of the heterozygous populations was attributed to an increased lint production in the lower yielding environments stemming from an increased number of bolls/hectare.</field><field name="date">2007-04-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132007-145659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Multilocus Linkage Disequilibrium Structure in the Human Genome</field><field name="creator">Kim, Yunjung</field><field name="description">The International HapMap Project and high- throughput genotyping technology have generated millions of genome-wide marker data that can be used in genetic studies. Each marker can be analyzed separately. But analyzing multiple markers simultaneously through haplotypes has generated great interest recently. Understanding the haplotype structure in the human genome may provide important information on human evolutionary history and identification of genetic variants responsible for human complex diseases. Since the alleles at closely linked markers on a single chromosome are often in statistical dependence (i.e. linkage disequilibrium (LD)), one crucial aspect of haplotype analysis is to characterize LD patterns in different regions and different populations. To assess the extent of correlation of genetic variation at multiple markers in a given region and a population, pairwise LD measures such as and have been commonly used. However, pairwise LD measures alone may be suboptimal to effectively capture the variability of background levels of disequilibrium since multilocus LD measures can provide information about simultaneous allele associations among multiple loci which pairwise LD measures miss. In addition, in order to fully characterize the haplotype structure and LD pattern at multiple markers, it is necessary to consider high order disequilibria and estimate their values.</field><field name="date">2008-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132008-075346/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanistic Investigations of Alkane Activation and Reaction on Zeolitic Catalysts</field><field name="creator">Truitt, Matthew Jarrod</field><field name="description">Alkylates are branched hydrocarbons used in motor fuels to provide octane enhancements. Unfortunately current production methods require the use of environmentally dangerous materials and produce large quantities of hazardous wastes. Zeolites could provide a safer process for alkylate synthesis, but mechanistic complications lead to a loss of selectivity, and eventually catalyst deactivation making their use impractical. Using a combination of variable-temperature solid-state NMR experiments which provide in-situ mechanistic information, and gas-phase pulsed microreactor experiments which provide information about the reaction selectivity and activity, alkane activation and reaction on zeolites has been investigated. Experiments from this work have shown: (1) H/D exchange can occur between perdeuterated isobutane and zeolites in the absence of olefins in adsorbed gas; (2) isobutane forms an adsorption complex with the catalyst selectively at the active Bronsted acid site; (3) there is insufficient residual carbon in the catalyst to initiate/mediate H/D exchange and it is unlikely such a species&#226; presence would initiate/mediate exchange; (4) reactor data indicates structural isomerizations, cracking, alkylation, etc. do not occur for isobutane in H-ZSM-5 for the temperatures H/D exchange was monitored by the NMR work; (5) both the acid site and methyl peaks&#226; kinetic data are in agreement; all of which give evidence of a direct protonation step for H/D exchange. The activation energy and mechanism of this direct H/D exchange were verified computationally. The mechanism was shown to involve a non-classical hydrogen bond between a methyl C-H of the adsorbed isobutane and an adjacent oxygen at the Bronsted acidic site.</field><field name="date">2008-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132008-115325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spatial Asset Management Study Through an Analysis of Pavement Marking Performance</field><field name="creator">Sitzabee, William E</field><field name="description">This research evaluates pavement marking performance characteristics of NC&#226;s highways and proposes asset management guidelines that will enable NC to effectively implement new Federal standards.

The target genes of TFs also may be associated with disease. Identification of potential TF targets could further our understanding of gene-gene interactions underlying complex disease. We focused on two TFs, USF1 and ZNF217, because of their biological importance, especially their known genetic association with coronary artery disease (CAD), and the availability of chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) results. First, we used USF1 ChIP-chip data as a training dataset to develop and evaluate several kernel logistic regression prediction models. Our most accurate predictor significantly outperformed standard PWM-based prediction methods. This novel prediction method enables a more accurate and efficient genome-scale identification of USF1 binding and associated target genes. Second, the results from independent linkage and gene expression studies suggest that ZNF217 also may be a candidate gene for CAD. We further investigated the role of ZNF217 for CAD in three independent CAD samples with different phenotypes. Our association studies of ZNF217 identified three SNPs having consistent association with CAD in three samples. Aorta expression profiling indicated that the proportion of the aorta with raised lesions was also positively correlated to ZNF217 expression. The combined evidence suggests that ZNF217 is a novel susceptibility gene for CAD. Finally, we applied our previously developed TF binding site (TFBS) prediction method to ZNF217. The performance of the prediction models of ZNF217 and USF1 are very similar. We demonstrated that our TFBS prediction method can be extended to other TFs. In summary, the results of this dissertation research are (1) evaluation of two TFs, USF1 and ZNF217, as susceptibility factors for CAD; (2) development of a generalized method for TFBS prediction; (3) prediction of TFBSs and target genes of two TFs, and identification of SNPs within TFBSs. This research allows for the development of study design to access TF based interactions in genetic susceptibility to human complex disease.</field><field name="date">2009-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132009-120540/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Driving Through Dusk</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Elizabeth Wood</field><field name="description">This is a collection of original poetry.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03132009-145003/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hamilton Cycle Heuristics in Hard Graphs</field><field name="creator">Shields, Ian Beaumont</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we use computer methods to investigate Hamilton cycles and paths in several families of graphs where general results are incomplete, including Kneser graphs, cubic Cayley graphs and the middle two levels graph.

This creates potential for additional genetic gains available through production populations (PP) to forest plantations. Open-nucleus strategies (NB) have been incorporated in forest tree breeding programs. In NB, the BP is subdivided into two hierarchical levels, a nucleus and a main population, and can be considered a less rigorous form of PAM. First, PAM was compared to NB by stochastic simulation considering jointly genetic gain and diversity within the framework of a long-term breeding program. Test effort was either assumed constant throughout the entire BP or was redirected according to the rank of each mate. The simulation revealed that PAM results in larger gains in the PP compared to NB under both situations and at any target PP diversity. Second, the test effort during PAM was redirected by varying family sizes as a linear function of mid-parent BLUP values. The actual distribution of mid-parent BLUP values was standardized by a constant value, which was varied in simulation scenarios to cover the entire range of the distribution of family sizes. When equal numbers of progenies were selected per family and the variation in family sizes was maximized, only a minimal reduction in BP diversity was observed, compared to cases with constant family sizes. Under such favorable conditions, the redistribution of resources increased genetic response and variance in the BP, causing substantially greater genetic response in the PP. These conclusions were verified under a mixed-inheritance model with a major-gene locus contributing to variation in a quantitative trait. Finally, the investigation of PAM was extended by considering correlated traits within the framework of a clonal forestry program. The success of somatic embryogenesis in families generated by crossing elite genotypes developed in the breeding program was either considered exponentially distributed or constant. The distribution of success caused non-significant differences in genetic gain of PP. These conclusions were verified over a range of correlation, heritabilities and economic weights of traits.</field><field name="date">2005-03-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03142005-083542/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstruction of Lambertian Surfaces from Photometric Stereo</field><field name="creator">Sethuram, Amrutha Shree</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to implement and compare two algorithms to reconstruct the shape of an object from photometric stereo. Photometric stereo is a practical technique for determining an object?s shape and surface reflectance properties at a distance. The implementation proposes the use of three images of an object, recorded from the same viewpoint but with different illumination. The first algorithm employs the Fourier transform method to solve the minimization problem. The gradient data is obtained by incorporating photometric stereo method on image triplets. The Fourier transform of the unknown surface is then expressed as a function of the Fourier transform of the gradients. The relative depth values are then obtained by applying an inverse Fourier transform of the function. The second algorithm is based on iterative reconstruction which minimizes the cost function by gradient descent and annealing. Both these algorithms are implemented to reconstruct both real and synthetic surfaces and the results are compared. It is also shown that better reconstruction results are obtained by adopting the second algorithm in the presence of discontinuities in the image. Noise sensitivity of the frequency-domain method is also evaluated. An experimental setup to obtain real world images is also presented.</field><field name="date">2005-03-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03142005-133624/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inheritance of fruit characteristics and disease resistance in watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. &amp; Nakai]</field><field name="creator">Gusmini, Gabriele</field><field name="description">The watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. &amp; Nakai var. lanatus] is a major vegetable crop in the United States. The genetics of this crop have been widely studied and several genes reported. Nevertheless, further investigation was needed for genes determining the appearance of the fruit (rind and flesh colors), the weight of single fruit, and resistance to gummy stem blight, a severe disease of watermelon caused by Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm. In this work the inheritance of novel rind phenotypes was measured and the genetics of flesh color verified. Three new genes were identified: Dr for the deep-red flesh color of 'Dixielee' and 'Red-N-Sweet', Yb for the yellow belly of 'Black Diamond Yellow Belly', and is for the intermittent stripes of 'Navajo Sweet'. The spotted phenotype from 'Moon and Stars' was transferred to light green and gray cultivar for the development of novel varieties with distinctive rind patterns. Yield of 80 diverse cultivars was evaluated in replicated experiments. Some of the new, elite hybrid cultivars were in the top yielding group, however old, inbred cultivars appeared in the top group as well. Consistent and significant differences among the 80 cultivars tested suggests genetic variation for yield. Since most watermelon consumers are interested in smaller fruit, six adapted cultivars bearing the largest and smallest fruit were crossed in a half-diallel, producing F1, F2, and backcross generations. Genotypic variances, heritability, and gain from selection were estimated. High environmental variance and low narrow- and broad-sense heritability were recorded. Finally, the inheritance of resistance to gummy stem blight, previously attributed to the db gene, was verified. A genetic system more complex than a single gene seems to regulate the transmission of resistance from resistant to susceptible germplasm. Due to the complexity of phenotypic testing for this disease in watermelon, a new project for the development of molecular markers linked to resistance was initiated. Nevertheless, the use of F3 phenotypic data and F2 genotypic markers and the apparent complexity of the trait did not allow the identification of a tightly linked marker.</field><field name="date">2005-03-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03142005-141526/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenology of the Twospotted Spider Mite Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae) in North Carolina Tomato Systems</field><field name="creator">Meck, Elijah</field><field name="description">The twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is a cosmopolitan and highly polyphagous pest of many fruits, vegetables, ornamentals, and field crops. While twospotted spider mite is a well-documented pest of corn and peanuts in eastern North Carolina, only recently has it been recognized as a consistent and serious pest of vegetables in the piedmont and mountains of North Carolina. Mites infest a number of vegetables in North Carolina including tomato, pepper, eggplant, and sweet corn, but tomato is by far the most seriously affected crop. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the effect of vegetation on the dispersal of twospotted spider mites from tomatoes to overwintering hosts, and 2) to investigate the potential importance of various factors, including location, planting date, field history, surrounding area, pesticide use, and mite populations in surrounding vegetation, that may affect mite infestations in tomato fields in different regions of North Carolina. Two vegetation management techniques (herbicide and cultivation) plus an untreated control plot were established around senescing tomato plants. Twospotted spider mite dispersal was monitored by planting chickweed trap plants at 2, 6, and 12 m from the tomatoes. Sampling took place in the fall of 2004 &amp; 2005 and the spring of 2005 &amp; 2006. Only a small number of mites were collected in the 2004-2005 sampling period, making it difficult to draw conclusions. The 2005-2006 sampling period showed that herbicide-treated soil facilitated mite dispersal in the fall, while there were no differences in mite populations among treatments in the spring, suggesting a high rate of overwintering mortality. Tomato fields in the mountains and piedmont region were sampled in a grid pattern on a bimonthly basis to determine the importance of year, location, planting date, previous crop, adjacent crop, insecticide use, acaricide use, and mite populations in surrounding vegetation on mite intensities in those fields. Based on samples from 80 tomato fields, previous crop, acaricide use, insecticide use, and mite intensity in the weeds were important factors that were associated with seasonal mite intensity in tomato fields. Acaricide use and mite intensity in the weeds were important factors associated with the maximum mite intensity in tomatoes. Year, location, planting date, and acaricide use were all important factors associated with the time it took for tomato fields to reach their maximum density. Upon further analysis, it was found that none of the dependent variables (year, location, previous crop, adjacent crop, planting date, acaricide use, insecticide use) were associated with seasonal mite intensity in weeds or mite intensity in weeds on the last two sample dates. However, previous crop and insecticide use were significant factors associated with mite intensity in weeds on the first two sample dates. Furthermore, seasonal mite intensity in weeds was significantly correlated with seasonal and maximum mite intensity in tomato fields. While previous crop, current season insecticide use, and mite intensity in weeds were factors associated with mite intensities in the field, a high overwintering mortality appeared to negate the effects of these factors; consequently it was not possible to predict in advance fields that were most susceptible to high mite infestations. Acaricides will likely remain a key management strategy in the near future, and the development of sampling plans and economic thresholds will be necessary to use these materials in a judicious manner.</field><field name="date">2007-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03142007-082718/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does Personality Predict Perceived Performance Change Following a Leader Development Intervention?</field><field name="creator">Kail, Eric Guy</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research has been to investigate personality as a predictor for perceived performance change following a leader training program. A sample of 363 leaders attended a five day leader development training program at a centralized location. Approximately 90-120 days after returning to work in their organizations, participating leader received a 360-degree assessment in order to determine that amount of perceived performance change. Personality was measured using the CPI260, and results were mapped onto the Five Factor model of personality. Personality was investigated both as dimensions of the Five Factor model and as types. Personality types were determined via cluster analysis. Personality was further investigated as a moderating the relationship between self-other rating discrepancy and perceived performance change. Results suggest that personality, either by dimension or type, can be used as a predictor in determining perceived performance change following a leader development intervention. Personality was not found to moderate the relationship between self-other rating discrepancy and perceived performance change.

They argue that authors find it impossible to portray women properly in both roles?one persona always eclipses the other. The conflict is generally attributed to the traditionally ?masculine? and conventional nature of the detective genre. This study proposes that the recent combination of detective fiction with the conventionally ?feminine? genre of romance fiction offers hope for a feminist rewriting of the detective genre. A set of guidelines to subtly re-script detective fiction?s conventions is derived from suggestions by several critics, and is heavily influenced by typical elements of romance fiction. The usefulness of this framework in identifying the characteristics of more empowered and fully developed female detectives is tested by a close reading of three representative works from various points in the history of detective fiction. The three works, which include Wilkie Collins?s The Woman in White, Carolyn Keene?s Nancy Drew series, and Janet Evanovich?s Stephanie Plum series, each incorporate a combination of romance and detective fiction and feature a female investigator. The framework proves useful in assessing the achievements and failures in the characterization of female detectives in these novels. It also offers guidelines that could be considered by authors of future detective works to re-script the most conservative elements of the detective fiction genre so that they no longer prevent the emergence of successful, empowered female detectives.</field><field name="date">2007-03-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03142007-151252/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deployment, Testing and Analysis of Advanced Thermosyphon Target Systems for Production of Aqueous [18F]Fluoride via 18O(p,n)18F</field><field name="creator">Stokely, Matthew Hughes</field><field name="description">Single phase and boiling batch water targets are the most common designs for the cyclotron production of 18F via the 18O(p,n)18F reaction.

As part of the Coastal Ocean Research and Monitoring Program (CORMP) at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, a quadrapod frame with a downward looking Pulse-Coherent Acoustic Doppler Profiler (PC-ADP) and an upward looking Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) has been maintained on the continental shelf at approximately 30 m depth since May of 2000. The instruments are moored 27 nautical miles off the coast of Wilmington, North Carolina in Onslow Bay, adjacent to a productive marine hardbottom. Simultaneous measurements of flow velocities from the surface to the seabed, along with acoustic backscatter measurements, have been obtained. Measurements of seabed elevation, temperature, conductivity, and pressure were also collected at the site. Bed stresses due to wave-current interactions are calculated using a bottom boundary layer model (Styles and Glenn, 2002). Wave-current interactions resulted in shear stresses at the sediment-water interface that exceeded the critical threshold for sediment movement over 50% of the time during a climatological average year. Sediment transport was been shown to occur during four different types of events at the site: 1) small to moderate northerly wind events 2) Gulf Stream Intrusion events 3) strong southerly wind events associated with the passage of frontal systems 4) the passage of tropical storm systems. Over the course of a year the total net suspended sediment flux at 1 mab was in the positive along-shelf direction (southwest) and in the negative across-shelf direction (onshore), where there was several times more net transport in the onshore direction than the along-shelf direction. Three mechanisms leading to significant sediment transport on the mid-continental shelf have been indentified: 1) wave-current interactions 2) subtidal currents associated with sustained wind-driven flows and the intrusion of Gulf Stream water on the shelf 3) infragravity waves. Subtidal currents played a key role in the sediment transport during all types of events. Wind driven subtidal currents were important in determining the magnitude and direction of sediment transport during storm events, while subtidal currents associated with a Gulf Stream intrusion event combined with fair-weather swell resulted in accretion at the site of 3 cm over a three week period. The results show that a moderate northeasterly wind event with sufficient duration to generate wind driven subtidal flows resulted in an order of magnitude more sediment transport (20,237 g cm&lt;sup&gt;?2&lt;/sup&gt;) than a similar northerly wind event and the southerly wind event without developed wind?driven flows. These two events resulted in similar amounts of sediment transport of 3,600 g cm&lt;sup&gt;?2&lt;/sup&gt; and 3,061 g cm&lt;sup&gt;?2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The passage of a hurricane resulted in an order of magnitude more sediment transport than the moderate northeasterly wind event, on the order of 240,000 g cm&lt;sup&gt;?2&lt;/sup&gt;. Shear velocities during the passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in the largest bed shear stresses (~300 dynes cm&lt;sup&gt;?2&lt;/sup&gt;) on record. Field measurements in the bottom boundary layer were compared with the bblm generated current profiles during moderate wind events and Hurricane Isabel. In addition, the suspended sediment concentration profiles from the model were compared with the ABS profile measurements to verify shape and magnitude as the storms increased and waned. In general, there was good agreement between the measured and model derived current profiles, and between suspended sediment measurements and the model concentration profiles for both large and small-scale events that occurred at the site.</field><field name="date">2004-03-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03152004-100655/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Character Education Program: Moral Development, Self-Esteem and At-Risk Youth</field><field name="creator">Scott, David A.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the results of a deliberate psychological and educational intervention with at-risk youth that have been identified as having potential to benefit from a character education program.

Swidler?s (1986) framework linking ideology, culture and action provided a means of studying civic responsibility at two research universities, the University of Virginia (UVA) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The purposes of the study were (a) to understand dominant institutional beliefs about civic responsibility at two research universities, and (b) to understand how their institutional cultures contribute to unique institutional approaches to civic responsibility, specifically for the areas of student involvement and development. This ethnographic study examined campus ideologies and cultural forms that addressed five dimensions of civic responsibility: (a) knowledge and support of democratic values, systems and processes, (b) desire to act beneficially in community and for its members, (c) use of knowledge and skills for societal benefit, (d) appreciation for and interest in those unlike self, and (e) personal accountability. Data collection involved interviews, field observations and document analysis at both campuses. Student questionnaires and site summary reviewers were used to ensure trustworthiness of the findings. Data was analyzed for each site independently, and then a cross-site analysis was conducted. The ideologies, cultures and actions specific to the two institutions aligned with Swidler's framework and yielded two unique institutional approaches to civic responsibility, namely the "test bed" and "role model" approaches. The significance of the findings from the cross-site analysis are multi-fold, with implications for both organization studies and student development.</field><field name="date">2006-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03152006-113756/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of Web Conferencing Technology in Student-Teacher Conferencing in the Writing Classroom: A Study of First-Year Student Writers</field><field name="creator">Samuels, Laura Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In the past few years, composition theorists have become increasingly interested in the role of computers in the first-year writing classroom. This explorative, case study investigates the use of Web conferencing software as a medium for student-teacher writing conferences. Using qualitative methodology, this researcher conducted out-of-class Web conferences with three first-year writing students about their performance on the first major writing project of the spring 2006 semester. The researcher was also the students? English 101 instructor. Following the Web conferences, the researcher used in depth interviewing techniques to discuss the students? experiences. Data from the recorded Web conferences and transcripts of the post-conference interviews were analyzed to determine answers to the following two research questions: What benefits and challenges do students and teachers find with online Web conferencing and how do these benefits and challenges affect the cyber replication of a face-to-face conference? The results of this study indicate that it is possible to replicate a face-to-face student-teacher conference through Web conferencing technologies. Some of the benefits of Web conferencing include (but are not limited to) the constant availability for students and instructors to have conferences (outside of the traditional business hours that most university buildings are available) and the ability to have an oral discussion in place of a text-based discussion, where it is often difficult for instructors to encapsulate their overall response. Additionally, this study investigates some of the challenges to Web conferencing, such as the lack of a physical presence of the two participants and the inability to conduct global writing revisions due to the lack of screen space available on the computer monitor. Finally, this study has important implications for conferencing in the first-year writing classroom and opens the door for future Web conferencing studies to be conducted on a larger scale with different population samples.</field><field name="date">2006-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03152006-165554/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How long should we follow the leader? Using latent growth models of longitudinal leadership performance change to predict leader outcomes.</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Torrey Rieser</field><field name="description">A paucity of research has examined longitudinal performance and the predictive ability of performance change on important outcomes. In addition, few studies have investigated the effects of rater variables on performance over time and the effect of rater group composition or rater perspective on longitudinal performance ratings. The purpose of this research was to investigate consequences related to rater characteristics including rater context, perspective and composition in the measurement and prediction of longitudinal performance. Results suggested that longitudinal self-ratings, boss ratings, and direct report ratings were equivalent. The results of this study also concur with earlier findings about the dynamic nature of performance (Thoreson, et al., 2004). Longitudinal change in performance was found for every leadership performance factor in ratings from every rater group. Latent growth curves for all rater groups were remarkably similar although boss ratings showed the most consistent longitudinal change. Adding sector and/or subdivision covariates to the models improved model fit for each rating source group. Using growth mixture modeling with the rater context covariates allowed the estimation of latent classes that clarified the direction of leadership performance growth. Results also indicated the importance of rater composition. Direct reports who consistently rated the same leader tended to rate those leaders more highly than the direct reports who rated different leaders. Adding the composition moderator variable to the boss rating models improved model fit for four of the five leadership performance models. The composition covariate also significantly predicted the intercept and slope for boss ratings of Ethics and Character, suggesting that obtaining leadership performance ratings from consistent bosses plays an important role in detecting linear change in leader performance, especially for ratings of Ethics and Character. Leaders with positive development on Ethics and Character had higher consensus performance scores, confirming past research showing that integrity and ethical behavior are important characteristics in successful managers (Posner &amp; Schmidt, 1984; Mortensen, Smith, &amp; Cavanagh, 1989).</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03152007-090353/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students?

The dissertation describes the research study results of a brief psychoeducational group that was employed to teach self-advocacy skills to Black adolescents, with the ultimate goal of improving their academic self-concept and academic motivation.</field><field name="date">2010-03-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselor Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03152010-094419/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Phenology of the Apple Maggot Fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae), in the Southern Appalachians</field><field name="creator">Giudici, Michelle Catherine</field><field name="description">In contrast to many apple production areas, the phenology of the apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), is not well understood in North Carolina and other areas of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Studies in western North Carolina in the 1970?s reported a single flight period that occurred from mid-June to mid-September, with peak fight activity occurring in late July. More recent monitoring in Henderson County, NC, showed evidence of a bimodal emergence, with the first emergence occurring in late May to early June, and the second from mid July through August. It was not clear if this represented a bimodal emergence pattern or completion of two generations. The objectives of this study were to gain a better understanding of the phenology of the apple maggot in apple-producing regions of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, to examine the post-diapause development requirements among early and late-emerging populations in North Carolina, and to determine if phenologically and geographically distinct apple maggot populations could be differentiated genetically using the COI gene of mitochondrial DNA. Apple maggot flight was monitored in abandoned apple orchards in western North Carolina and South Carolina that represented a diversity of elevations. A distinct bimodal flight pattern was observed at all locations. A second generation was also observed at lower elevations (300-330 m) in Polk County, NC, and Spartanburg County, SC. Only one generation was evident at higher elevations (&gt;600 m) in North Carolina. Among early and late-emerging groups, the post-diapause developmental period was shorter in the early emerging groups compared to late-emerging groups. Based on sequences of the mitochondrial gene COI, no significant differences were found between early or late-emerging groups. Furthermore, analysis of the COI gene did not detect geographic isolation among populations from North Carolina, South Carolina, Massachusetts, and West Virginia, or among populations in Henderson, Polk, and McDowell Counties in North Carolina. Blueberry maggot, Rhagoletis mendax Currans, from New Jersey did not differ at the COI gene from apple maggot populations in North Carolina and South Carolina, and were most closely related to the Upward Road location in Henderson County.</field><field name="date">2006-05-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03162006-082548/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defying the "Destructives": Confederate Disaffection and Disloyalty in North Carolina's Northwestern Foothills, 1861-1865</field><field name="creator">Porter, Douglas R. Jr.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers Confederate disaffection and disloyalty in North Carolina?s northwestern foothills; particularly Forsyth, Stokes, Surry, Yadkin, and Wilkes Counties. In so doing, this thesis adds to a growing collection of social histories and community studies that question Southern loyalties during the Civil War, and suggest that social, religious, and political factors, as well as war weariness contributed to anti-Confederate thought and behavior. Prewar Unionism and overwhelming opposition to secession before mid-April 1861 prevented the foothill counties from wholly devoting themselves to the Confederacy. Consequently, uncommitted foothill citizens rejected the Confederacy once faced with the Richmond government?s unpopular wartime measures. Relentless hardships on the homefront additionally deepened regional dissatisfaction. In reaction, the foothill?s disaffected population viewed the Confederate national government and North Carolina?s original secessionists who encouraged the war as their primary enemies. In response, the region?s anti-Confederates disloyally rebelled against the Richmond government, North Carolina?s pro-war politicians, and the Southern war effort from April 1862 until the end of the war.</field><field name="date">2007-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03162007-173426/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of Autonomous Navigation Controllers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Using Multi-objective Genetic Programming</field><field name="creator">Barlow, Gregory John</field><field name="description">Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly popular for many applications, including search and rescue, surveillance, and electronic warfare, but almost all UAVs are controlled remotely by humans. Methods of control must be developed before UAVs can become truly autonomous. While the field of evolutionary robotics (ER) has made strides in using evolutionary computation (EC) to develop controllers for wheeled mobile robots, little attention has been paid to applying EC to UAV control. EC is an attractive method for developing UAV controllers because it allows the human designer to specify the set of high level goals that are to be solved by artificial evolution. In this research, autonomous navigation controllers were developed using multi-objective genetic programming (GP) for fixed wing UAV applications. Four behavioral fitness functions were derived from flight simulations. Multi-objective GP used these fitness functions to evolve controllers that were able to locate an electromagnetic energy source, to navigate the UAV to that source efficiently using on-board sensor measurements, and to circle around the emitter. Controllers were evolved in simulation. To narrow the gap between simulated and real controllers, the simulation environment employed noisy radar signals and a sensor model with realistic inaccuracies. All computations were performed on a 92-processor Beowulf cluster parallel computer. To gauge the success of evolution, baseline fitness values for a successful controller were established by selecting values for a minimally successful controller. Two sets of experiments were performed, the first evolving controllers directly from random initial populations, the second using incremental evolution. In each set of experiments, autonomous navigation controllers were evolved for a variety of radar types. Both the direct evolution and incremental evolution experiments were able to evolve controllers that performed acceptably. However, incremental evolution vastly increased the success rate of incremental evolution over direct evolution. The final incremental evolution experiment on the most complex radar investigated in this research evolved controllers that were able to handle all of the radar types. Evolved UAV controllers were successfully transferred to a wheeled mobile robot. An acoustic array on-board the mobile robot replaced the radar sensor, and a speaker emitting a tone was used as the target. Using the evolved navigation controllers, the mobile robot moved to the speaker and circled around it. Future research will include testing the best evolved controllers by using them to fly real UAVs.</field><field name="date">2004-03-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172004-093030/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Query Performance using Materialized XML Views: A Learning-based approach</field><field name="creator">Shah, Ashish Narendra</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a novel approach in solving the problem of improving the efficiency of query processing on an XML interface of a relational database for frequent and important queries. The motivation of this research is provided by the need to eliminate processing overheads in converting relational data to an XML format by materializing beforehand answers to frequent and important queries (which we predefine as a query workload) in terms of an XML structure. The main contribution of this paper is to show that selective materialization of data as XML views reduces query-execution costs for the workload queries, in relatively static databases. Our learning-based approach precomputes and stores (materializes) parts of the answers to the workload queries as clustered XML views. In addition, the data in the materialized XML clusters are periodically incrementally refreshed and rearranged, to respond to the changes in the query workload. We use a collection of music data as a sample database to build our learning-based system. Our experiments show that the approach can significantly reduce processing costs for frequent and important queries on relational databases with XML interfaces.</field><field name="date">2004-03-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172004-220344/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology Adoption in West Africa: adoption and disadoption of soybeans on the Togo-Benin border</field><field name="creator">Jones, Kelly Michelle</field><field name="description">New agricultural technologies are promoted in developing countries to bring about some combination of economic, environmental, and or health benefit. All of these benefits are considered to improve the livelihoods of the households that adopt them. However, the adoption of these new innovations by farm households is never uniform but is based on each household?s evaluation of the utility of the new technology with relation to that household?s attributes. This study looks at the adoption of a new agricultural crop?soybeans?that has been promoted for its nutritional effects in the Tamberma region of Benin and Togo. Variables affecting adoption and disadoption are based on five broad categories of adoption determinants found in the literature: household preferences, resource endowments, economic incentives, risk and uncertainty, and biophysical characteristics. A sixth category of farmer?s perceptions is added to this model to determine current perceptions of soybean utility in the study area. A Probit model is employed to determine factors affecting adoption and disadoption rates in the study area. Variables statistically correlated with the adoption decision include: education, extension, membership, health, cash cropping, and soil quality. Variables statistically correlated with the disadoption decision include: education, experience, expected price, and type of soil.</field><field name="date">2005-04-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172005-115144/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RATIONAL SYNTHESIS OF IMIDAZOLYL PORPHYRINIC MOLECULES FOR SELF-ASSEMBLY AND WATER-SOLUBILITY</field><field name="creator">BHAUMIK, JAYEETA</field><field name="description">The objective of this work is to develop synthetic methodology for self-assembling and water-soluble imidazole-containing porphyrinic molecules. The synthesis of the following types of compounds is described: (1) Imidazole-containing porphyrinic compounds; (2) Derivatization of the imidazolyl porphyrins to obtain water-soluble imidazolium porphyrins, and (3) Improved synthesis of tetrahydrodipyrrins - a precursor of hydroporphyrins. The self-assembly of imidazolyl metalloporphyrins was examined by UV-VIS spectroscopic analysis. Each imidazoyl metalloporphyrin was found to aggregate in non-polar solvents such as CH2Cl2. The test of water solubility was also based on absorption spectroscopy. A refined synthesis of a tetrahydrodipyrrin is described for medium-scale synthesis (&gt;10 g of the product), which facilitates access to diverse hydroporphyrins. Water-soluble porphyrinic molecules are useful for life sciences applications, and the tetrahydrodipyrrin precursors are important for the synthesis of a variety of hydroporphyrins. Taken together, this work advances the methodology for preparing a variety of synthetic porphyrins.</field><field name="date">2006-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172006-014417/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic Monitoring Relevance and Justification: Implications for Procedural Justice and Satisfaction</field><field name="creator">Watson, Aaron Michael</field><field name="description">The current study investigated whether reactions to electronic monitoring and task satisfaction are a function of the task-relatedness of monitoring practices and the presence of justification for monitoring. A sample of 176 undergraduate participants completed a computer-based task correcting electronic retail order forms. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: task-specfic monitoring with justification, task-specific monitoring without justification, off-task inclusive monitoring with justification, off-task inclusive monitoring without justification, or no monitoring. Task-specific monitoring involved electronic tracking of computer activities directly related to task performance, whereas off-task inclusive monitoring supposedly tracked nontask-related computer activities. Justification entailed providing a rationale or explanation for why monitoring was being implemented. The following dependent variables were assessed: perceived relevance of monitoring, perceived rationale for monitoring, invasion of privacy, procedural justice, and task satisfaction. Results indicated task-relatedness of monitoring and justification had an effect such that monitoring task-specific behaviors and providing a clear justification for monitoring resulted in relatively favorable attitudinal outcomes. Implications and recommendations for practice are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172008-172519/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concurrent and Sequential Surface Modification of Electrospun Polymer Micro/Nano-Fibers</field><field name="creator">Sun, Xiaoyu</field><field name="description">Surface modification of nano-fibers with bioactive functional groups has become an arresting research area in recent decades, which provides possibility for the invention of bioactive materials for textiles and biomedical applications e.g. tissue engineering. The major objective of this research is to develop a novel single-step processing route for the production of synthetic fibers possessing specific bioactive surface functionalities at nano/submicron scale. Unlike traditional sequential surface modification of nanofibers, sequence-defined oligo-peptide that carries biofunctionality was synthesized separately before incorporated onto the electrospun fibers as surface functionalities by a single-step spinning process, so as to avoid the effect from chemical synthesis on fiber processing. As one of the most widely-used technologies for the production of polymeric nanofibers, electrospinning was chosen to achieve the single-step surface modification. Conventional homopolymer in conjunction with the biofunctional oligopeptide-incorporated block copolymer were co-electrospun. Nanofibers at submicron scale with surface enrichment of block copolymer were achieved due to phase separation caused by polarizability difference under static electric field. The surface segregation of peptide block was proved by the nitrogen enrichment measured from X-ray Photoelectric Spectroscopy (XPS). The proposed mechanism is discussed based on mainly the model homopolymer system of polyethylene oxide (PEO), and extended to the ternary polymer blends composed of thermoplastic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), PEO and block copolymer. The surface modification technique introduced deep insight into the electrospinning process with its effect to the polymer blends microphase separation, and leads to a promising perspective for biomaterial engineers to produce nanofibers with certain surface bio-functional groups.</field><field name="date">2008-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172008-185615/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Final Day in the City</field><field name="creator">Reade, Daniel Harold</field><field name="description">A Final Day in the City is a novel which covers a day in the lives of Lucy Weathers, a high school history teacher in Seattle, Washington, and Dix, a member of a mysterious group of individuals who are given extreme powers and charged with killing various people, people who are seemingly chosen at random by an unknown higher power.

For elementary school teachers, helping students become proficient readers is one of the greatest impacts they can make in a student&#226;s academic career. It is essential that students receive reading strategies in the classroom that have strong research support. Instructional strategies that have been shown to improve reading fluency include: repeated reading, listening passage preview, and phrase drill. Through the use of such evidence-based, procedurally standardized intervention strategies, teachers may be able to make meaningful contributions to improve students&#226; reading fluency. This study was conducted in an effort to bridge research to practice by offering an example of effectiveness (versus efficacy) research on a multi-component, evidence-based reading fluency intervention referred the Helping Early Literacy with Practice Strategies (HELPS) Program. The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the HELPS Program with low-performing second grade students when implemented by four classroom teachers and teacher assistants in a minimally controlled setting. Results from the study suggested that 29 students who received HELPS significantly improved (from pre-test to post-test) on the measure of basic reading competence when compared to a control group of 30 students, with low-performing students who received HELPS making significantly larger reading gains than students who did not receive the program. In addition, the study demonstrated that such outcomes are achievable when teachers and teacher assistants implement the program. Given these findings, HELPS appears to be a useful and practical tool for educators&#226; use in elementary school settings.</field><field name="date">2010-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172010-155104/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution of Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide to Carbon Nanotube- and Vanadium Pentoxide-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Rats</field><field name="creator">Cesta, Mark Francis</field><field name="description">Pulmonary fibrosis is typically accompanied by inflammation, which is thought to play a role in its pathogenesis, and occurs with occupational exposure to particulates and metals, such as asbestos and vanadium pentoxide (V2O5). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model of acute lung injury and inflammation, chronic bronchitis, and pulmonary fibrosis, upregulates platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R&#206;&#177;) in rat lung fibroblasts (RLF). PDGF, a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for mesenchymal cells, is an important mediator in fibrotic lung diseases. This dissertation examines the effects of pre-existing inflammation, induced by LPS, on carbon nanotube (CNT)- and V2O5-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats and the involvement of PDGF signaling. Rats were pretreated with 2.5 mg/kg LPS by intranasal aspiration, followed 24 hr later by 4 mg /kg CNT, carbon black (CB), or V2O5 administered by intratracheal instillation. Total and differential cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, and PDGF and transforming growth factor-&#206;&#178; (TGF-&#206;&#178;) protein levels (by ELISA) were examined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of control and CB- and MWCNT &#226;exposed rats. Lungs from all animals were collected for histopathological analysis, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR of the Pdgf-a, Pdgf-c, Pdgf-r&#206;&#177;, and Tgf-&#206;&#178; genes. Pdgf-a, Pdgf-c, Pdgf-r&#206;&#177;, Tgf-&#206;&#178;, and Col1a2 gene expression was also measured in vitro in RLF and NR8383 rat alveolar macrophages in response to CNT or CB with and without LPS. In vivo, CNT and CB caused fibroproliferative, granulomatous lesions, which were located primarily in the alveolar ducts and alveoli. Pretreatment with LPS significantly increased collagen deposition associated with these lesions. In the BAL fluid, LPS pretreatment lead to increases in LDH, total protein, and PDGF-AA protein in rats exposed to MWCNT, and an increase in inflammatory cells in CB-exposed rats compared to controls. In vitro, LPS stimulated Pdgf-r&#206;&#177; gene expression in RLF, and LPS and nanoparticles synergistically increased Pdgf-a expression in NR8383 cells. Combined LPS/V2O5 exposure augmented V2O5-induced pulmonary inflammation, airway epithelial necrosis, and fibrosis and amplified in vivo collagen gene expression. The airway lesions were of particular interest because LPS pretreatment increased the incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans-like lesions, including subepithelial fibrosis and intraluminal fibrotic polyps. These data confirm that LPS pretreatment augments the fibrotic effects of CNT and V2O5 in rats, which likely involves enhanced PDGF signaling. This dissertation provides evidence that pre-existing pulmonary inflammation, as occurs with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases or cigarette smoking, can enhance pulmonary fibrotic responses to environmental agents. Furthermore, exposure to environmental LPS may play a role in the pathogenesis of some fibrotic lung diseases.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03172010-173120/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ALL OF MY WORDS: CREATING ISLAMIC FEMALE IDENTITY THROUGH IRANIAN LITERATURE AND FILM</field><field name="creator">Crowder, Melissa Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the state of Islamic feminism in Iran through Iranian fiction and film and supporting Islamic texts.

It is located above the heart and is made up of two compartments, the thymic epithelial space and the perivascular space. The thymic epithelial space consists of the cortex and the medulla, which is where T cell development, maturation and induction of self tolerance occur in a process known as thymopoiesis. The thymus is susceptible to chronic and acute stressors that result in thymic involution. A consequence of thymic involution is reduced thymopoiesis, which affects the generation of a diverse T cell repertoire and establishment of central T cell tolerance. Many thymosuppressive and thymostimulatory cytokines are involved in thymopoiesis and thymic involution. Keratinocyte growth factor and IL-7 are two cytokines that function in driving early thymic progenitor proliferation and T cell development, respectively. We hypothesized that IL-7 and Keratinocyte growth factor, delivered via recombinant adenovirus, can improve thymopoiesis and T cell reconstitution in mice in an endotoxin model of acute thymic atrophy. Analysis of thymus weight, cellularity, phenotype and TCR gene rearrangement showed moderate increases in thymic function with delivery of IL-7 or Keratinocyte growth factor versus control. Taken together, these data suggested that IL-7 and Keratinocyte growth factor, delivered via recombinant adenoviruses, have thymostimulatory effects on the thymus in normal thymus or settings of acute thymic atrophy and maybe beneficial for future development as therapeutics.</field><field name="date">2008-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03182008-100350/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Reference-Mark Density and Saliency on Time-To-Passage</field><field name="creator">Ornan, Rachelle Nitzanne</field><field name="description">Gogel &amp; McNulty (1983) demonstrated that the greater the density of vertical reference or hatch marks in a display, the greater the perceived velocity of a laterally moving object. Their study corroborates the findings of other researchers that the addition of reference-marks or a reference frame lowers the motion threshold (Liebowitz, 1955; Brown, 1931a, 1931b). The current study&#226;s first experiment successfully replicated the results of Gogel &amp; McNulty&#226;s study using a flat panel LCD screen and a predicted-motion task. Subsequent experiments examined the effect of object and reference-mark characteristics on accuracy. In general, accuracy increased as the extrapolation distance (ED) and reference-mark density increased. There was a consistent interactive effect between ED and reference-mark density such that medium and long EDs coupled with high density of reference-marks produced the greatest increase in accuracy. There was an interactive sex effect with ED which was present in the results, but was not consistent. Though accuracy was not affected by object size, horizontal extent, shape, familiarity, color or offset, the effect of high reference-mark density on improving accuracy disappeared when marks were less salient. The results of these experiments have application to the design of displays used for military, air traffic control and cockpit applications, laparoscopic surgery, assembly-line manufacturing, highway-construction tasks, and on-orbit space manufacturing and construction.</field><field name="date">2008-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03182008-142636/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the Intersection of Gender, Race and Class: A Study of African American Women Presidents at Four-Year Colleges and Universities</field><field name="creator">Wright , Gwendolyn</field><field name="description">This study identified that African American women presidents have been disproportionately underrepresented in leadership positions in higher education due to a historical and contemporary system of hegemony within higher education that has limited their access to positions of power.

It is used to statistically integrate the findings of many studies to come to generalizable conclusions. Unfortunately, in some cases, the number of studies available for the analysis can make the meta-analysis process extremely difficult and lengthy. The current study attempted to alleviate this problem by investigating the effects of random sampling of the studies used in the analysis in recently published meta-analyses to determine if a subsample of studies could produce accurate results. In the process, the characteristics of recent meta-analyses were investigated, as well as the percentage of randomly sampled studies that is needed to produce accurate moderator findings. Results of this investigation provide preliminary support for the use of random sampling in medium and large-scale meta-analyses, or analyses in which a medium (35 or more) to large number (91 or more) of studies fit the analyst&#226;s inclusion criteria. Random sampling was able to reproduce the main effect sizes found in these types of meta-analyses. The use of random sampling to replicate the results of meta-analyses involving moderators, however, was only successful in large scale analyses. It is hoped that these results will encourage the use of random sampling in future meta-analyses by providing guidelines for its use, as this procedure can drastically reduce the amount of work required.</field><field name="date">2008-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03182008-184923/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why Bother Blogging? Motivations for Adults in the United States to Maintain a Personal Journal Blog.</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Heather Marie</field><field name="description">A blog is an online journal that is updated regularly and usually maintained by a single author. Roughly 8 to 9 percent of adult Internet users in the U.S. maintain a blog, which is about 12 million people. This study examines the most prevalent motivations for adults in the U.S. to maintain a specific type of blog &#226; the personal journal blog. The personal journal blog is defined as a blog maintained by one person and containing mostly personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. An online survey of 127 personal journal bloggers who updated their blog at least every 4-5 days was conducted in December 2007 and January 2008. Participants in the survey represented a wide range of ages, geographical locations, and educational achievement levels, with most being 25 &#226; 44 years old, female, White, and having at least some college education. Results indicate that the two most prevalent motivations for adults in the U.S. to maintain a personal journal blog are: (a) to entertain oneself and (b) to clarify thoughts and/or emotions. Survey participants also responded to questions regarding their feelings about blogging.

Solutes such as Y, W, Ta, Ni and Zr were selected based on their propensity to grain boundary segregated in Fe. Based on preliminary heat treatments Zr was selected as the solute of choice. Upon further heat treating experiments and microstructural analysis it was found that Zr solute additions of &lt; 4at% could stabilize a nanocrystalline microstructure of &lt;100nm at temperatures in excess of 900oC. This is in stark comparison to pure nanocrystalline Fe which shows coarsening to the micron scale after annealing above 600oC. Reduction in grain boundary energy due to Zr segregation and solute drag are proposed as mechanism responsible for the observed thermal stability.</field><field name="date">2009-03-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03182009-141051/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Discontinuous Reaction Functions</field><field name="creator">He, Taiping</field><field name="description">This dissertation studies coupled reaction diffusion systems with discontinuous reaction functions. It includes three parts: The first part is concerned with the existence of solutions for a coupled system of two parabolic equations and the second part is devoted to the monotone iterative methods for monotone and mixed quasimonotone functions. Various monotone iterative schemes are presented and each of these schemes leads to an existence-comparison theorem and the monotone convergence of the maximal and minimal sequences. In the third part, the monotone iterative schemes are applied to compute numerical solutions of the system. These numerical solutions are based on the finite element method which gives a finite approximation of the coupled system. Numerical results for some scalar parabolic bounday problems and a coupled system of parabolic equations are also given.</field><field name="date">2005-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192005-101102/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IDENTIFYING QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI (QTLs) FOR FUMONISIN ACCUMULATION AND EAR ROT RESISTANCE IN MAIZE (Zea mays L.)</field><field name="creator">Robertson-Hoyt, Leilani Ann</field><field name="description">Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum are fungal pathogens of maize that cause ear rot and contaminate maize with fumonisin. The first objective was to investigate the relationship between Fusarium ear rot and fumonisin contamination. Two populations, BC1F1:2 families created from the cross of GE440 &#215; FR1064 (GEFR population) and recombinant inbred lines created from the cross of NC300 &#215; B104 (NCB population) were studied. Moderate to high heritabilities and strong genetic correlations between ear rot and fumonisin concentration were estimated and suggest that selection for reduced ear rot should frequently identify low fumonisin lines. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was then used to study genetic relationships between the two traits and to investigate consistency of QTL across populations. Eight QTL in the GEFR population and five QTL in the NCB population affected both traits. At least three ear rot and two fumonisin contamination QTL mapped to similar positions in the two populations. Two QTL appeared to be consistent for both traits across both populations. To investigate the relationship between resistance and agronomic utility in the GEFR population, yield and agronomic performance were measured in line testcrosses. Correlation and QTL analyses were employed to study these relationships. QTLs identified included 7 yield, 5 grain moisture, 8 plant height, 6 ear height, 3 silk date, and 4 tassel date QTLs. If backcrossing were utilized to move resistance alleles into the FR1064 background, our results suggest that correlated responses would include an increase in grain moisture and decrease in stalk lodging. However, marker-assisted selection may facilitate breaking linkages between resistance alleles and alleles reducing agronomic performance. The second objective was to investigate the resistances to Fusarium and Aspergillus ear rots and fumonisin and aflatoxin contamination in selected lines. Based on the NCB study, the 24 highest and 24 lowest mean fumonisin concentration lines were selected. The low fumonisin group had significantly lower levels of both mycotoxins and ear rots. All four traits were significantly correlated, suggesting that at least some of the genes involved in resistance to ear rots and mycotoxin contamination by these fungal species are identical or genetically linked.</field><field name="date">2006-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192006-171605/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the Empirical Status of Akers? Social Learning Theory: A Review of Literature on Human Reinforcement Learning</field><field name="creator">Brauer, Jonathan Richard</field><field name="description">Proponents of social learning theory suggest that decades of empirical criminological research have validated the core propositions of social learning theory, and that future efforts should be directed toward further theoretical elaboration and integration (see Akers 1998; Akers and Jensen 2006). In response, some critics have suggested that empirical research has failed to isolate the causal mechanisms underlying the correlates of crime and deviance, and, as a result, existing ?data are seemingly consistent with several theories at once? (Sampson 1999:443). In this paper, I outline the causal importance of differential reinforcement in Akers? social learning theory, and I provide a systematic review of a sample of psychological and criminological literature on human reinforcement learning in an attempt to evaluate the current empirical status of Akers? social learning theory. I find that the empirical evidence supporting human reinforcement learning processes found in the behavioral psychology literature may not be directly generalizable to social learning theory, and that measurement difficulties have led criminology researchers to use indirect measures or to simply leave the concept of differential reinforcement out of empirical analyses altogether. As a result, many of social learning theory?s hypothesized causal linkages remain unexamined. I conclude that future research should be directed toward testing social learning theory?s central hypotheses regarding differential reinforcement before moving on to expand and test the theory?s macro-level implications.</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192007-124842/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personalized Hierarchical Menu Organization for Mobile Device Users</field><field name="creator">Dawkins, Andrea Lauren</field><field name="description">As Internet access via cell phone browsers becomes more common, new website interfaces are emerging. Hierarchical menus are effective for such interfaces due to their compact presentation. For menus with many levels and possible destinations, personalized menu organizations can potentially expedite navigation. This thesis contains an empirical and analytical evaluation of two menu personalization techniques based on user preferences, Expanded menus and Expanded/Reordered menus. A 30 participant experiment revealed that both types of personalized menus resulted in faster performance and higher evaluations from the users, with the Expanded/Reordered menu ranking the highest in both respects. One interesting finding was that individual users' evaluation was not consistent with their performance. Data collected from the performance study was used to evaluate an existing GOMS model of cell phone menu traversal, which demonstrated significant limitations in the generality of the model. However, the results also suggest that individual differences in user performance may account for much of the error in model predictions.</field><field name="date">2007-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192007-152209/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality Type (MBTI) Relationship to Performance and Satisfaction in Web-based Instruction (WBI)</field><field name="creator">Lucas, Debra Jan Willis</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to provide empirical data that reports the association between students? personality type preferences as understood by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality profile and their achievement and perception of satisfaction in web-based learning environments. Data were collected from two graduate level courses offered entirely online using the WebCT learning management system during one semester. The data of interest were extracted from the course information; MBTI profile (learning style), numeric end of course grade (performance), course evaluation (used for satisfaction indicator). The demographic subject profile information such as gender, ethnicity, and age were extracted from the MBTI profile database collection. Data analysis and generation were done using SAS software. For the given sample, the data show the MBTI scale preference for Thinking-Feeling make a statistically significant difference in the satisfaction ratings of Learner-to-Learner and Learner-to-Content interactions within Web-based instructed (WBI) courses. Students with MBTI preference for Feeling rated their satisfaction with Learner-to-Learner and Learner-to-Content interactions in the WBI courses higher than those with Thinking preference. Satisfaction with Learner-to-Instructor interaction was not related to MBTI preference, but was statistically significantly different by age range. MBTI preference, age and gender did not make a difference in achievement as measured by end of course grade in the WBI courses. These findings suggests Web-based instruction should ensure effective methods and strategies are used to accommodate student learning preference with regard to course interactions.</field><field name="date">2007-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum and Instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192007-153855/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inventory Optimization in a One Product Recoverable Manufacturing System</field><field name="creator">Ahiska, Semra Sebnem</field><field name="description">Environmental regulations or the necessity for a green image due to growing environmental concerns as well as the potential economical benefits of product recovery have pushed manufacturers to integrate product recovery management with their manufacturing process. Consequently, production planning and inventory control of recoverable manufacturing systems has gained significant interest among researchers who aim to contribute to industrial practice. This dissertation considers inventory optimization of a single product recoverable manufacturing system where stochastic demand is met by either newly manufactured items or remanufactured items. Lead times and set up costs for manufacturing and remanufacturing are considered. The inventory optimization problem for this system is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and through an empirical study, optimal or near-optimal policy characterizations under several cost configurations and several lead time cases for manufacturing and remanufacturing are determined. The effects of a change in cost parameters of the system on the optimal policy structure as well as policy parameter values are investigated. Results indicate that the existence of set up cost for either manufacturing or remanufacturing has a significant effect on policy structure. Consequently, an MDP-based search procedure is introduced to determine the inventory policy characterizations given that appropriate policy structures under certain cost configurations are known. Further, a neural network analysis is performed to determine the functional relationships between cost parameters of the system and the inventory policy parameter values. Results indicate that the policy characterizations found by either MDP-based search methodology or the formulae provided by neural network are optimal or near-optimal with small deviations (usually, less than 1%) from optimal cost. Finally, the optimal inventory policies are investigated through the entire product life cycle of a remanufacturable product. Benefiting from the MDP analysis, the optimal or near-optimal policy characterizations with only a few parameters are determined for every stage of the product life cycle. The effects of a change in the demand and return rates on the optimal inventory policies are investigated. Further, the performance of these long-run policy characterizations is evaluated in a finite-horizon setting, and the importance of frequently revising the inventory policies over the product life cycle is illustrated numerically.</field><field name="date">2008-03-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192008-154625/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collector</field><field name="creator">Spring, Mark Jeremy</field><field name="description">This thesis is a collection of original poems written to fulfill the MFA thesis requirement.</field><field name="date">2009-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192009-125346/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientific Basis vs. Contextualized Application of Knowledge: The Effect of Teaching Methodology on the Achievement of Post-secondary Students in an Integrated Agricultural Biotechnology Course</field><field name="creator">Curry, Kevin Wylie Jr</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to compare two teaching methodologies for an integrated agricultural biotechnology course at the postsecondary level. The two teaching methods tested were the explanation of the scientific basis for content (comparison treatment) versus the application of content to a real world agricultural context (experimental treatment). The study was implemented with two different classes over two semesters. The comparison treatment was administered to 22 students during the spring semester of 2009, and the experimental treatment was administered to 16 students during the fall semester of 2009. The research design used was a quasi-experimental non-equivalent control-group design with an identical pre/posttest given to each group as a means of assessing content achievement. Although the experimental treatment, based out of the principles of contextual teaching and learning, did have a greater mean gain on the pre/posttest it was not statistically significant (p &gt;.05), so the study&#226;s null hypothesis was not rejected. Based on these results, compared with traditional methods, a curriculum of contextualized teaching and learning can be implemented while maintaining a comparable level of student achievement.</field><field name="date">2010-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03192010-113431/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived Needs of Lateral Entry Teachers: A Case Study of Three Initially Licensed Science Teachers</field><field name="creator">Smith, Ralph C</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceived needs of initially licensed Lateral Entry science teachers to acquire an understanding of how university courses and mentoring programs can better meet their needs.

As observed with atomic force microscopy (AFM), AlN initially grew in the form of flat-topped islands on as-received SiC substrates. Threading dislocations (TDs) observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images initiated at the AlN/SiC interface as the result of defects at the surface of the mechanically polished substrate and/or condensation of point defects. GaN initially grew in the Stranski-Krastanov mode on AlN/SiC before transitioning to the dislocation-mediated step flow mode. The TDs in GaN resulted from the propagation of the TDs present in the AlN layer. The biaxial strain in the GaN layers varied with buffer layer material and layer thickness yet all samples investigated remained in residual compression due to incomplete relaxation of the coherent strain. The presence of strain during the initial growth of Al&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;N layers directly on as-received SiC also resulted in phase-separated regions of Al-rich and Al-poor film. A high temperature hydrogen etch was then used to remove mechanical polishing scratches from the SiC substrates. Subsequently deposited AlN layers featured reduced pit density and the elimination of scratch-induced undulations. GaN layers deposited with AlN buffer layers on these substrates resulted in slightly reduced TD densities as observed by AFM, TEM, and high resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD). Regions of dramatically reduced dislocation densities were observed by HRXRD, TEM, and cathodoluminescence for GaN layers on stripe-patterned Si substrates. However, long growth times resulted in outdiffusion of Si from the substrate and subsequent film roughening. Finally, it was demonstrated that the presence of ammonia during heating of GaN templates to the growth temperature for homoepitaxy resulted in removal of carbon- and oxygen-based contaminants from the template surface.</field><field name="date">2005-03-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202005-194018/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Noncognitive Variables Predicting Academic Success and Persistence for African-American Freshmen Attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities versus African-American Freshmen Attending Predominantly White Institutions</field><field name="creator">Stretch, LoriAnn Sykes</field><field name="description">Limited research is available when attempting to determine what, if any, differences exist in predicting academic success and persistence for African-American students attending a historically Black college or university (HBCU) versus a predominantly White institution (PWI). Tracey and Sedlacek?s (1984) noncognitive variables have accurately predicted academic success and persistence for African-American students. However, in this study, the majority of the noncognitive variables as measured by the NCQ did not differ significantly between the PWI (n=58) and the HBCU (n=538). The interaction term of Positive Self-Concept and institution type did differ for academic success and was more significant at the PWI than the HBCU. Similarly, Knowledge Acquired in a Field and Successful Leadership Positions differed for college persistence between the two institution types and was more significant at the PWI than the HBCU. Although the majority of noncognitive variables did not assist in determining the second semester GPA or enrollment status of African-American students at either a PWI or a HBCU, past research has clearly demonstrated that the significance of noncognitive variables differs from semester to semester. Therefore, a more comprehensive longitudinal study examining multiple PWIs and HBCUs is needed to fully understand what, if any, differences there are in the way noncognitive or psychosocial variables predict academic success and persistence at a PWI versus a HBCU.</field><field name="date">2005-04-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counselor Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202005-220853/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Examination of Indivdiual Differences Among Abused Children Using Cluster Analysis</field><field name="creator">Sabourin Ward, Caryn</field><field name="description">Investigations historically have been designed to identify the ways in which abused children differ from their nonabused peers. Although those studies have been instrumental in increasing the understanding of typical sequela of child abuse, past research has not informed us about differences that might exist within groups of abused children. The purpose of the current study was to examine individual differences in social adjustment among physically abused children using cluster analysis, a strategy based on a person-oriented approach to understanding individual differences. Participants were 98 children and their parents. All of the children had a substantiated history of physical abuse. Children?s problem solving skills and intent attributions were evaluated using hypothetical vignettes. In addition, parents and children participated in a 30-minute play session that was videotaped for later coding of parent behavior. Approximately six months after the clinic assessment, each child was observed during unstructured play and teachers completed the Social Behavior Scale (SBS) to describe the child?s adjustment. Cluster analyses were conducted on seven variables derived from the sample of playground behavior and the SBS. Using a number of criteria, support was found to extract three clusters. The ?Social Difficulties? cluster was comprised of children who received the highest ratings for social maladjustment and the lowest for prosocial behavior. The ?Socially Well Adjusted? subgroup was compromised of children who received the highest teacher ratings for prosocial behavior and the lowest for social maladjustment. Children comprising the ?At Risk? cluster were moderately well adjusted in social behavior; their scores were between those of the other clusters. A secondary purpose of the proposed research was to examine whether intellectual functioning, attributions of intent, social problem solving skills, and/or parental warmth predicted cluster membership. Only hostile attributions of intent was found to be a significant predictor of cluster membership. Findings support our assertion that there are clinically-relevant subgroups among children who have experienced abuse. Although these findings should be considered preliminary pending replication, they do point to the potential utility of examining individual differences in functioning among samples of abused children.</field><field name="date">2006-05-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202006-221351/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Air Around a Dead Man</field><field name="creator">Cross, Samuel</field><field name="description">"The Air Around a Dead Man" is a collection of poetry.</field><field name="date">2007-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202007-192557/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Team Climate on Substance Use Behaviors, Perceptions, and Attitudes of Student-Athletes at a Large, Public University in the Southeast</field><field name="creator">Tomon, Jennifer Eileen</field><field name="description">Prior research shows that college student-athletes experience higher rates of substance use than their non-athlete peers. Studies have also shown that variation in substance use exists on the basis of sport/team affiliation. This study seeks to determine the influence of team climate on the differences in substance use behaviors, perceptions, and attitudes among athletic teams. The first part of this thesis includes a review of the literature on the prevalence of substance use among college student-athletes as well as the theoretical approaches most relevant to a study of social networks and the effects on substance use. The literature review is followed by the results and discussion of a study conducted with a sample of 188 student-athletes at a large, public university in the southeastern United States. Analysis of the results of the Student-Athlete Team Climate and Substance Use Survey (SATCSUS) showed that that team climates of the participants&#226; athletic teams related to the substance use behaviors and perceptions of the student-athletes but not to their attitudes toward substance use. Several demographic variables were also shown to be related to the substance use behaviors, perceptions, and attitudes of the student-athletes.

People with GSD Ia lack the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). As a result, these people are unable to convert liver glycogen to free glucose and develop severe hypoglycemia. Patients with GSD also develop growth retardation, hepatomegaly, renomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlactacidemia. No cure for GSD Ia currently exists. Patients are treated symptomatically with repeated naso-gastric feedings and glucose infusions to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations. Despite treatment, the underlying enzymatic defect remains. Gene therapy holds the promise of correcting this metabolic defect, thus providing a true cure for GSD Ia. Gene therapy uses modified virus particles to deliver a replacement functional G6Pase gene to the patient&#226;s liver. Our group is using two viral vectors, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd), for gene therapy in dogs with an inheritable form of GSD Ia. We have treated three GSD Ia dogs with the AAV vector and two GSD Ia dogs with the HDAd vector. Vector-treated dogs were able to maintain normal blood glucose concentrations and unlike their untreated counterparts, survived for several years. These promising results provide hope that gene therapy may emerge as an effective treatment for people with GSD Ia.</field><field name="date">2009-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202009-163526/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthropogenic Drivers of Gypsy Moth Dispersal.</field><field name="creator">Bigsby, Kevin M</field><field name="description">Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar: Linnaeus) is a polyphagous non-native forest pest first introduced to Medford, Massachusetts in 1869. It has since spread as far south as North Carolina and as far west as Wisconsin. Gypsy moth is responsible for defoliating approximately 100,000 hectares of forest annually, resulting in mortality in a small percentage of trees, averting behavior by recreators, and creating a nuisance to the general public. Limiting the spread of gypsy moth is beneficial because it delays the onset of costs and losses associated with quarantine, tree defoliation and mortality, and nuisance. Gypsy moth is believed to disperse naturally up to 2.5 km/yr (e.g. early instar ballooning) but has been observed to disperse much greater distances. The scientific consensus is that this longer distance dispersal occurs through anthropogenic vectors (e.g. egg masses being transported on firewood). Despite the resources that United States Department of Agriculture and state agencies dedicate to eliminating and managing new infestations resulting from long distance dispersal, there has been limited empirical research on the relationship between the dispersal of gypsy moth and the movement of people and their goods. This thesis develops a conceptual framework of the anthropogenic factors that could affect dispersal, measures these factors with secondary data at the county level from a variety of sources, and estimates the presence or absence of gypsy moth using logistic regression models. The dependent variable is drawn from trap catch records archived by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service program, Slow-the-Spread, in areas distal to the 1 moth/trap line between 1999 and 2007. Through step-wise logistic regression estimating sub-models that include variables representing each broad anthropogenic factor, a final empirical model is specified. The variables of the model are estimated independently for each year from 1999 to 2007, resulting in a mean Pseudo R square of 0.568. Consistently significant ( ) anthropogenic variables are the number of households using wood for heating fuel and mean household income. These findings are discussed with regard to invasion theory and quarantine policy. One key implication is the continual importance of regulating and raising awareness about the risk of moving firewood from infested to uninfested zones.</field><field name="date">2009-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202009-173827/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living in Sin, In Sickness and In Health? An Investigation of Cohabitation, Marriage, and Health</field><field name="creator">Marks, Jennifer</field><field name="description">The physical and psychological health benefits of marriage have been well-documented in the family and medical sociology literature. Given the recent increases in the prevalence of cohabitation, this research asks whether marriage still confers the same health benefits, and whether cohabitation might do the same. Using two waves of a nationally representative sample, the effects of union type on eleven health outcomes were examined, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally; processual factors such as social support, health behaviors, and socioeconomic status were also examined. Union type was not a consistent predictor of health outcomes: spouses appear somewhat better off than singles, but major differences between cohabitation and marriage were not found. Further, the health benefits of marriage are primarily afforded to men, and the benefits of both union types are more pronounced for younger persons. Social support was a consistent and positive predictor of physical and psychological health, although men may receive greater benefits than women. Health behavior measures were not effective predictors of health outcomes, but this may be due to measurement issues. Socioeconomic status measures were also consistent predictors of physical and psychological health, although an individual&#226;s employment was more often significant than total household income. Additional analyses were conducted to test the &#226;selection hypothesis&#226; &#226; that healthier people are more likely to enter unions. Results are supportive of selective effects for marriage, but not nearly as much so for cohabitation, implying that perhaps different mate selection processes are at work for the two union types. Theoretical, research, and policy implications are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03202009-175559/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Impact of the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid on Residential Property Values.</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is an exotic insect pest that has been causing mortality to eastern and Carolina hemlocks. The HWA is currently established in 15 eastern states and is spreading to other states where these hemlock species are found. Hemlocks are an important natural and cultural resource on many public lands throughout their range, and are widely used as ornamental trees in residential landscapes. To date, the economic impact of the historic and potential future spread of the HWA on private residential property values, has not been quantified. As the eastern hemlock is a commonly planted species in residential landscapes, valued both for it?s aesthetic beauty and screening purposes, it is hypothesized that hemlock health on an individual?s private property will affect that home?s value. Furthermore, it is theorized that hemlocks in the area surrounding an individual house are considered neighborhood amenities and will also contribute to residential property values. This research examines the economic impact of HWA on residential landscapes. &lt;br&gt;A limited number of studies have been conducted to estimate the non-market economic impacts associated with forest insect pests. Most of these studies used contingent valuation methods, asking people to state their maximum willingness to pay for specific forest protection programs. Hedonic property value models can also be used to assess the economic impact of a forest pest by estimating how the value of trees is capitalized into private property values. As far as the author is aware, there has only been one published study to use the hedonic pricing method to estimate economic impacts from forest insect pests. &lt;br&gt; In this study, the linkage between residential property values and HWA infestation is investigated by employing a hedonic model. Northwestern New Jersey was chosen for the study site as the HWA has already had a significant impact in this area. In addition to structural housing characteristics, environmental variables used in the model include measures of hemlock health resulting from the HWA infestation, types of land cover, proximity to natural areas and the presence of water bodies. Previously interpreted Landsat satellite imagery data, measuring hemlock health on a landscape scale over the past 20 years, was the source for the hemlock variables used in this research. &lt;br&gt;The analysis for this study spans multiple spatial scales in order to examine both immediate parcel level and larger scale neighborhood effects of hemlock health on the value of homes. Spatial econometric techniques were employed to correct for the spatial dependence found in the data. A general spatial model employing both spatial error and spatial lag terms, with a semi-log functional form was used as the final specification. The results indicate statistically significant signs on hemlock health variables that correspond with the postulation. In the first study area, healthy hemlocks had a positive effect on property values at all spatial scales, while moderately defoliated hemlocks had a negative impact on housing prices. In the second study area, healthy hemlocks contributed positively to housing prices, but only in the larger spatial scale. Dead hemlocks were found to have a negative effect, but were only significant at the parcel level. &lt;br&gt;Invasive species in this country pose an increasing threat to our natural resources, and their impact needs to be quantified from both an ecological and economic standpoint. This study is innovative, combining the work of landscape ecologists and environmental economists, and extending the application of satellite imagery data in examining natural resource management issues. The assessment of the economic impacts of HWA on residential landscapes will also be useful to forest managers and policy makers concerned with resource allocation decisions concerning investments in forest pest management. &lt;br&gt;</field><field name="date">2005-04-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212005-232828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Work Context on the Prediction of Job Performance</field><field name="creator">Poncheri, Reanna Maureen</field><field name="description">Although it is widely accepted that individual behavior is determined by person and situation characteristics, much research in the domain of job performance focuses more on person variables, while focusing less on the role of the work context.

Particularly, carbon-based nanomaterials such as fullerenes, nanotubes, and nanowires are considered key elements in the development of new nano-applications with the potential to be used in everything from biomedicine and drug delivery systems to nanoelectronics and energy conservation mechanisms. Relatively unknown, however, is how exposure to nanoscale particles effects normal biological functions and processes. A major focus of recent toxicological research has begun to investigate the interactions between the biological environment and engineered nanoparticles and to determine appropriate safety standards that should be considered when interacting with nanomaterials. The purpose of this research is to investigate how fullerene-based amino acids interact with the biological environment both at the tissue and cellular levels and to identify factors, such as mechanical stimulation, that increase these interactions.</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212007-144330/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Capacity Heat Exchangers for Recirculating 18F Radionuclide Production Targets</field><field name="creator">Newnam, Robert Pruett</field><field name="description">North Carolina State University in conjunction with Bruce Technologies Inc. is developing recirculating water targets for the cyclotron production of high yields of 18F fluoride for PET radiopharmaceuticals. Flourine-18 is commonly produced through proton irradiation of 18O enriched water by the 18O(p,n)18F reaction. Heat deposited in the target fluid by the proton beam is proportional to the 18F produced, thus production is often limited by the targets ability to reject heat. For power levels above 3 kW, boiling batch targets with local cooling can become impractical due to excessive 18O water volumes. One potential solution is a recirculating target system where the target water velocity is sufficient to prevent boiling. In this design the heated fluid travels through an external heat exchanger of sufficient capacity to remove the heat, and then through a pump which returns the cooled fluid to the target. A high-flow/low-volume pump and a high-capacity/low-volume heat exchanger are essential to the overall performance of the recirculating target. In this work, two different types of heat exchangers are considered. Laboratory testing was conducted on a small shell and tube heat exchanger that removed nearly 6 kW of heat at flows provided by a miniature regenerative turbine pump. Laboratory testing was also conducted on a small cross flow heat exchanger with measured performance of 7.4 kW and predicted peak performance approaching 10 kW.</field><field name="date">2007-03-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212007-150136/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James Lawson: Leading Architect and Educator of Nonviolence and Nonviolent Direct Action Protest Strategies During the Student Sit-in Movement of 1960.</field><field name="creator">McDuffie, Scott Patterson</field><field name="description">James Morris Lawson, Jr. grew up in Massillion, Ohio, in a loving Christian home. He became a pacifist at an early age after a memorable encounter with racism. As he matured, he studied nonviolence from the perspectives of Jesus Christ and the great Indian revolutionary, Mohandas Gandhi. After meeting the famous Christian pacifist, A. J. Muste, Lawson became a member of the Fellowship of Reconciliation and a conscientious objector to war. He spent fourteen months in a federal prison after refusing to be drafted into the U.S. military. After prison, Lawson worked in India as a missionary and learned nonviolent direct action strategies from Gandhi?s followers.Inspired by the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Lawson left India and returned to America in 1956 to join the struggle to end racial segregation in America. That same year, Lawson met Martin Luther King, Jr. and upon King?s request, moved to the South to teach nonviolence. Lawson eventually settled in Nashville, Tennessee, to teach nonviolence to a group of young men and women who would become some of the most important ?leaders? in the American Civil Rights Movement. James Lawson made a significant contribution to the student sit-in movement of 1960 by teaching a new idea?nonviolent direct action?to an elite group of student activists. However, his influence has been ignored by most histories of the movement. The following essay brings this elusive figure to the forefront and highlights his impact on the first wave of student activists who spearheaded the nonviolent campaign to overturn segregation.</field><field name="date">2007-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212007-153100/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evolution of Nancy Drew, Cultural Icon: Readers, Writers, and Fanfiction Authors</field><field name="creator">Merrill, Ashley</field><field name="description">Nancy Drew is widely recognized as an influential American cultural icon. In this paper I make a detailed examination of Nancy's initial characterization as girl sleuth in the first ten books of the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, published in the 1930s. I spend another chapter examining the initial volumes of later Nancy Drew series books, specifically the 1960s rewritten texts, the 1980s-90s Nancy Drew Files series, and the contemporary Girl Detective series. My penultimate chapter discusses Nancy Drew as realized in fanfiction, or stories written by readers and fans. My emphasis is on explaining Nancy's appeal as a cultural icon and the ways fanfiction authors reinvent and appropriate that icon for their own purposes in stories. To this end I cite fanfic writers and readers' response to why they read and write Nancy Drew fanfiction, and I analyze the content and function of a sample of stories written by Nancy Drew fans. I conclude that Nancy's appeal and the basis of her status as cultural icon is due to her unique nature as a figure frozen in transition between adolescence and adulthood, along with her more conventionally admirable traits. Her Everygirl appearance when removed from that unique matrix makes her extremely adaptable to readers for their own purposes, both within the context of fanfiction and without.</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212007-201056/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrative Medical Practice: A Proposed System for Women's Healthcare</field><field name="creator">Powers, Brook Marie</field><field name="description">Female health is a complex and dynamic component of the female lifecycle.

The shortcoming of this method, as discussed in detail, is that the inference rules applied may be wrong. In fact, little path flow research has addressed the issues of (a) reliability in the instrumentation, (b) reliability of other input data or models, (c) reliability and confidence level of the path flows solution, (d) the relationship between what is observed and what is inferred, and (e) verifying that defined path flows are those actually occurring in the network (and discerned), which are all directly relevant to the practical application of path flow estimation and to guiding instrumentation research to meet the needs of the evolving world of transportation. Therefore, this dissertation research addresses the key questions of (1) how well can path flow rates be determined from an instrumented network, and (2) how much inference is required to yield reasonable estimates of all path utilization coefficients in a network. It was discovered that observed link flow data are only slightly better than spurious input data for PUC prediction; automatic vehicle identification (AVI) or automatic vehicle location (AVL) data are required to significantly improve predictions. Therefore, significant value is added by collecting AVI and AVL data to estimate PUCs or OD flows. Moreover, if predicting link volumes is desired, then link volume observations are also necessary &#226; AVI or AVL data are insufficient. Considering these results, all network analyses are critically dependent upon good utilization coefficient estimates to obtain reasonable flows which, in-turn, are essential for decision-makers. This is true whether you are attempting to estimate OD flows or PUCs (say as a modeler), desiring to make good capacity investment decisions, or trying to make real-time network flow management decisions. In all cases, good quality PUCs are necessary; reliance on link flow observations would require heroic inference assumptions so AVI and/or AVL data are better choices for PUC prediction. Within this dissertation are four components to support this research endeavor and the conclusions drawn. First is a discussion of the theoretical constructs involved in the path utilization rate estimation process. Second, a methodology for estimating PUCs is presented. Third, numerical tests of the methodology are conducted on several hypothetical networks. Fourth, throughout this research three data conditions were examined to test the methodology's predictions &#226; error-free data, stochasticity in demands coverage (such as in OD flows, link volumes, a priori path utilizations, and a priori link utilizations), and stochasticity in the demand measurements.</field><field name="date">2008-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212008-120210/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Creation of a Radical System: Baron d'Holbach's Systeme de la Nature and the Enlightenment in Tension</field><field name="creator">Bryan, Joseph Daniel</field><field name="description">Paul-Henri Thiry, Baron d&#226;Holbach (1723-1789) was an important figure in the Enlightenment and has been a permanent fixture in Enlightenment scholarship throughout the twentieth century. Yet, while this scholarship has generally recognized d&#226;Holbach&#226;s role in the Enlightenment, he is cited more often for his salon (la Synagogue d&#226;Holbach, la coterie holbachique) than for his thought. This traditional account of d&#226;Holbach is being challenged by more recent scholars who assert the primacy of a &#226;Radical Enlightenment&#226; over and above that of a moderate and counter Enlightenment. They regard d&#226;Holbach as the capstone of an intellectual movement that had exhausted its novelty, but they have failed to provide the detailed analysis that would substantiate this claim. I believe that d&#226;Holbach&#226;s magnum opus Syst&#195;&#168;me de la Nature combines intellectual traditions in a manner that goes beyond the traditional and current studies of the Enlightenment. An investigation of this work will not only serve to expose the varieties of thought on which d&#226;Holbach based his system, but also show how d&#226;Holbach constructed his system with scientific and philosophical ideas and a specific argumentative strategy. This analysis will show that totalizing syntheses of the Enlightenment have rarely accounted for the tension and diversity of eighteenth-century thought.</field><field name="date">2008-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212008-132726/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stack Composition for SILO Architecture</field><field name="creator">Vellala, Manoj</field><field name="description">SILO is a new internetworking architecture that represents a significant departure from current philosophy and practice.

It takes a holistic view of network design, allowing applications to work synergistically with the network architecture and physical layers so as to meet the application's needs within resource availability constraints. The SILO research advocates a non-layered architecture based on silos of services assembled on demand and specific to an application and network environment.

In theory, the knot must be as small as possible to prevent an excessive amount of tissue reaction and a delay in healing. There have been reports suggesting that topical cyanoacrylate adhesives could have a reinforcing effect on a surgeon&#226;s knot. Such an outcome could lead to the elimination of knot slippage and the unsatisfactory performance of some surgical knots. The main purpose of this study was to determine if cyanoacrylate adhesive could have a significant reinforcing effect on typical suture types and sizes when tied as a surgeon&#226;s knot. The second aim was to evaluate if the cyanoacrylate adhesive could replace an additional throw in the surgeon&#226;s knot so as to achieve an equivalent mechanical performance. The topical cyanoacrylate adhesive LiquiBand&#194;&#174; was combined with six different suture materials (TicronTM, SurgidacTM, Ethilon*, Nurolon*, BiosynTM and PDS*II) in four different sizes (USP 5-0, USP 3-0, USP 0 and USP 1). The surgeon&#226;s knot (2=1) with and without one (2=1=1) and two additional throws (2=1=1=1) were tied in a reproducible way and mechanically tested. Six dependent variables were used to evaluate the performance of each knot with and without adhesive. The performance criteria were: the force at loop failure, the maximum loop-holding force, the loop holding capacity, the knot efficiency, the knot elongation efficiency and the loop distraction. From the results and from scanning electron microscopic observations of the reinforced knots, the cyanoacrylate adhesive was found to significantly improve the knot performance. The improvement was superior with braided sutures and with absorbable polymer sutures. The reinforcement was more significant with thicker suture sizes and with the plain surgeon&#226;s knot. Finally, it was found that, according to the six performance criteria, the cyanoacrylate adhesive could not replace an additional throw in the surgeon&#226;s knot.</field><field name="date">2009-04-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03212009-112007/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sound Barrier: Two-Year-Old Children?s Use of Newly Acquired Words to Describe Preverbal Memories</field><field name="creator">Dillard, S. Gwynn</field><field name="description">One of the proposed causes of childhood amnesia, the relative paucity of adults? memories for events occurring before the age of four, is the inability to verbally access preverbal memories. Although recent findings by Simcock and Hayne (2002) are consistent with this possibility, other researchers (Peterson &amp; Rideout, 1998; Bauer, Wenner, &amp; Kroupina, 2002) report some verbal access to memories acquired before the onset of productive language. The present research used the paradigm of color naming to further examine whether 2-year-old children can use newly acquired words to describe their preverbal memories. The method extended previous work by directly examining the acquisition of verbal labels and providing contextual support for memory performance. Participants learned a task requiring selecting a specific color. Those without color labels were taught them through eight structured sessions of age-appropriate color learning activities. After two months, the children's memory for the event was assessed verbally, then with visual cues, and finally through re-enactment. There were no group differences in implicit memory for the event (Fisher's Exact Test, p=0.31); children who knew the target label at encoding (n=20, mean age at recall 31.2 months), who acquired the label only after the intervention (n=8, M = 31.3 months), and who lacked the label at both pretest and posttest (n=9, M= 29.1 months) performed comparably in the re-enactment condition. Although 12 of 20 children who knew their target color word at the time of encoding could verbally access the memory at the time of recall, only one of 8 children who did not know their target word at encoding but learned it before recall could access the verbal label. However, this child incorrectly re-enacted the event. This research suggests that children cannot independently translate preverbal memories into words even with extensive task support. Therefore, language acquisition may indeed play an important role in the offset of childhood amnesia.</field><field name="date">2004-03-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222004-003125/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jetting Techniques for Pile Installation and Environmental Impact Minimization</field><field name="creator">Denton, Raymond Lynwood II</field><field name="description">This research is the second part of a two-part research process to develop a pile jetting model which encompasses pile insertion, debris zone modeling, and particle transport.

This research is composed of model development and verification of the laboratory model based on twenty six full-scale pile installations at four different test sites. Various pump configurations and soil profiles are investigated. Results of the field test program show that the proposed debris zone model based on the laboratory experimental program agrees well with the measured debris zone volumes generated at the field installations.

Often, teachers turn to what is popular in the technological world for new ideas to use in their classrooms. One such technology that has become extremely popular in Web culture is Web logs, now most often referred to as ?weblogs,? or simply ?blogs.? The present work seeks to further research on weblogs in education by identifying the various ways in which current post-secondary writing course teachers are using them in their courses. This definitional study attempts to answer the question: for what educational, or non-educational, purposes are weblogs in post-secondary writing courses being used? The study looks at the way educators claim to be using weblogs in their courses based on how they explain their blog assignments to students (either on a course syllabus or course blog posting). Adding depth to the analysis, the study also explores survey responses from thirty-two college writing teachers across the country. The eleven main uses for weblogs in writing courses that this study identifies are as follows: 1) as a public space with a broad audience, 2) to post student work, 3) as a journal, 4) to reflect on course-related assignments, 5) for student discussion and interaction, 6) to explore and share ideas, as well as brainstorm, 7) to engage with and respond to assigned readings, 8) for collaborative projects, 9) to link to Web materials, 10) to ask and answer questions related to the course, and 11) to discuss topics not necessarily related to the course. After compiling data as to these current uses of weblogs in college writing courses, this researcher explores the implications of these uses, offering suggestions and drawing conclusions as to how the new technology of weblogs has impacted and will impact college level writing courses.</field><field name="date">2005-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222005-205901/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of cyclic feeding on compensatory growth and water quality in hybrid striped bass, Morone chrysops x M. saxitilis.</field><field name="creator">Turano, Marc John</field><field name="description">A series of pond and tanks studies were conducted to determine if compensatory growth (CG) could be elicited in hybrid striped bass (HSB; Morone chrysops x M. saxitilis) through manipulations in feeding that involve sequential cycles of feed deprivation followed by daily satiation feeding. Growth, feed efficiency (FE), hepatosomatic index (HSI), intraperitoneal fat ratio (IPF), and condition factor (CF) were assessed at intervals throughout the growth trials to characterize the nutritional status (catabolic state) and CG response of HSB. Measurements of pituitary growth hormone (GH) cell activity (gene expression, protein stores), and plasma GH were assessed in tank studies to identify the potential catabolic and anabolic role of this growth promoting hormone during feed deprivation and CG. Lastly, the effects of the cyclic feeding regimes on water quality were assessed in ponds trials. In each of the three studies, growth compensation, defined by growth rates that exceed that of control fish fed daily, was observed when treatment fish were realimentated to a control daily satiation feeding following a period of feed deprivation. Cyclic feeding increased overall FE of treatment fish over the controls by 10.8-40.0 % in the first pond study (HSB fingerlings), and 7.0-8.5% in the second pond study (HSB food fish) but not in the tank study. Hepatasomatic index and CF varied significantly with feed deprivation and refeeding, and were useful predictors of the CG response following feed deprivation. There was an inverse relationship between all GH measurements and nutritional status, with no reported compensatory changes in GH. Changes in water quality parameters due to cyclic feeding were only observed in the pond study with HSB food fish. Ponds subjected to the cyclic feeding regimes had 25-38 % lower levels of total phosphorus, 23.9-41.3 % less soluble reactive phosphorus, and 11.6-27.8% less chlorophyll-a. Based on these results, CG can be repeatedly induced in HSB in both ponds and tanks, albeit full growth compensation was not achieved under the cyclic feeding conditions used in these studies. Regardless, these studies suggest that cyclic feeding can improve overall FE and water quality in pond-raised HSB. Further studies are required to ascertain the optimal catabolic conditions needed to induce full growth compensation during HSB production.</field><field name="date">2006-05-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222006-150555/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvement of Photon Buildup Factors for Radiological Assessment</field><field name="creator">Schirmers, Fritz Gordon</field><field name="description">Slant-path buildup factors for photons between 1 keV and 10 MeV for nine radiation shielding materials (air, aluminum, concrete, iron, lead, leaded glass, polyethylene, stainless steel, and water) are calculated with the most recent cross-section data available using Monte Carlo and discrete ordinates methods. Discrete ordinates calculations use a 244-group energy structure that is based on previous research at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), but extended with the results of this thesis, and its focused studies on low-energy photon transport and the effects of group widths in multigroup calculations. Buildup factor calculations in discrete ordinates benefit from coupled photon/electron cross sections to account for secondary photon effects. Also, ambient dose equivalent (herein referred to as dose) buildup factors were analyzed at lower energies where corresponding response functions do not exist in literature. The results of these studies are directly applicable to radiation safety at LANL, where the dose modeling tool Pandemonium is used to estimate worker dose in plutonium handling facilities. Buildup factors determined in this thesis will be used to enhance the code?s modeling capabilities, but should be of interest to the radiation shielding community.</field><field name="date">2006-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222006-172828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benchmarking the Management of Construction Programs</field><field name="creator">Grasso, Barton</field><field name="description">The management of large capital improvement construction programs involves the efforts of both internal staff and external service providers. An understanding of how construction programs are managed, either through internal or external staff, is essential in tracking future trends and determining improvements and best practices in the management process. To address this need a survey was developed by a focus group of industry professionals. The survey was distributed to the membership of a number of professional organizations that represented owners within the construction industry. The survey attempted to determine both the current status of managing a construction program throughout a broad range of demographic characteristics (including the definition of program management) and the hiring of an external program manager. The survey and subsequent analysis that focused on the management of a construction program examined the following key points: role of a program manager, internal capabilities, outsourcing, sourcing strategy, and management costs. The survey and subsequent analysis that focused on hiring an external program manager examined: program management fees, type of firms used in managing a construction program, factors considered when hiring a program manager, and organizational structure. The results of the survey have also been segregated by public and private organizations to denote any differences in the management of public and private construction programs.

The research that has been conducted (Fought 2003; Penfield and Ornstein-Galicia 1985; Metcalf 1972) is a good start, but needs more precision and rigor. There is a need to describe this prosodic feature in more accurate terms than line drawings accompanied by a narrow number scale (Metcalf 1972). In 1992 Beckman and Hirschberg proposed their solution to this gap with the ToBI Annotation Conventions, which is the current model used for measuring intonation. This thesis uses ToBI conventions in conjunction with Praat spectrograms to compare the intonation of Mexican American English to Anglo American English. Results indicate that speakers of these two groups do typically differ in intonational patterns, most noticeably in final contours and pitch accents. These intonational differences contribute to the distinctness of each variety, which can cause misunderstandings in communication (e.g.: MAE declarative mistaken for interrogative). The results of this study contribute to the understanding of Mexican American English and to the comparative examination of intonation based on natural conversation.</field><field name="date">2007-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222007-124316/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Durable and Non-Toxic Topical Flame Retardants for Cotton and Cotton Blends</field><field name="creator">Mathews, Marc Christopher</field><field name="description">Flame retardant chemicals were used as topical finishes on cotton and cotton blended fabric. Comparison of flame resistance and durability of non-bromine/non-antimony flame retardants were explored based on flame resistance testing and physical testing results. Three 100% cotton fabrics and 3 cotton blended fabrics were used. Twenty one different commercially available flame retardants were used as topical finishes on all fabric types. Fabrics were treated and tested at 0, 5, 10 and 25 washes. Final results show that two of the phosphorus flame retardants were durable to 25 washes. Physical testing results show that there were undesirable side effects from the two durable topical treatments.

I use a gendered resource allocation model that recognizes differences in investment preferences between men and women and how women can use increases in their relative earnings to direct greater amounts of family resources towards enrichment goods and services that promote child well-being. Support for this model comes mostly from research conducted outside of the United States. This study contributes to this research literature by using an American sample drawn from the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. In addition, I contribute to the research on maternal employment and child outcomes with a longitudinal analysis of children?s cognitive development trajectories from age five to 14. I find some negative effects on children?s initial levels of cognitive skills for measures of both early and current maternal employment hours. Some of these effects are moderated by race, the supportiveness of children?s home environment, and mothers? cognitive skills. Contrary to predictions from a gendered resource allocation model, I find that children?s cognitive development is lowest in households in which mothers? and fathers? incomes approximate parity, likely because of a lack of clear specialization in such households. I discuss these findings in terms of theoretical, research, and policy applications.</field><field name="date">2007-04-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222007-133600/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does Working for a Better Performing Boss Improve Subordinate Performance? A Longitudinal, Quasi-experimental Study</field><field name="creator">Sloan, Stephanie Leigh</field><field name="description">The current study examined the relationship between supervisor and subordinate performance, explored the impact of supervisor performance on subordinate performance and performance change over time, and investigated whether supervisor performance has a stronger impact on subordinate performance over time than initial subordinate performance has on supervisor performance over time. This study utilized a longitudinal, quasi-experimental design with multiple sources of measurement. Multisource managerial performance ratings from 2001 to 2003 were obtained from a large multinational technology firm. Subordinates and their bosses? performance ratings from different sources were investigated by correlational and multiple regression analyses. Separate analyses were conducted on a subset of the subordinates who experienced a change in supervisor between years one (2001) and two (2002) and another subset who did not experience change in supervisor over the three year study. The correlational and predictive analyses revealed that supervisor performance and change in supervisor performance did not relate to or predict the performance or performance change of subordinates at the middle management level. Change in supervisor performance, specifically when a supervisor is replaced by another supervisor with a different level of performance, did not predict change in subordinate performance concurrently or over time. Finally, neither initial supervisor performance nor initial subordinate performance differentially predicted later subordinate or supervisor performance over time.</field><field name="date">2007-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03222007-150340/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The Extremest Necessity:" Lincoln's Policies on Civil Liberties and Citizen Responses, 1861-1865</field><field name="creator">Martin, Elizabeth Mae-Carr</field><field name="description">Abraham Lincoln has been viewed alternately as a hero of the Union or a tyrant who abused his power.

Highway capacity has often not been upgraded in line with this demand growth. In the case of Hurricane Floyd in 1999, evacuations of areas of North and South Carolina resulted in several highly congested primary highways and, as a result, several states created Lane Reversal Plans for interstates and/or divided highways along evacuation routes. However, these plans were created with little data to rely on as to their efficiency. A major research study was funded by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) to use simulation modeling to investigate the effects of the Interstate 40 Lane Reversal Plan on the evacuation of Wilmington and New Hanover County, North Carolina. In addition to the analysis of the effects of lane reversal, a side-by-side comparison of the CORSIM and VISSIM simulation models was performed on the highway network based on demand estimates provided by a demand study performed for the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Analysis using CORSIM and VISSIM showed lane reversal to provide considerable capacity increases to traffic attempting to exit New Hanover County via Interstate 40, which had significantly increased throughput and decreased queues within New Hanover County in the event of large-scale evacuations.</field><field name="date">2005-03-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232005-185245/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mentoring and Talent Development: Doctoral Advisors and Their Prot&#233;g&#233;s</field><field name="creator">Lunsford, Laura Gail</field><field name="description">This study examines the effect of mentoring on five doctoral student outcomes: satisfaction with advisor, intellectual property events, publications, presentations, and degree progress.

Process Simulation, Economics and Potential Benefits</field><field name="creator">Lindstrom, Mathias Erik Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Gasification of black liquor could drastically increase the flexibility and improve the profit potential of a mature industry. The continuous efforts made in the area of black liquor gasification (BLG) are bringing this technology closer to commercial realization and potential wide-spread implementation. Research exploring the integration of BLG into the kraft process and the potential of BLG enabled modified pulping technologies on modern pulping operations is important to support this effort. The following effort is focused on such research, utilizing laboratory pulping experiments and process simulation. The separation of sodium and sulfur achieved through gasification of recovered black liquor can be utilized in processes like modified continuous cooking, split sulfidity and green liquor pretreatment pulping, and polysulfide-anthraquinone pulping to improve pulp yield and properties. Laboratory pulping protocols have been developed for these modified pulping technologies and different process options evaluated. The process simulation work around BLG has led to the development of a WinGEMS module for the low temperature MTCI steam reforming process, and case studies comparing a simulated conventional kraft process to different process options built around the implementation of a BLG unit operation into the kraft recovery cycle. The implementation of gasification, functioning as the core of wood pulping recovery operations in a biorefinery, would enable the application of modified pulping technologies while creating a synthetic product gas that could be utilized in the production of value added products in addition to wood pulp. The evaluated modified pulping technologies have indicated the potential of yield increases of 1-3% points with improved product quality, and the potential for capital and operating cost savings relative to the conventional kraft process. Process simulation work has shown that the net variable operating cost for a pulping process using BLGCC is highly dependent on the cost of lime kiln fuel and the selling price of green power to the grid. Under the initial assumptions taken in the performed case study, the BLGCC process combined with split sulfidity or PSAQ pulping operations had net variable operating cost 2-4% greater than the kraft reference. When comparing the BLG cases to the MCC reference, the net variable operating cost break even point based on lime kiln fuel cost is about $47/barrel for the split sulfidity and lower charge polysulfide processes, and about $38/barrel for the higher polysulfide charge process. This is significantly lower than assumed kiln fuel price of $60/barrel used in this work. If the sales price for power to the grid could be increased through green power credits from 3.5 to 6 &#162;/KWh cost savings of about $40/ODtP could be realized in the investigated BLG processes. Other alternatives to improve the process economics around BLG would be to modify or eliminate the lime kiln unit operations, utilizing high sulfidity green liquor pretreatment, PSAQ with auto-causticization, or converting the process to mini-sulfide sulfite-AQ.</field><field name="date">2007-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232007-120400/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reexamining synthetic speech: Intelligibility and the effects of age, task, and speech type on recall</field><field name="creator">Hardee, Jefferson Brandon</field><field name="description">Synthetic speech is a technology that can be utilized to convey information and aid people in their tasks. Older adults in particular are a population that may be able to benefit from synthetic speech, and they are a population that has been investigated in a limited capacity. The current researchers intended to elucidate lingering conflicts in previous research on the intelligibility and recall of word and stories in synthetic speech for older and younger adults and how that compared to similar conditions in natural speech. Twenty-four older and 24 younger adults completed intelligibility and recall tasks with word lists and stories. Results indicated that older adults had a more difficult time with all speech, natural speech was easier to understand and remember than synthetic speech, and stories were easier to recall than words. Results also indicated that older adults had a more difficult time understanding synthetic words as compared to natural words than younger adults. In addition, older adults improved differentially with the recall of stories as opposed to words when compared to the younger adult group. Potential directions for synthetic speech software design and future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232007-135410/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elizabeth Bishop's Quest for the Ordinary</field><field name="creator">Helm, Daniel Joseph</field><field name="description">Poetry by Elizabeth Bishop is filled with issues of domesticity and belonging, intimacy and loss, as well as transparent language and local scenes, all of which are types or expressions of ordinariness. Building from the philosophy of Wittgenstein, Stanley Cavell proposes that ordinariness ? both ordinary language and everyday life ? presents the greatest challenge to philosophical skepticism. To Cavell, skepticism threatens us with doubt and the inhumanity of disconnection from life and the world. In In Quest of the Ordinary, Cavell describes challenging the skeptical threat with the resettling of the everyday, a domestication of skepticism that makes life a livable place. Cavell?s sense of a need for opposition to skepticism that makes life livable is confirmed by readers of Bishop who find her handling questions, doubts, and the frustration of loss in a way that seems manageable and a way that also emphasizes the significance of ordinariness. Cavell?s work is an opportunity to characterize the recurring patterns and themes as well as the contrasts and the differences in Bishop?s poems as a search for ordinariness. I claim that ordinariness in Bishop?s poetry exists, as in Cavell, in dialogue with skepticism, so that Bishop?s quest for the ordinary is a struggle to protect against as well as preserve skepticism. The quest, as both Cavell and Bishop depict it, is endless because ordinariness is elusive, but a struggle with and for ordinariness is appealing, both in Bishop?s poetry and Cavell?s philosophy, because it alternately allows hope and skepticism. Her poems are widely appreciated because, as Randall Jarrell said, they suggest ?it is barely but perfectly possible? to live in the world.</field><field name="date">2007-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232007-141516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emperors, Ghosts, and Fools</field><field name="creator">Hegmann, Elisabeth Ann</field><field name="description">Emperors, Ghosts, and Fools is a collection of linked fantasy short stories culminating in a novella. The characters&#226; concerns center on trying to reach Modus Perfectus, a musical utopia located in a just-out-of-reach island chain called the Apogean Islands in the Brimful Puddle. Those who yearn for Modus Perfectus include a hideously ugly woman who serves as a town troll, a gonzo architect, a music hater, a music addict, movie actors, rock stars, and sad sack birthday clowns. Their stories unfold, always with plenty of humor, in the form of told-beside-the-fire ghost tales and small town coming-of-age or small town has-been tales, in the gothic lair of a mad scientist, in the suspense of escaping a derailing train, or in the desire for one last chance at love despite being dead.

The model created utilized three error proofing concepts: the FMEA, TRIZ Solution Directions, and the Error Proofing Healthcare (EPH) model. The research involved analyzing 250 FMEA&#226;s that were previously conducted in a large transactional corporation and obtaining feedback from associates. The model that was created consisted of three phases. Phase one identifies the potential failures that could occur within a process while phase two uses TRIZ solution directions to create multiple innovative solutions and phase three uses a method called Solution Priority Number (SPN) to rank and evaluate the solutions generated. The SPN consists of the return on investment (ROI) and the ease of implementation of each solution. Excel worksheets were created to support the Error Proofing Transaction (EPT) model. A case study was performed within a large transactional corporation. A team completed the existing FMEA and then completed the new EPT model. When comparing the existing FMEA and the EPT model it was found that the EPT model reduced the team meeting time by 50% and produced more failure modes, more effects, more causes, more high risk failure modes, as well as a more enhanced set of solutions.</field><field name="date">2009-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232009-132445/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disadvantaged Neighborhoods and Anger: Implications for Community-Level Theories of Crime and Delinquency</field><field name="creator">Burns, Padraic Joseph</field><field name="description">This paper is a partial and exploratory test of Bernard&#226;s (1990) theory of angry aggression within disadvantaged communities as well as Agnew&#226;s (1999) community-level strain theory. These theories posit that disadvantage and other structural characteristics of neighborhoods lead to environmental stressors, which ultimately may increase anger among individuals who externalize attributions of blame. To date, no study has assessed whether structural characteristics of neighborhoods are related to increased individual anger. Using Ross and Britt&#226;s (1995) survey of Community, Crime, and Health: Illinois Residents, I assess Bernard&#226;s (1990) and Agnew&#226;s (1999) theoretical arguments. The findings show that only one structural indicator measured at the census tract level, urban location, is related to the individual outcome of anger. However, the stressors assessed in this study are positively related to anger, particularly among individuals who externalize blame. There are two main implications of these findings. (1) Community crime models should include measures of emotions such as anger, as community processes have psychological impacts on individuals that may motivate them to commit criminal acts. (2) The structural indicators identified by Bernard (1990) and Agnew (1999) require reevaluation, as only urban location was shown to be related to anger.</field><field name="date">2009-04-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232009-174821/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual Dimorphism in the Tarsals: Implications for Sex Determination.</field><field name="creator">Harris, Sheena Marie</field><field name="description">The accurate determination of sex is the first analytic task of physical anthropologists in the study of human skeletal remains. Correct sex determinations are essential because most other skeletal analyses rely on this to be accurately determined. Although morphological features of the skull and pelvis have been traditionally used for sex determination, certain metric analyses have also been useful. In the absence of the most commonly used bones, metric measurements obtained from the tarsals have the ability to provide accurate information regarding sex. Metric sex assessments are based on the levels of sexual dimorphism between males and females. This thesis evaluates the presence of sexual dimorphism in the tarsals and their dimensions of length, width, and height and assesses which bones and dimensions are most useful for sex determination using a modern skeletal sample (n = 160) comprised of individuals of known sex and age. Summary statistics were calculated for males and females separately to assess the sexual variation for each measure. Pearson&#226;s Correlation Coefficient was used to establish correlations between sex and each measurement. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the levels of sexual dimorphism in the bones and dimensions for the sample. Accuracy of sex estimations was compared between the left and right sides for each bone to determine if one side was more sexually dimorphic than the other. Logistic regression coefficients from the most accurate bones and dimensions were generated from the sample, which can be used to develop equations to accurately sex other samples of similar Euro-American ancestry. The most sexually dimorphic tarsals were the talus and first cuneiform. Tarsals from the right side were slightly more sexually dimorphic than those from the left. Length and height dimensions were more variable than breadth dimensions. Correct classifications for individual variables were as high as 87.8 %, with the highest overall percentage of correct classification of 93.5% obtained from a combination of all height measurements from the right tarsals for the total sample. This has implications for sexing skeletal remains from archaeological samples when other more commonly used bones are absent or poorly preserved.</field><field name="date">2009-05-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03232009-180421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microwave Power Oscillator utilizing Thin-Film Varactor</field><field name="creator">Victor, Alan M</field><field name="description">Synthesis of Microwave Power Oscillators utilizing Thin-film Varactors.

Tools for examining the influence of individual training set patterns on the learning abilities of individual neurons are put forth and utilized in the implementation of new network learning algorithms. Algorithms are based largely on the supervised training algorithm: backpropagation, and all experiments use the standard backpropagation algorithm for comparison of results. The focus of the new learning algorithms revolve around the addition of two main components. The first addition is that of an unsupervised learning algorithm called flocking. Flocking attempts to provide network hyperplane divisions that are evenly influenced by examples on either side of the hyperplane. The second addition is that of a multi-tasking approach called convergence training. Convergence training uses the information provided by a clustering algorithm in order to create subtasks that represent the divisions between clusters. These subtasks are then trained in unison in order to promote hyperplane sharing within the problem space. Generalization was improved in most cases and the solutions produced by the new learning algorithms are demonstrated to be very robust against different random weight initializations. This research is not only a search for better generalizing ANN learning algorithms, but also a search for better understanding when dealing with the complexities involved in ANN generalization.</field><field name="date">2003-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242003-075528/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is Justice Contextual? A Cross-National Analysis of Married Women's Perceptions of Fairness of the Division of Household Labor</field><field name="creator">Davis, Shannon Nicole</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to examine married women?s perceptions of the division of household labor. Distributive justice theory has suggested the mechanisms through which individuals determine their situations are fair. However, the majority of applications of the distributive justice theory have been focused on Western nations. This research extends these previous applications in two ways. First, the self-evaluation theory is integrated with distributive justice theory and elaborated into a new theory, called Contextual Distributive Justice Theory. Second, part of this new theory is tested using a sample of 4581 married women from the International Social Justice Project data. Using multi-level analysis, this research suggests that context does matter in predicting married women?s perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor. There are statistically significant differences in women?s average perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor based upon their nation of residence. Context indirectly affects women?s perceptions of fairness through national ideology and women?s overall empowerment. Further, women?s individual measures of empowerment affect their perceptions of fairness differently based upon the overall empowerment of women in their nation of residence. Implications for further theoretical elaboration and empirical examination are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004-03-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242004-094818/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Efficacy of World Wide Web-Mediated Microcomputer-Based Laboratory Activities in the High School Physics Classroom</field><field name="creator">Slykhuis, David Alan</field><field name="description">This research project examined the efficacy of an online microcomputer-based laboratory based (MBL) physics unit.

Traffic grooming allows the resources available on a single wavelength to be utilized by multiple traffic streams. These networks will support large amounts of traffic from various sources. In view of this, our research focuses on the analysis of such types of networks, and in particular on a traffic-groomed tandem optical network that supports multiple sources each with unique resource requirements. We developed a decomposition algorithm for the analysis of this network using a modified version of Courtois? method. This work was extended to analyze tandem networks with a large number of wavelengths and resources per wavelength using a modified version of the recursion developed by Nilsson et. al. Finally, we extended our work to a traffic-groomed tandem optical network employing alternate routing and supporting traffic from multiple sources. For each method, numerical results show that, overall, our approximation provides good accuracy.</field><field name="date">2005-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242005-005650/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mesh Structures with Tailored Properties and Applications in Hip Stems.</field><field name="creator">Cansizoglu, Omer</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research has been to develop mesh structures with tailored properties for hip stems. Stress shielding is one of the crucial problems with current hip implants due to the modulus mismatch between the bone and the hip stem. Solid titanium or cobalt-chromium stems are changing the natural stress patterns in the femur. Stresses are transferred through the hip stem and are concentrated more at the distal end of the stem, which weakens the top portion of the femur and overloads the distal portion of the femur. Stress shielding in the long term may result in implant failure due to bone loss, which is costly and painful for the patient. Naturally, biomaterials have tailored structures that display optimal behaviors under tensile, bending and other applied loads. Bones are also tailored to the loading conditions and show stress patterns accordingly. This thesis reports on the development of new hip implants where the mechanical properties of the stems are tailored to match the bone&#226;s properties using open cell structures and mesh structures. Solid free form fabrication techniques are used in this thesis to manufacture parts in the Electron Beam Melting (EBM) by Arcam AB, Sweden. This processing method offers a unique way of making hip stems with mesh and solid sections together in one build. Different designs of hip stems have been manufactured and tested. Their affects on the bones have been analyzed and demonstrated using the Finite Element Analysis (ABAQUS). Hip implants were tested on cadaver bones to measure the difference between mesh stems and solid commercial hip stems. This thesis also includes studies about the mesh quality under different processing conditions, and the applications of structural optimization.</field><field name="date">2008-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242008-150702/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deliberate Memory in Three-Year-Old Children: Interrelations among Task Approaches, Working Memory, and Inhibitory Control</field><field name="creator">Turner, Kimberly Ann</field><field name="description">Preschool children are capable of displaying strategies in memory tasks and demonstrating an early understanding of memorization (e. g., Wellman, 1988; Baker-Ward, Ornstein, &amp; Holden, 1984). Questions remain, however, about the origins of strategic behavior in early childhood. A great deal of recent attention has been devoted to the interrelations among working memory and measures of executive functioning/inhibitory control in elementary-school children (e.g., Schneider, Schumann-Hengsteler, &amp; Sodian, 2005). The goal of this investigation was to extend this work to preschool children in order to examine possible influences on the emergence of deliberate remembering. Specifically, interrelations among working memory, inhibitory control, and deliberate task approaches were examined in 168 three-year-olds who participated in a large-scale, broadly-focused investigation of development, the Durham Child Health and Development Study. Although predicted relations among multiple domains of cognitive functioning were not observed, important findings did emerge. Previous results examining the use of deliberate task approaches were replicated in a more diverse and younger sample. Support for the presence of deliberate remembering in young preschoolers was found in a significant positive relation between language ability and the extent of deliberate task approaches. Finally, an unexpected relation between deliberate task approaches and subsequent recall performance was found; this result is discussed in relation to Utilization Deficiency. Implications for understanding some of the contributors to the emergence of deliberate remembering are presented, and directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242008-181800/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design for Six Sigma: Design and Development of an Equine Composite Flooring System</field><field name="creator">Wood, Jesse William</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to develop a composite flooring system to be used in the equine surgical unit in the College of Veterinary Medicine at North Carolina State University.

Five documents bear witness to the events, and each presents problems for historians. The accounts of Ad&#195;&#169;mar of Chabannes and Paul of St P&#195;&#168;re de Chartres have received more attention than others, since they hint at the presence of dualist heretics in France, whom some historians have sought to link to the dualist Bogomils of Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire. Though the consensus on the origins of heretics in France has shifted to emphasize local conditions in the emergence of heresy, recent document discoveries have revived the debate. Most prominent of these is the so-called &#226;Letter of H&#195;&#169;ribert&#226; describing seemingly dualist heretics in P&#195;&#169;rigord. Previously believed to a twelfth century document, it has recently been discovered in an eleventh-century version. This thesis argues that the &#226;Letter&#226; describes not dualist heretics, but conscientious Christians taking responsibility for their own salvation. It further contends that this group can be identified as the &#226;Manichaeans&#226; whom Ad&#195;&#169;mar of Chabannes describes as appearing in Aquitaine in 1018, and that when he applied the same label to the heretics of Orl&#195;&#169;ans, he was not truly describing the latter group. The similarities between the doctrines adduced to the heretics and those of the Bogomils are considered, and it is argued that these are due to the influence of Orthodox monks on their Western brethren. Finally, it considers the implications of this for the study of eleventh-century heresy.</field><field name="date">2009-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242009-002231/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection and Control of Histamine-Producing Bacteria in Fish</field><field name="creator">Bjornsdottir, Kristin</field><field name="description">Histamine (or scombroid) fish poisoning the most frequently reported illness associated with consumption of fish despite efforts of its control. The lack of adequate control measures and unreliable detection method for histamine-producing bacteria (HPB) can in part be responsible for the high incidence of the disease. The aim of the studies was to address these concerns. Available detection methods were compared and related to histamine-production. Next, a DNA probe based on the histidine decarboxylase (hdc) gene was developed and applied to colony lift hybridization for enumeration of HPB from fish. Finally, the used of phosphate as a control of HPB was examined. The results demonstrated that the potentiometric, and PCR detection methods accurately detected high-HPB but did not detect the low histamine producing isolates. Although, the culture-based Nivens method, detected low histamine-producing bacteria, it resulted in 38% false positive responses. A hdc-probe mix from four HPB detected all 73 high-histamine producing bacteria in DNA dot-blot hybridization. However, six low and seventy-three non-HPB were not detected. Application of the hdc-probe mix in colony-lift hybridization resulted in more accurate quantification of HPB compared to the commonly used Niven&#226;s method. Phosphate treatment of mahi-mahi samples significantly reduced histamine-production by increasing the surface pH of the fish muscle. The ability not only to detect but enumerate histamine-producing bacteria in fish is important for evaluating the potential risks and to develop adequate control strategies prior to formation of toxic levels of histamine.</field><field name="date">2009-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242009-101524/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Experimental Evaluation of a Novel Annuloplasty Ring with a Shape Memory Alloy Core</field><field name="creator">Purser, Molly Ferris</field><field name="description">A novel annuloplasty ring with a shape memory alloy core has been developed to facilitate minimally invasive mitral valve repair. In its activated (Austenitic) phase, this prototype ring provides comparable mechanical properties as commercial semi-rigid rings. In its pre-activated (Martensitic) phase, this ring is flexible enough to be introduced through an 8 mm trocar and easily manipulated with robotic instruments within the confines of a left atrial model. The core is constructed of 0.508 mm diameter NiTi, which is maintained below its Ms temperature (24 &#194;&#176;C) during deployment and suturing. After suturing, the stiffener is heated above its Af temperature (37 &#194;&#176;C, slightly below normal human body temperature) enabling the NiTi to retain its optimal geometry and stiffness characteristics indefinitely. The NiTi core is shape set in a furnace to the appropriate size and optimal geometry during fabrication. The ring is cooled in a saline bath prior to surgery, making it compliant and easy to manipulate. Evaluation of the ring included mechanical testing, robotic evaluation, static pressure testing, dynamic flow testing and fatigue testing. Experimental results suggest that the NiTi core ring could be a viable alternative to flexible bands in robot-assisted mitral valve repair.</field><field name="date">2009-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242009-105427/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the Future of Technical Engineering Graphics Education? A Survey of Graphic Professionals Focused on the Emerging Themes of Technical/Engineering Graphics Education in the United States</field><field name="creator">Downs, Brian</field><field name="description">This research explored emergent trends in technical/engineering graphics education as prior research suggested that changes had occurred in the instructional topics and practices of the field. Prior research also showed that instructors wondered if the same topics were taught by graphics professionals as a part of their curriculum at other institutions. The areas researched in this study were: course offerings, student populations, professional development, technical/engineering graphics education, and future research. The study sample of fifty-six (N=56) graphics education instructors was selected from Engineering Design Graphics Division (EDGD) members that were listed in the 2007-2008 membership directory, provided a valid email address to American Society for Engineering Educators (ASEE), had achieved at least a Bachelor&#226;s degree, and taught at least one graphics course a year. The EDGD members were contacted via email and responses were collected by an online survey instrument. Overall, the results were checked for invalid responses, compiled, and then compared to the results of previous research from 1998 and 2004. The results of this study showed a decline in the instruction of: GD&amp;T, manual instruments, 2-D CAD, 3-D modeling, and CAM. The results indicated no change in 3-D constraint-based modeling instruction, but an increase in the instruction of animation. A decline in female students enrolled in technical/engineering graphics courses was also reported; however, an increase was reported in ethic minority students enrolled in the same courses. The results indicated a decline in the number of educational institutions that offered technical/engineering graphics as a major degree, but an increase in institutions that offered a minor in the same field. Furthermore, the results indicated that as time progressed and technology advanced, the topics taught within technical/engineering graphics courses shifted from traditional topics and to new emergent topics. Common concerns of respondents were difficulties remaining up-to-date with changes within the field and the preparedness of incoming students to the field. Possible future trends identified in this study were all software related and included: an increased emphasis on 3-D CAD, the increased instruction of animation, and a migration to online and distance education from traditional classroom instruction. The field of technical/engineering graphics education appeared to be strong and had adapted to industrial advancements and curriculum changes.</field><field name="date">2009-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242009-174715/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spherical Microwave Confinement and Ball Lightning</field><field name="creator">Robinson, William Richard</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the results of research done on unconventional energy technologies from 1995 to 2009. The present civilization depends on an infrastructure that was constructed and is maintained almost entirely using concentrated fuels and ores, both of which will run out. Diffuse renewable energy sources rely on this same infrastructure, and hence face the same limitations. I first examined sonoluminescence directed toward fusion, but demonstrated theoretically that this is impossible. I next studied Low Energy Nuclear Reactions and developed methods for improving results, although these have not been implemented. In 2000 I began Spherical Microwave Confinement (SMC), which confines and heats plasma with microwaves in a spherical chamber. The reactor was designed and built to provide the data needed to investigate the possibility of achieving fusion conditions with microwave confinement. A second objective was to attempt to create ball lightning (BL). The reactor featured 20 magnetrons, which were driven by a capacitor bank and operated in a 0.2 s pulse mode at 2.45 GHz. These provided 20 kW to an icosahedral array of 20 antennas. Video of plasmas led to a redesign of the antennas to provide better coupling of the microwaves to the plasma. A second improvement was a grid at the base of the antennas, which provided corona electrons and an electric field to aid quick formation of plasmas. Although fusion conditions were never achieved and ball lightning not observed, experience gained from operating this basic, affordable system has been incorporated in a more sophisticated reactor design intended for future research. This would use magnets that were originally planned. The cusp geometry of the magnetic fields is suitable for electron cyclotron resonance in the same type of closed surface that in existing reactors has generated high-temperature plasmas. Should ball lightning be created, it could be a practical power source with nearly ideal characteristics that could solve many of our current energy-production problems.</field><field name="date">2010-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03242010-110137/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms for Computations in Local Symmetric Spaces</field><field name="creator">Fowler, Jennifer Renee</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we use finite semisimple Lie theory to compute the structure of a local symmetric space p and its corresponding symmetric space P.

Plasma homocysteine(hcys) levels have a tendency to rise with age and changes in nutrition. Hcys can affect coagulation proteins, altering the formation of blood clots. The mechanism(s) by which hcys might cause modification of coagulation proteins "in vivo" is not understood. My hypothesis is that adult and juvenile animals could respond differently to chronic administration of hcys, and elevated plasma levels of hcys might lead to modification of fibrinogen "in vivo". Methodology: Six months old (juvenile, n=6) and 12 month old (adult, n=6) New Zealand White rabbits were divided into control (n=3) and homocysteine-treated (hcys-trt) (n=3) groups and injected for seven weeks; afterwards, they were given a bolus injection of hcys. Blood was drawn to evaluate plasma clearance of hcys. At the end, rabbits were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture and blood was collected for coagulation studies. Results: Juvenile hcys-trt rabbits adapted to chronic administration of hcys, however, adult hcys-trt rabbits developed Hhcys. Adult hcys-trt rabbits had higher levels of malonaldehyde in liver tissue, which is evidence of oxidative stress. Juvenile hcys-trt rabbits had similar malonaldehyde levels as juvenile control rabbits. Plasma elimination of hcys was impaired in adult hcys-trt rabbits. Adult hcys-trt rabbits had increased fibrinogen levels, longer reptilase times, and shorter thrombin clotting times versus adult control rabbits. Clots formed from purified fibrinogen obtained from hcys-trt rabbits lysed slower than comparable clots formed from control rabbits purified fibrinogen. Some congenital dysfibrinogenemias have clots that are abnormally resistant to fibrinolysis due to alterations in fibrinogen structure, and lead to recurrent thrombosis. Clotting results for adult hcys-trt rabbits suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia leads to a similar acquired dysfibrinogenmia. Therefore, the prolonged reptilase times and formation of clots that are abnormally resistant to fibrinolysis could directly contribute to increased risk of thrombosis in hyperhomocysteinemia.</field><field name="date">2003-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252003-183839/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design Flow Based on Sensitivity Analysis for High-speed Digital Circuits</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Andrew Stacy</field><field name="description">The purpose of this work is to develop a design flow for high-speed digital circuits that may be used to increase the quality of circuit performance and improve the ability of inexperienced circuit designers.

Performance appraisals are often completed in organizations by individual raters, whose ratings are then compared to one another in order to make inferences of the ratee?s performance on the job. Disagreements in ratings can lead to erroneous conclusions unless it is first established that comparisons between the rater groups are appropriate. Ratings of soldiers by two supervisory rater groups (N = 1052 and N = 910) on an appraisal instrument designed specifically for the Special Forces were examined. An exploratory factor analysis of the ratings indicated a four-factor model, which was then subsequently used to test for measurement invariance between the rater groups using multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis and item response theory. Fit indices indicated reasonable fit of the model, and ratings were concluded to be invariant at the rater group level of analysis, indicating that the rater groups refer to similar mental models of performance when rating individual soldiers.</field><field name="date">2005-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252005-021113/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of coyote introgression into the red wolf genome</field><field name="creator">Beck, Karen</field><field name="description">Extensive predator control programs and habitat alterations reduced red wolves, once native to the southeastern United States, to a remnant population found in only a small portion of their historic range by the late 1960?s. Coyotes expanded their range into territories previously occupied by red wolves. As wolves became scarce, they began to breed with the more prevalent coyote. Introgression threatened the continued existence of the genetic integrity of the red wolf. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, following a planned extirpation and institution of a captive breeding program, reintroduced red wolves to northeastern North Carolina in 1987. Though surveys had shown no evidence of coyotes in the reintroduction area, coyotes expanded their range eastward and a small red wolf population again interfaced with an increasing coyote population. The movement of introgression within the red wolf population is akin to the movement of an infectious disease. Identification of ?infected? and ?non-infected? individuals is accomplished at an early age in this population through pup assessments in the den. Intervention is accomplished through the use of sterilized coyotes and coyote-wolf hybrids to prevent the spread of the ?disease? to ?susceptible? individuals. Understanding how the ?disease? moves through the population by describing movement rates and the potential for contact between ?infected? and ?susceptible? individuals is accomplished through the analysis of telemetry locations of radiocollared individuals. The model for this ?disease? is also presented and evaluated to determine the effectiveness of intervention strategies in controlling the spread of this ?disease?.</field><field name="date">2006-08-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252005-042952/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical constraints on causality-violating spacetimes in general relativity</field><field name="creator">Janca, Andrew Joseph</field><field name="description">The theoretical possibility of global causality violation has long been a problem within general relativity, for there exists a large number of model spacetimes known to admit &lt;I&gt;closed timelike curves&lt;/I&gt;, trajectories allowing a timelike observer to return to some point in her own past. However, nearly all such known models have some unphysical feature. These physicality issues rendered causality-violation to the status of an interesting but safely theoretical problem until twenty years ago, when the appearance of a new type of causality-violating model spacetime and the subsequent proliferation of new models admitting closed timelike curves forced the attention of the community to the issue, and made causality violation and its possible physical consequences an active area of research within general relativity. This paper focuses on some of the older causality-violating spacetimes which model matter sources with cylindrical symmetry. By describing how cylindrically-symmetric solutions can be embedded within a spatially bounded and physically realistic body which outwardly has the symmetry of a torus or ring, it is shown that the chief problem of physical plausibility which these older solutions possess can be resolved. The intention is to make these models active candidates for consideration in future experiments to test general relativity's prediction that causality violation is a phenomenon that could be observed in the real world. Attending chapters describe physical systems other than rotating objects that can alter a local observer's experience of time to a substantial extent, including an electrically-charged massive shell slowing time in its interior (though not affecting causality) and a class of trajectories in the Reissner-Nordstr&#246;m background that could in principle allow a timelike observer to reverse her personal arrow of time relative to other observers in the spacetime as a whole. The paper concludes with a discussion of one of the plausibility problems with the `consistency conjectures' which attempt to address some of the apparently paradoxical consequences of time travel.</field><field name="date">2007-04-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252007-193645/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MicroRNAs in the spleen and liver of the developing chick embryo.</field><field name="creator">Hicks, Julie Ann</field><field name="description">MicroRNAs are small (~19-24nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in the regulation of gene expression. They are mainly expressed in development and many are expressed in a temporal as well as, a spatial manner. It is thought they may regulate up to 30% of all genes. Pyrosequencing using 454 Life Science technology is becoming the preferred method for microRNA profiling ad sequencing compared to the previous method of cloning and using traditional sequencing techniques. Use of 454 Life Sciences technology allows for a greater coverage of microRNAs and increases the chances of sequence low abundance microRNAs. In the current project we created four small RNA libraries from embryonic chick tissues, the spleen and liver at developmental time points E15 and E20. These libraries were then sequenced using 454 Life Sciences pyrosequencing. A total of 92,919 sequence reads were obtained, representing a total of 52,001 known chicken microRNAs. Of these 92,919 reads, 52,001 represented miRNAs matching the miRBase G. gallus database, and 3,472 were not found in the G. gallus database but were homologues of miRBase miRNAs from other species. Of these homologous reads 391 represented potential novel miRNAs. Other small RNAs, such as tRNA and rRNA, represented 24,672 of the reads, and 12,383 reads represented other types of sequences, such as degraded mRNA. More than one hundred different known miRNAs were identified in this study, and many were expressed in all four libraries. Common miRNAs that yielded multiple reads from all four libraries included miR-125b and miR-21, which are involved in general processes of cellular proliferation. Overall, the spleen libraries had a larger array of miRNAs than the liver libraries. Much of spleen development occurs during the later stages of embryonic development, so we can reasonably expect that many gene expression changes occur during these stages. As a result of this study, we identified nine potential novel chicken miRNAs. These novel miRNAs appear to be tissue-specific. The potential novel miRNAs appeared to be expressed at lower levels than some of the known miRNAs, which could indicate that most of the highly-expressed chicken miRNAs have already been identified, whereas, for the most part, the miRNAs expressed at low levels remain to be discovered.</field><field name="date">2007-05-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252007-215944/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dynamically pressurized heart model to facilitate the development of surgical tools and techniques for mitral valve repair.</field><field name="creator">Richards, Andrew Latimer</field><field name="description">BACKGROUND: The development of a novel surgical tool or technique used in mitral valve repair can be hampered by the cost, complexity, and time associated with performing animal trials. We sought to develop a dynamically pressurized model which detects and quantifies mitral regurgitation in intact porcine hearts in order to preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of mitral valve repair methods without the need for animal trials. METHODS: A computer controlled pulse duplication system was designed to accept freshly explanted porcine hearts and replicate a wide range of physiological conditions. To test the capabilities of this system in measuring mitral regurgitation, the cardiac output of four hearts was measured under two different peak left atrial pressures (120 and 150 mmHg) before and after induced mitral valve failures. Measurements were compared with clinically standard echocardiographic images. RESULTS: For all trials, cardiac output decreased as peak left atrial pressure was increased. After induction of mitral valve insufficiencies, cardiac output decreased, with a peak regurgitant fraction of 27%. These findings correlated well with the results from echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting system is able to consistently and reliably detect and quantify mitral regurgitation and serves as an effective tool for the design of mitral valve repair techniques. The system is advantageous in its low experimental cost and time associated with each trial, while still allowing for surgical evaluations in an intact heart.</field><field name="date">2008-03-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252008-113805/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and Structural Characterization of Proteins Involved in Bacterial Adaptive Responses</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Daniel Michael</field><field name="description">Bacteria are remarkable in their ability to adapt to environmental conditions that are continually in flux between growth-promoting and growth-limiting. Responses to a host of environmental situations are equally varied, ranging from the secretion of antimicrobial compounds and polymer degrading enzymes, to the up-regulation of alternative cellular developmental pathways leading to complete physiological transformation. In endospore forming bacteria this results in a metabolically inert, yet highly resistant endospore. The first study presented here deals with the NMR structural and dynamic characterization of a class of proteins in Bacillus subtilis known as transition-state regulators, responsible for global gene regulation during the transition from the vegetative mode of growth to the semi-quiescent stationary phase. The utilization of protein-DNA docking protocols further allows for the first description of a structural model for the interaction between these DNA-binding proteins and a cognate DNA promoter sequence. The later portions of this dissertation deal with the characterization of proteins involved in the ubiquitous bacterial signal transduction system known as the two-component signal transduction pathway. In the basic two-component signal transduction paradigm, an environmental signal is detected by a multi-domain sensor kinase that, via phosphorylation, activates a response regulator protein for its cellular role (be it DNA-binding, RNA-binding, enzymatic, etc). In the second study, a comparative modeling analysis of the predicted receiver domains the response regulators from Vibrio vulnificus YJ016 was performed, using the hydrophobic characteristics of the response regulator surface known to interact with the four-helix bundle of the cognate sensor kinase as the basis for sub-classification. In the final study, a new mass spectrometric technique to detail the structural changes in proteins resulting from oxidative damage was applied to the single domain response regulator Spo0F from B. subtilis.</field><field name="date">2008-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Functional Genomics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252008-122146/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of a Flexible DSP Based Controller Hardware System for Power Electronics Applications</field><field name="creator">Godbole, Rahul Pushpak</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes the concept of a universal controller hardware system for power electronics applications. With the presence of generic interfaces and communication schemes, this system can be used in various other control scenarios. A prototype hardware system incorporating a high performance floating point digital signal processor (DSP) and a powerful field programmable gate array (FPGA) has been built to demonstrate the concept of real-time hardware simulation. Prior to being deployed for control of a complete power electronics system, an intermediate step that would yield more information pertaining to system timing is the hardware simulation enabled by such a board. Extracting maximum throughput from this system with a few innovative schemes has been another goal of this project. In order to achieve this objective, the embedded peripherals of the Texas Instruments C6000 series DSP have been programmed to facilitate a higher degree of parallelism. The core of this thesis deals with the different sub-systems that comprise the real-time controller (RTC) board, and their interaction with one another. One of the novel schemes proposed in this thesis involves the on-board communication between the DSP and several analog-to-digital converter (ADC) chips using the multi-channel audio serial port (McASP) peripheral. The efficacy of this concept is made possible by robust software architecture, enabled by the enhanced direct memory access (EDMA) peripheral. In addition to the DSP peripheral activity, significant processing capability is offered by the Cyclone II series FPGA. The option of universal connectivity is provided over either Ethernet or USB. The FPGA also provides a platform for developing a complete system with an embedded 32-bit processor. The RTC board prototype can be used for power electronics applications with the addition of certain interface boards, which can be readily developed.</field><field name="date">2008-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252008-173146/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First year growth response to mulching with on-farm wastes in an oak-pine-soybean agroforestry trial</field><field name="creator">Stevenson, Hayley Diana</field><field name="description">Alley cropping may prove useful in the southeast U.S., providing multiple products and income streams, as well as affording sustainable land use alternatives to conventional farming and forest planting. Such systems in this region are of particular interest because they can help in soil conservation and nutrient retention and aid in sustaining and improving valued but degraded farmland. In the current study triple row single-species strips of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and cherrybark oak (Quercus pagoda) were planted as 1-year-old seedlings separated by 12 or 24 m wide areas of soybean in spring 2007. Select individual tree seedlings of each species were treated with on-farm wastes, used as mulch in a circular area around each stem. These waste/mulches were hog bedding (corn stover + hog waste removed from swine houses), old hay (year-old rolled/slightly spoiled bermudagrass hay - Cynodon dactylon) and black plastic bedding film. After the first season of growth with the applied mulches, tree seedling growth rates were higher for cherrybark oak and longleaf pine seedlings mulched with old hay applied at 7.5 cm deep in 30 cm radius around each seedling. Other mulches had varying effects on soil conditions, but no significant impact on tree growth as compared to the untreated control seedlings. These first-year findings suggest that mulching with specific on-farm wastes may be a valuable management tool in temperate alley cropping systems. Longer term tree growth in this system and with regard to these initial mulching treatments will be studied.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252009-104003/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Online Educational Social Networking in a School Environment.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Bethany Virginia</field><field name="description">The purpose of this mixed-methods research study was to investigate the use of a closed social network, utilizing Ning, in an online educational environment.

We then perform a systematic comparison of the production planning models incorporating the clearing functions with the conventional linear programming models for production planning under different scenarios.

Each transition state regulator binds multiple DNA targets with affinity in the nanomolar range, in spite of not recognizing a consensus sequence. Structural studies of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain have revealed a mechanism by which the proteins bind DNA, however, to date no NMR structure of a full-length transition state regulator exists. AbrB is the most well-characterized transition state regulator, and homologs are found in both Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis. The sequences of AbrB from B. subtilis and B. anthracis are overall 85% identical, and understanding the sequence differences from a structural standpoint is key to understanding the function of each protein. The far-UV circular dichroism spectra of each were deconvoluted using a number of programs, and the estimates of secondary structure content compared to the predictions by PSIPRED. Multiple NMR experiments were performed in order to assign the backbone chemical shifts of AbrB from both B. subtilis and B. anthracis. Chemical shift analysis has recently proven to be a powerful tool to investigate protein structure, providing information on backbone dihedral angles, aromatic ring orientation and other parameters. A comparative analysis of the homologous proteins was undertaken by determining the change in chemical shifts (&#206;&#206;&#180;) of conserved residues. The Chemical Shift Index (CSI) was used to determine the secondary structure of AbrB based on chemical shift information. Results show that the N-terminal DNA-binding domain adopts the same structure as observed in the NMR structure of the isolated AbrB DNA-binding domain. The appearance of the TROSYs indicates that neither AbrBBA nor AbrBBS adopts a largely random coil structure, and likely contains the C-terminal &#206;&#177;-helix predicted by PSIPRED.</field><field name="date">2009-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252009-143618/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-Punctuation Politics: The Evolution of Charter School Policy in North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Wayne D Jr</field><field name="description">This qualitative case study examines the evolution of charter school policy in North Carolina. The study is theoretically grounded in Baumgartner and Jones&#226; (1993) punctuated equilibrium theory. First, the study explores the evolution of charter school policy in North Carolina since the passage of charter school legislation in 1996. Second, it tests Lacireno-Paquet and Holyoke&#226;s (2007) hypothesis of policy reversion following the enactment of dramatic new policies. The study&#226;s findings indicate that since the passage of charter school legislation, traditional public school interests in North Carolina, led by the North Carolina Association of Educators, have regained a position of dominance in education policy making. Traditional public school interests&#226; access to Democratic legislators in the General Assembly has been instrumental in blocking amendments to charter school policy that would raise or remove the statewide cap of 100 charter schools. As such, the study&#226;s findings support Lacireno-Paquet and Holyoke&#226;s hypothesis of policy reversion.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Research and Policy Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252009-163200/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Other Side of the Story: Vietnam Escalation and Global Army Readiness, 1965-1968</field><field name="creator">Dempsey, Christopher Martin</field><field name="description">From 1965-1968, the United States Army bore the brunt of President Lyndon B.

This paper examines the devastating effects of escalation in Southeast Asia on the army&#226;s ability to remain prepared and ready to fight another war should one arise anywhere else in the world. Specifically, it traces the downward trend of army readiness as a result of Johnson&#226;s decision not to call up the reserves until 1968, paired with the rapid expansion of the army from 1 million soldiers in 1965 to 1.5 million in 1968.</field><field name="date">2009-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252009-172131/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agents of Change?

The Plantation Landscape and the Challenge of Inclusive Museum Narration.</field><field name="creator">Adams, Robyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Visitors to historic plantation house museums may come for tours of grand manor houses, stories of elite white history, and expensive decorative arts, but once they step outside the main house they are confronted with numerous outbuildings which were once the work and living spaces of enslaved men and women. Perhaps the most popular outbuilding with visitors today, the detached kitchen is the focal point of my study into the interpretations of space at historic house museums. More commonly found at historic sites than smokehouses, privies, and dairies, the detached kitchen has become the primary venue for the incorporation of slavery into the master site narratives. As scholars of plantation landscapes have shown, the detachment of the kitchen was a purposeful choice made by white elites in an effort to control the access enslaved workers had to areas of the white family. This racial segregation meant a plantation household was really a series of households, and my paper argues that the architectural legacy of the kitchen&#226;s detachment from the house complicates the very ability of a site to incorporate and interpret the social structures of the plantation into one inclusive narrative. This paper focuses on Gunston Hall Plantation in Mason&#226;s Neck, Virginia, Tryon Palace in New Bern, NC, and Mordecai Historic Site in Raleigh, NC to highlight the ways the kitchen is interpreted through both the regular tours and special programming.</field><field name="date">2010-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252010-152245/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Naturalized Citizens: Conservation, Gender, and the Tennessee Valley Authority during the New Deal</field><field name="creator">Bradshaw, Laura Hepp</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the conservation movement, particularly in regards to hydroelectric power, from the Progressive Era through the New Deal.

A new approach to combine multiple GCMs is proposed by analyzing the skill of candidate models contingent on the relevant predictor(s) state. To demonstrate this approach, we combine historical simulations of winter (December-February, DJF) precipitation and temperature from seven GCMs by evaluating their skill &#226; represented by Mean Square Error (MSE) &#226; over similar predictor (DJF Nino3.4) conditions. The MSE estimates are converted into weights for each GCM for developing multimodel tercile probabilities. A total of six multimodel schemes are considered that includes combinations based on pooling of ensembles as well as based on the long-term skill of the models. To ensure the improved skill exhibited by the multimodel scheme is statistically significant, we perform rigorous hypothesis tests comparing the skill of multimodels with individual models&#226; skill. The multimodel combination contingent on Nino3.4 show improved skill particularly for regions whose winter precipitation and temperature exhibit significant correlation with Nino3.4. Analyses of weights also show that the proposed multimodel combination methodology assigns higher weights for GCMs and lesser weights for climatology during El Nino and La Nina conditions. On the other hand, due to the limited skill of GCMs during neutral conditions over the tropical Pacific, the methodology assigns higher weights for climatology resulting in improved skill from the multimodel combinations. Thus, analyzing GCMs&#226; skill contingent on the relevant predictor state provide an alternate approach for multimodel combination such that years with limited skill could be replaced with climatology.</field><field name="date">2010-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03252010-193310/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Novice to Expert: The Professional Development of School Counselors</field><field name="creator">Potts, Barbara</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to examine the tasks undertaken at different stages of professional development by school counselors and their perceived importance of those tasks.

Participants were 102 sixth-grade children from two local middle schools and one of their parents (n = 82). Children were interviewed about their implicit theories about relationships, the causes of and frequency, duration, and intensity of their jealousy toward a sibling, and their coping strategies in response to a recalled sibling jealousy event. Parents completed questionnaires regarding their beliefs about children?s emotions, their reactions to their own children?s negative emotion expression, and their demographics. Parents? beliefs that negative emotions are good and parents? problem-focused and encouraging expression reactions were positively related to children?s implicit theories about parents, and to the duration and intensity of sibling jealousy. Parents? encouraging reactions were negatively related to children?s passive/avoidant coping with jealousy. Also, children?s implicit theories about parents were positively related to children?s duration and intensity of jealousy, behavioral action coping, and negatively related to children?s passive/avoidant coping. Findings suggest that parent socialization is important in the development of children?s implicit theories, as well as children?s jealousy experiences and coping strategies.</field><field name="date">2006-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262006-161908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon, chloride, and oxygen isotopes as tracers of interbasin groundwater flow at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica</field><field name="creator">Webb, Mathew Douglas</field><field name="description">Groundwater and surface water samples were taken at 14 locations at a lowland rainforest site (La Selva Biological Station) in Costa Rica for the analysis of DIC, DOC, 14C, 13C, 36Cl, 18O, and other geochemical parameters. The data are consistent with the mixing of two endmember groundwaters. One is a local water having low Cl concentrations (&lt;0.07 mM), low DIC (&lt;3.0 mM), high 14C (&gt;100 pmc), &#948;13C between -22? and -26?, and highly variable 36Cl/Cl ratios. This chemistry is consistent with locally recharged shallow groundwaters having short residence times in which the DIC originates from plant root respiration and atmospheric deposition is the only source of Cl. The other endmember is bedrock groundwater, representing interbasin groundwater flow (IGF) into La Selva and having relatively high Cl concentration (&gt;0.9 mM), high DIC (about 14 mM), low 14C (&lt;8 pmc), high &#948;13C (-3? to -5?), and a low and more consistent 36Cl/Cl ratio. This chemistry is consistent with the expectations for bedrock groundwater recharged on the flanks of Volcan Barva to the north of La Selva, with a majority of the DIC and Cl derived from magmatic degassing and dissolution of the volcanic rocks that make up the aquifer. A 14C age of 750 ? 4650 years before present was estimated for the bedrock groundwater endmember using NETPATH geochemical mass-balance modeling software, suggesting an average linear velocity of 3-20 m/yr for this groundwater; the actual age is probably closer to the upper limit, and velocity closer to the lower limit. The results of this study are consistent with prior work using major ion, 18O, and physical hydrologic data, suggesting that the conclusions about IGF and groundwater mixing at this site are correct. Also, new DIC data for bedrock groundwater and previous hydrologic data on bedrock groundwater inputs to the Arboleda watershed at La Selva suggest that IGF of bedrock groundwater is responsible for a large inorganic carbon flux into lowland watersheds (about 740 grams of carbon per m2 of watershed each year for the Arboleda).</field><field name="date">2007-04-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262007-111350/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximizing Multisource Feedback: The Use of Goal Setting to Facilitate Performance Improvement</field><field name="creator">Baker, Rebecca A.</field><field name="description">The present study examined a theoretical model representing the relationship between multisource feedback and performance change.

The effects of the embedded optical fibers on the host material and their interaction with each other are first considered on both a micro- and macro-mechanics scale. The mechanical low-velocity impact response of two-dimensional woven composite laminates with and without various densities of embedded optical fibers is therefore investigated. Modifications to the specimen fabrication process are then developed to facilitate the embedment of a large density of optical fibers. The light transmission capabilities of embedded optical fibers are also studied to demonstrate that the current fabrication processes permits sufficient light transmission to allow interrogation of the embedded FBG sensor network. The FBG sensor network is finally embedded in a woven composite sample which is then subjected to multiple low velocity impacts events until complete failure of the material system. The FBG sensor data is collected after each impact event, providing a map of the internal strain field in the composite through the progression of damage until failure of the laminate.</field><field name="date">2007-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262007-144306/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Models for Insect Mortality Due to Exposure to Insecticides</field><field name="creator">Joyner, Sarah Lynn</field><field name="description">Chemical pesticides have long been used to control insect populations on field crops, and their widespread availability and ease of manipulation present an ideal system for the exploration of the relationship between vital rates and population dynamics. Research has shown that models of population effects of insecticides are more accurate when time-varying parameters are used, but the scientific community has been slow to accept such models, which may involve complicated mathematics such as partial differential equations. Additionally, many of the pesticides now in use have both acute and sublethal effects, and these differing modes of action, along with concerns for the scientific community's understanding of the models, motivate a new approach to mathematical modeling of the effects of insecticides on population dynamics. We first consider an ordinary differential equation model, which, while simple, provides highly accurate fits to population data, though it accounts for only one generation at a time without explicitly considering reproductive effects. An evaluation of the effects of insecticides on insect fecundity is considered separately. We then develop, implement, and analyze a coupled time-delay differential equation model, which incorporates information for multiple generations and is an intermediate model in terms of ease of understanding for non-mathematicians. Sensitivity results for the time delay kernel are also presented.</field><field name="date">2008-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computational Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262008-150916/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Logistical Model for Closed Loop Recycling of Textile Materials</field><field name="creator">Woolard, Ryan</field><field name="description">In the United States alone, people consume and discard over 500 billion pounds of wastes annually. Wastes discarded in landfills create threats to land, air, and water, but also represent lost resources. Recycling has the ability to divert wastes from landfills and recover precious raw materials. However, recycling activities are only as efficient as the reverse logistics and supply chains that support them. These areas are relatively new, but successful implementations have real benefits for companies in terms of profits and environmental goodwill. Many companies are creating closed loop supply chains where forward and reverse activities are interlinked in cyclical processes. Ideally, a virgin input enters the system only once and is recycled forever. The problem with most current closed loop supply chains is that they are product-specific. When a closed-loop supply chain is designed, the product must be designed so that it can easily be recycled back into the supply chain. The problem is that the product must contain a minimum number of dissimilar components. For textile products, this presents a real challenge because of fiber blends and finishes that make component separation difficult. These problems create the need to design textile recycling systems. This research focuses on the logistical systems necessary to recycle textile materials. Methodologies for estimating post-consumer carpet (PCC) returns and trailer loading capacities are first discussed, followed by location allocation models that determine the geographical placement of recycling sites of an existing carpet collection network. The location allocation model utilizes zip code populations to allocate percentages of the PCC returns to the collection sites. The population for each site is determined by summing the five-digit zip code populations within a specified collection radius. The collection site weight is then calculated as the percentage of the total population for the collection network. A proposed national network model, based on three-digit zip codes, has also been developed. This model includes economies of scale for recycling processing costs. Increasing annual returns have been modeled to study the effects of changing network morphologies on the location and allocation of recycling sites. A PCC reverse supply chain cost model is also presented to study the cost relationships of the activities that comprise the recycling network. Transportation costs from the location allocation models were utilized in the model, as well as cost data from industry. It was found that processing costs are the main drivers in a nylon 6 recycling network, while a nylon 6,6 network is sensitive to cost changes in any reverse activity. Quantified results show that either recycling technologies must become more efficient or virgin nylon prices must increase for recycled nylon to be competitive with virgin polymers.</field><field name="date">2009-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262009-143230/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Variable Selection</field><field name="creator">Schumann, David Heinz</field><field name="description">The prevalence of extreme outliers in many regression data sets has led to the development of robust methods that can handle these observations. While much attention has been placed on the problem of estimating regression coefficients in the presence of outliers, few methods address variable selection. We develop and study robust versions of the forward selection algorithm, one of the most popular standard variable selection techniques. Specifically we modify the VAMS procedure, a version of forward selection tuned to control the false selection rate, to simultaneously select variables and eliminate outliers. In an alternative approach, robust versions of the forward selection algorithm are developed using the robust forward addition sequence associated with the generalized score statistic. Combining the robust forward addition sequence with robust versions of BIC and the VAMS procedure, a final model is obtained. Monte Carlo simulation compares these robust methods to current robust methods like the LSA and LAD-LASSO. Further simulation investigates the relationship between the breakdown point of the estimation methods central to each procedure and the breakdown point of the final variable selection method.</field><field name="date">2009-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262009-153524/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eye Movements Between Text and Warnings in Product Owner&#226;s Manuals</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Jennifer Antonia</field><field name="description">This research examines some design features that may increase noticeability, readership and recall of warnings within the text of product owner&#226;s manuals. Variables manipulated were warning saliency (e.g., low or high saliency), the physical placement of warnings in text (e.g., embedded versus separate), and text-directed cueing (e.g., low versus high salient cueing) in a fractional factorial design. Warnings were made salient by adding signal word panel color, alert symbol icons, bulleted text and black borders. Low salient warnings lacked those features and the warning was given in paragraph prose-style text. Two conditions, a non-eye tracked and an eye-tracked, underwent similar procedures to assess reading and recall of the warning information. Six groups comprised the non-eye tracked sample: each group viewed a unique condition with a unique combination of warning features. The eye-tracked sample viewed 2 opposing conditions with warning feature combinations that comprised a low and high salient condition. While there were no significant group differences in warning information recall accuracy in the non-eye tracked samples, the low salient conditions in the eye-tracked samples had higher recall accuracy than the high salient conditions. Also, the high salient conditions with high salient cues, significantly shifted visual attention to cued warnings more often than the low salient conditions with low salient cues. However, the eye-tracked sample failed to show significance differences for noticing and reading between low and high salient conditions. In addition, the assessment of the first three fixations indicated that participants may initially scan page contents before reading onset at the top left corner of the page, however fixation locations were not influenced by warning locations. Future research directions and study implications are addressed.</field><field name="date">2009-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262009-203635/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Casualties of a Radicalizing Cuban Revolution: Middle-Class Opposition and Exile, 1961-1968</field><field name="creator">Loiacano, Catherine Lynn</field><field name="description">This study explores the major factors contributing to the exodus of the Cuban middle class from 1961 to 1968. For the purpose of this study, the heterogeneous middle class is broken up into middle-class students, professionals, and businessmen. Each of these groups had slightly different values and motivations, yet large percentages of each left Cuba as the revolution radicalized, changing economic, political and social life for all Cubans. In explaining this phenomenon, this paper follows the relationship between Cuba and the United States, focusing particularly on the conflictive dialogue that emerged between Fidel Castro and the US presidents of the 1960&#226;s. In addition, the role of each government in facilitating the exodus must be considered, necessitating attention to US special treatment toward Cuban immigrants. Ultimately, this study asserts that various radicalizations in revolutionary Cuba from the declaration of socialism in April 1961 to the final revolutionary offensive of 1968 pushed the middle class to the United States. Unlike the middles classes of 1940s Costa Rica and Guatemala, they chose to leave in order to retain their standard of living rather than to sacrifice in order for the lower classes to benefit.</field><field name="date">2010-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262010-104219/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal Transfer in Semiconductor Nano Structures</field><field name="creator">Kong, Byoung-Don</field><field name="description">We present the results of theoretical investigation of thermal energy transfer in nanoscale semiconductors. The study mainly focuses on the newly discovered nano scale phenomena. First, we investigate near field thermal emission characteristics from semiconductors/vacuum interfaces with resonantly excited surface phonon polaritons and surface plasmon polaritons. All of the studied materials, InP, GaAs, GaN, SiC, and sapphire which support surface phonon polariton excitations, exhibit quasimonochromatic thermal emission symbolized by strong peaks of evanescent modes at well-defined frequencies in the near field that correspond to the appropriate peaks in the density of states for surface phonon polaritons. It is also found that the materials with lower polariton frequencies (e.g., InP and GaAs) generally demonstrate a higher peak spectral energy density compared to those with higher frequencies (e.g., SiC). This trend is maintained over the entire range of temperature (300-&#226;600 K) and the distance from the surface (&lt;10 um) considered in the calculation. The energy density stored in the evanescent peaks, when close to the surface, is estimated to be many orders of magnitude larger than that in the blackbody radiation. Surface plasmon polariton excitations are studied with n-doped GaAs, GaN, and Si. The study shows that the characteristic plasma and surface plasmon polariton resonant frequencies in the interval from 0.3 THz to 10 THz can be controlled with conventional doping densities. All considered demonstrate the spectral energy density in the near field that is several orders of magnitude larger than the blackbody radiation. The strongly resonant surface polariton excitations are also shown to enhance drastically the radiative heat transfer between two semi-infinite surfaces separated by nanometric distances. The possibility of extending spatially coherent emission through a 1-D binary grating is examined based on a rigorous coupled wave analysis. It is shown that spatially coherent thermal emission can be achieved using properly designed grating structures. Thermal emission properties are further investigated with more complex structures in one dimensional photonic crystals using Green's dyadic tensor and the concept of local electromagnetic density of states. The results show that high density near-field energy can be transfered via surface wave coupling across the one dimensional photonic crystals so it can be used as energy transfer mechanism without thermal and electric conduction. To explore future possibilities of active terahertz generation, the stimulated and spontaneous interactions were studied using photon-phonon interaction Hamiltonian and it is shown that there exist stimulated interactions. The energy transfer by the conduction mechanism is also studied with low dimensional crystal structures. We investigate the lattice thermal conductivity of ideal monolayer and bilayer graphene, using calculations from first principles. Our result estimates that the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both is around 2200 W/mK at 300 K, a value close to the one observed theoretically and experimentally in graphite along the basal plane. It also illustrates the expected 1/T dependence at higher temperatures. The minor variation between monolayer and bilayer thermal conductivity suggests that the number of layers may not affect significantly the in-plane thermal properties of these systems. The intrinsic thermal conductivity also appears to be nearly isotropic for graphene.</field><field name="date">2010-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262010-113742/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Systematics of Philadelphus and Molecular Evolution of LFY in the Core Eudicots</field><field name="creator">Guo, Yuelong</field><field name="description">Phylogenetic analysis is a powerful tool for elucidate evolutionary relationships of organisms and genes and for testing taxonomic and evolutionary hypotheses. I conducted phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from five gene regions to evaluate the classification scheme of Philadelphus and used phylogenetic analysis to provide a framework for examining molecular evolution of the LFY gene in plants. Results from my study suggested that Philadelphus is a paraphyletic group with the single species genus Carpenteria nested within. Three evolutionary distinct clades were identified in this large Carpenteria-Philadelphus complex, the subgenus Deutzoides clade, the genus Carpenteria clade, and the remaining Core-Philadelphus clade, each merits the recognition of a genus. Our results mostly agreed with the most recent treatment of genus Philadelphus on the placement of Deutzoides, with the exception of P. hirsutus. However, our result does not support the classification scheme proposed for the rest Philadelphus species. Biogeographic analysis using the Statistical Bayes-DIVA method (S-DIVA) and divergence time dating with the BEAST method resolved the origin of Philadelphus s. l. in southwestern North America in the Oligocene. Several intercontinental migrations from North America to Asia and to Europe occurred at the different times of the later Tertiary to reach a worldwide distribution of the genus. For the molecular evolution study of LFY gene, our results revealed that the evolution of LFY was under strong functional constraint, with the C domain under the strongest selection force and the intervening domain being the most relaxed. Our study also showed that the detection of positive selection using the Branch Site Model was robust to taxon sampling density, but sensitive to sequence length and alignment ambiguity. Our analyses under various conditions consistently detected positive selection in Fabaceae, where FLO/LFY evolved a role of the KNOX1 gene function in regulating compound leaf development. Under the best alignment, we detected adaptive selection at several sites in Asterales, Brassicaceae, and Fabaceae where gene duplication and/or novel function of LFY have been reported.</field><field name="date">2010-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262010-121851/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring Relational Communication Patterns in Preferral Intervention Teams</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Megan S</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to understand the relational communication patterns that characterize school-based prereferral intervention teams (PITs). Prior research has suggested that although many states either require or recommend PITs, little is known about what occurs during PIT meetings (Truscott, Cohen, Sams, Sanborn, &amp; Frank, 2005). A relational communication perspective emphasizes that within interpersonal interactions (such as those that occur in group-based situations), speakers are constantly redefining their roles, positions, and relationship through conversations (Erchul, Grissom, &amp; Getty, 2008). A popular way of studying relational communication in dyadic or group situations is through coding systems such as the Family Relational Communication Control Coding System (FRCCCS; Heatherington &amp; Friedlander, 1989). In this study, 15 PIT meetings were used as the basis of analyses and each meeting was audiotaped, transcribed, and coded using the FRCCCS. Additionally, each coder completed the PIT Meeting Evaluation Coding Sheet that assessed participants&#226; adherence to a traditional problem-solving framework. Important results included: (a) relatively consistent domineeringness (i.e., attempted influence) scores, with the exception of the referring teacher; (b) overall relatively consistent dominance (i.e., successful influence) scores; (b) significantly greater (p &lt; .05) domineeringness by the school psychologist when compared to the referring teacher; and (c) no significant differences in dominance scores between the school psychologist and teacher. In sum, the current study represents an important first step in understanding communication patterns in school-based groups, which will continue to be important as schools transition to using response-to-intervention (RTI) models of service delivery.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262010-134940/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politics of the Black Flag: Guerrilla Memory and Southern Conservatism in the New South</field><field name="creator">Hulbert, Matthew C.</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the intersection of Civil War memory and the history of conservative politics in the New South through two critical phases and its historiographic context. Phase one examines the partisan constructs of guerrilla honor, defeat, and extra-legal violence presented in Noted Guerrillas, Or, The Warfare of the Border (1877) by fire-eating Democratic newspaperman John Newman Edwards. Through his creation of &#226;guerrilla memory,&#226; Edwards kindled a significant counter-narrative to traditional strands of early-Lost Cause mythology. More importantly, by harnessing class-based bushwhacker imagery and violence, Edwards expanded the socio-economic reach of the conservative Lost Cause and adjoined a newly important political function to social memory during Reconstruction. Phase two addresses broader concepts of race, gender, citizenship, and commemoration by tracing how guerrilla memory and its bushwhackers-turned-authors adapted to shifting standards of conservatism in the New South and attempted to situate themselves snugly within its elite ranks. While highlighting how turn-of-the-century bushwhacker memoirs adapted to increasingly powerful women, subsequent wars, and changing racial attitudes, practical light is also shed on the fundamental processes of memory itself&#226;that is, the theoretical means by which strains of memory are created, updated, and even destroyed. Finally, this thesis includes a sweeping historiographic analysis of guerrilla memory; how historians and propagandists waged a partisan struggle over the memory of William C. Quantrill as an avenue to controlling guerrilla memory as a whole; and how the fallout from this debate shaped&#226;for better and worse&#226;the study of Confederate guerrillas for decades. In the process of surveying these sources, methodological conclusions regarding the treatment of primary materials, allegedly &#226;tainted&#226; by the forces of social memory, are also addressed and put to rest. Overall, &#226;Politics of the Black Flag: Guerrilla Memory and Southern Conservatism in the New South&#226; seeks to illuminate that deeper understanding of the ways in which southern conservatism has been remembered will, in turn, lead to equally better understanding of the forces and environment that shaped it.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03262010-202225/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Phrygian Sonnet: The Effects of Using Music to Teach a Seventh Grade Poetry Unit</field><field name="creator">Salyers, Bethany Lyn</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to understand what occurred when music was infused into a seventh grade poetry unit. Music was used as a co-text in this study, meaning that it was given equal time, energy, and respect as the poetry used in the unit. The unit was nineteen days long, during which, students learned about narrative, free verse, and lyrical poetry. The students also learned about author's intent, language use, mood, metaphor, interpretation, and the role of the audience. During this unit, the students completed two projects that allowed for students to choose to work with either poetry or lyrics. While the use of music caused no significant growth in content knowledge, there was no negative learning effect either. Students found the unit to be engaging and appreciated the amount of choice given to them. Teacher observations, along with student statements, conclude that the use of music raised interest levels in the poetry unit and made the unit fun. The students also noted that a variety of lesson structure played a positive role in the overall effectiveness of the unit. The issues that were raised in the implementation of this study pertain to the allowance of explicit lyrics, time constraints, and managing the duel roles as both teacher and researcher. Finally, the teacher gained new insights into her teaching and came up with several recommendations for future implementation.</field><field name="date">2003-03-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum and Instruction, English Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272003-002314/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Site-to-site rate variation in protein coding genes</field><field name="creator">Mannino, Frank Vincent</field><field name="description">The ability to realistically model gene evolution improved dramatically with the rejection of the assumption that rates are constant across sites. Rate heterogeneity models allow for better estimates of parameters and site specific inferences such as the detection of positive selection. Recently developed models of codon evolution allow for both synonymous and nonsynonymous rates to vary independently according to discretized gamma distributions. I applied this model to mitochondrial genomes and concluded that synonymous rate variation is present in many genes, and is of appreciable magnitude relative to the amount of nonsynonymous heterogeneity. I then extending this model to allow for the two rates to vary according to a dependent bivariate distribution, permitting tests for the significance of correlation of rates within a gene. I present here the algorithm to discretize this bivariate distribution and the application of the model to many real data sets. Significant correlation between synonymous and nonsynonymous rates exists in roughly half of the data sets that I examined, and the correlation is typically positive. These data sets range over a wide group of taxa and genes, implying that the trend of correlation is general. Finally, I performed a thorough investigation of the statistical properties of using discretized gamma distributions to model rate variation, looking at the bias and variance in parameter estimates. These discretized distributions are common in modeling heterogeneity, but have weaknesses that must be well understood before making inferences.</field><field name="date">2006-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272006-140300/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Implementation of &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt;: Test-Bed for Bidding Agents in Online Auction Markets.</field><field name="creator">Singh, Ratna</field><field name="description">Online auctions provide a very competitive market for a variety of goods and services and have gained a lot of popularity over the last few years. The increasing participation of buyers and sellers in these auctions has triggered the development of software bidding agents. These agents are automated agents that are designed to place bids on behalf of the user. In recent years, simulation of online auction markets has become a major research area in the field of electronic commerce. This is because testing different bidding strategies in a real auction environment involves risks and can result in heavy losses. Moreover, testing in a real life auction involves substantial amount of time and participation, in order to derive a definite conclusion about the bidding agent?s performance. We propose to solve this problem by designing and implementing a tool for simulating online auction markets. Our simulation tool called &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; can be configured to develop test scenarios for testing bidding agent strategies. Currently, &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; supports the reserve price auction mechanism found on eBay. However, support for other auction mechanisms can be easily integrated with &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; in the future. We have designed &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; to offer two modes of simulating auction environments for testing bidding strategies: event-based and clock-based. Event-based simulation is used to obtain a quicker analysis of the bidding agent?s performance, by moving forward to each event rather than moving linearly by the clock. In contrast, the clock-based simulation offers to test and gauge a bidding agent?s performance in an auction environment where time moves linearly by the clock similar to real life online auctions. A key characteristic of &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; is that it tests bidding agent?s strategies against real eBay data on completed auctions. Therefore, the results obtained by testing bidding strategy in &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; give a better insight into its anticipated performance in a real life online auction. Overall, &lt;i&gt;fauxBay&lt;/i&gt; is designed to be extensible, configurable and give close to realistic results on the performance of bidding agents.</field><field name="date">2006-04-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272006-234545/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control Authorities of a Distributed Actuation and Sensing Array on a Blended-Wing-Body Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle</field><field name="creator">Lion, Stephen Todd</field><field name="description">A distributed actuation array was installed on a blended-wing-body uninhabited aerial vehicle and tested in the 12-foot subsonic wind tunnel at NASA?s Langley Research Center.

Each effector in the distributed array was tested individually as well as pre-determined configurations incorporating all 12 effectors on each wing. From the tests on the individual effectors, a method was created that allows for the prediction of the control authorities for any configuration of the array. The six pre-determined shapes served as bases for comparison to determine the accuracy of the prediction scheme. Additionally, the shapes were compared to the conventional control surfaces to determine if a distributed array could completely replace those control surfaces.</field><field name="date">2007-04-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272007-011124/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wikis in the Teaching of Writing: Purposes for Implementation</field><field name="creator">Coley, Toby Franklin</field><field name="description">Throughout the documented history of the teaching of writing, educators have engaged in various methods through which to guide student learning in the textual medium.

The wiki has emerged as a growing technology with the potential to transform the rhetoric of the writing classroom. The present project seeks to further the research available on wikis in the teaching of writing. This study is both definitional and explorational. The questions it seeks to address include: how are wikis being used in educator?s classrooms; to what purposes are the wikis being used; in what ways are wikis being used? To answer some of these questions, various instructor survey responses were evaluated and incorporated into this thesis. The six main purposes for which wikis are being used in education that are identified in this study are 1) collaboration, 2) facilitation of work, 3) audience extension, 4) knowledge building/reflecting, 5) effective writing, and 6) multimodal literacy. After gathering data on the above purposes, this research discusses the results of the data and considers future research for integrating wiki technology into the teaching of writing.</field><field name="date">2007-05-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272007-092830/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus) Feeding Ecology and Potential Ecosystem Effects During Winter in North Carolina.</field><field name="creator">Butler, Christopher Matthew</field><field name="description">Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) occupy North Carolina waters during winter months. Their potential impact on prey populations during this time has largely been unexplored. Diet, prey-size selectivity, predator-prey size relationships, gastric evacuation rates, daily ration, and population-level predatory demand were estimated for Atlantic bluefin tuna in North Carolina during winter. Quantitative analyses of bluefin tuna stomachs collected from commercial fishers during two winters (2004-2005) were examined. Bluefin tuna diet was dominated by Atlantic menhaden with other teleosts, portunid crabs, and squid being of mostly minor importance. By weight, I found no major inter-annual differences in diet; however, intra-seasonal diet variability was evident with more diverse diets in late-fall and less diverse diets (predominantly Atlantic menhaden) during winter for one out of two years examined. Lengths of Atlantic menhaden collected from bluefin tuna stomachs were compared with lengths of Atlantic menhaden captured from the Atlantic menhaden purse seine fishery; no significant differences were observed suggesting no prey size selection. Minimum and median-sized Atlantic menhaden prey increased with increased bluefin tuna size, while maximum-sized Atlantic menhaden did not change. Diel patterns in mean gut fullness values were used to estimate the first known field derived gastric evacuation rate for this species. Daily ration from mean gut fullness values and gastric evacuation rates were used along with a range of bluefin tuna population sizes and residency to estimate population-level consumption by bluefin tuna on Atlantic menhaden. I found that, at current population levels, bluefin tuna predation on Atlantic menhaden is minimal relative to consumption of Atlantic menhaden by other known predators and commercial harvest. This was corroborated with an independent estimate of Atlantic menhaden consumption using an Ecopath model. Bluefin tuna appear to occupy coastal waters in North Carolina to prey upon Atlantic menhaden; thus, changes in the Atlantic menhaden stock status or distribution could alter winter foraging locations of bluefin tuna. This study has helped fill a gap in the knowledge of bluefin tuna natural history and provided data necessary for implementing multispecies fisheries management.</field><field name="date">2007-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272007-102659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Paul Laurence Dunbar: A Life and Career in Context</field><field name="creator">Gilroy, Joseph William</field><field name="description">Paul Laurence Dunbar was one of the most popular poets of his day.

However, despite Dunbar?s popularity, he has also been widely criticized for his black dialect poetry.

Exploratory analyses further revealed rank as a possible moderator of the relationship between gender attitudes and egalitarianism, and found gender identity to be a significant predictor of both as well. Limitations of the study as well as implications and direction for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272008-165520/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Cultural Cues on Perceptions Formed During Computer-Mediated Communication</field><field name="creator">Vignovic, Jane Ann</field><field name="description">Computer-mediated communication, such as e-mail, facilitates cross-cultural interactions by enabling convenient communication. However, the absence of contextual or situational information in e-mails may cause recipients to over rely on dispositional explanations for behavior. An experiment was conducted on 435 students examining how technical language violations (i.e., spelling and grammatical errors) and etiquette deviations from language norms (i.e., short messages lacking a conversational tone) affect a recipient&#226;s perceptions of an e-mail sender&#226;s conscientiousness, intelligence, agreeableness, extraversion, affective trustworthiness, and cognitive trustworthiness. This study also investigated whether the effects of technical and etiquette language violations depend on the availability of information indicating the e-mail sender is from a foreign culture. Participants&#226; causal uncertainty levels were examined as a potential moderator of the influence the provision of this additional contextual information had on the dependent variables. Results reveal that participants formed negative perceptions of the sender of an e-mail containing technical language violations. Specifically, perceptions of the sender&#226;s conscientiousness and intelligence were affected by technical language violations. However, these negative perceptions were reduced when the participants had additional information indicating that the e-mail sender was from a different culture. Meanwhile, negative attributions stemming from etiquette violations were not significantly mitigated by knowledge that the e-mail sender was from a foreign culture. Causal uncertainty had no significant effects. Implications for work organizations are discussed. Overall, it is argued that a greater understanding of cross-cultural communication via e-mail can aid in the development of appropriate training and tools to increase the success of communication within and between organizations.</field><field name="date">2008-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272008-223953/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disquiet</field><field name="creator">Michels, Kelly</field><field name="description">This is a collection of original poetry.</field><field name="date">2008-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272008-234451/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increasing Fertility in the Roman Late Republic and Early Empire</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Vanessa</field><field name="description">During the late Republic and early Empire, many Roman citizens emphasized their personal fertility and were concerned with increasing the citizen birthrate. The continuation of individual families, as well as the security of the Roman state and economy relied upon the existence of a stable population. Literary, medical, documentary and legal sources show a variety of political and social means that were employed by men and women of all classes to promote fertility. These means included legislation as well as an emphasis on the non-use of abortion. Medicine also played a role in increasing conception rates, through the involvement of physicians and reliance upon folk medicine. This research shows the critical importance of motherhood to Roman society during this period, and raises questions about the impact that the desire for fertility had upon Roman society.</field><field name="date">2009-04-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272009-111414/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Situ Conservation Through the Eyes of the Zoo Visitor: Examining Visitor Awareness and Support of the North Carolina Zoological Park&#226;s Participation in In Situ Conservation Projects</field><field name="creator">Cerbin, Adriana Cerbin Linda</field><field name="description">Zoo officials have for many years participated in ex situ conservation activities. Recently however, a growing number of zoos have shown an interest in becoming involved with in situ conservation projects. One such zoo is the North Carolina Zoological Park (NCZP) in Asheboro, NC. NCZP officials have committed to several of these projects and are aware of their importance. However, little is known about how visitors regard these activities. The two research questions asked were: 1) Are visitors aware of the NCZP&#226;s involvement in in situ conservation efforts? and 2) Do patrons&#226; of the NCZP support those efforts? Three hypotheses were identified. These included: H1: visitors with an increased awareness of the zoo&#226;s involvement in in situ conservation would provide a greater amount of support for these projects, H2: membership status would not affect a visitor&#226;s level of declared support for in situ conservation, and H3: membership status would affect a visitor&#226;s level of monetary support for in situ conservation. A survey instrument was developed using a cross-sectional design. The survey focused on four key elements including contributions (monetary support), declared support for local and international projects, understanding of in situ conservation, and visitor relationships with the zoo. The survey was conducted on-site at the NCZP in June and July 2007. Tests of statistical significance and measures of association indicated that awareness played a statistically significant role in how much declared support a visitor had for a project, but had little to no role in how much money visitors contributed on an annual basis. Findings also indicated that membership status was not related to declared support and therefore this relationship was not statistically significant. Finally findings indicated that the relationship between membership status and annual monetary contributions was statistically significant. Recommendations for the NCZP were made based on the study&#226;s findings.</field><field name="date">2009-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272009-144806/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediating Bone Mineralization Status in Laying Hens by Feeding Increased Calcium during Rearing and the Lay Cycle</field><field name="creator">Fosnaught, Mary Helen</field><field name="description">Trends to decrease the age of sexual maturity and point of lay without concurrent increases in dietary Ca may reduce the potential for full skeletal mineralization in pullets. During lay, the hen&#226;s increased genetic capacity to produce more eggs with less feed without respective increases in dietary Ca may further predispose hens to bone weakness leading to welfare and livability issues. Objectives of this research were to evaluate the effect of feeding increased calcium during rearing and the lay cycle as well as strain and density on laying hen performance and bone mineralization status. Pullets were grown to 16 wks in a grow house with 52 pullets/replicate and 28 replicates/treatment (5,824hens total) which were then moved to a lay house from 18-66 wks with either 24 or 36 hens/replicate (at 48 or 64 sq in) so that there was a total of 26 replicates/treatment (5,728 hens total). The 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments during rearing were Leghorns strain: Hy-Line W-36 (H) and Babcock B-300 (B) and Ca:P ratios: elevated (RC+) Ca:P 2.14, 3.14, 4.14 and control (RC) Ca:P 2.14, 2.14, 2.42 ratio of starter (0-6 weeks), grower (6-12 weeks), and developer (12-17 weeks), respectively. In the lay cycle, the 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial consisted of strain, rearing diet, layer dietary regimens: increasing Ca and P (LC+) and constant (LC) and cage densities: low, 64in2/bird (LD) and high, 48in2/bird (HD). All diets were isocaloric and fed ad libitum. Feed consumption (FC) and BW were monitored bi-weekly (by period) beginning at 2 weeks of age during the rearing and every 4 weeks during the layer phase. Mortality and egg production was recorded daily. During rearing, 5 femurs/trt and during laying, 3 femurs/trt were measured for dry fat-extracted bone weight (DFEW), % ash, volume, and bone breaking strength (BBS) from week 6-16 and from weeks 51-61, respectively. From week 0-17, FC was higher (P&#226;&#164;0.01) when feeding RC+ (5.11 kg) than RC (4.81 kg) otherwise there was no effect on Gain (1,017 and 1,029 g, respectively, P=0.53) or FE (0.199 and 0.214, respectively, P=0.08). Strain had no effect on FC, Gain, or FE. Mortality increased (P&#226;&#164;0.03) by period in the B compared to H strain. Layer performance was not affected by feeding the increased calcium during rearing or lay. Strain effected (P&#226;&#164;0.05) feed consumption, feed efficiency, egg production, and mortality. Feeding more Ca during rearing increased DFEW (RC+=0.94 g vs. RC=0.82 g, P=0.04) while strain effected bone volume (H=2.99 and B=2.37 cc, P&#226;&#164;0.01) and femoral BBS (B=8.55 vs. H=7.80 kg, P=0.01) of pullets. Feeding more Ca during lay did not effect bone status, but feeding it during rearing increased BBS (RC+=14.15 vs. RC=12.37 kg, P&#226;&#164;0.01) in older layers. Strain effected (P&#226;&#164;0.001) both BBS (H=14.26 vs. B=12.26 kg) and volume (H=5.90 vs. B=6.27 cc). These findings indicate that feeding increased Ca during rearing and laying impacts bone mineralization and may be a useful strategy to mitigate bone weakness and such related conditions as cage layer osteoporosis.</field><field name="date">2009-05-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03272009-155748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Absent Voices: Searching for Women and African Americans at Historic Stagville and Somerset Place Historic Sites</field><field name="creator">Taft, Kimberly E.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the interpretation at Somerset Place and Historic Stagville, two North Carolina Historic Sites.

Sustainable forest management is one part of the overall picture of sustainable development. One method to assess sustainable forest management is through the use of criteria and indicators. Criteria represent sustainable management goals. Indicators are measurable quantities that designate whether the goals are being met. The maintenance of forest health and vitality is a criterion of the Montr&#233;al Process Criteria and Indicators for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate and Boreal Forests. Measures of air pollution, forest disturbance, and change in ecological integrity provide indicators of how well forest health and vitality are being maintained. Using national databases, I assess air pollution in the United States, demonstrate the use of epidemiological approaches to examine forest disturbances, and develop an analytical technique to identify gaps and target priorities in reserve networks. The analyses in this dissertation offer new approaches to large-scale analysis of Montr&#233;al Process Criteria and Indicators. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) From 1994 through 2000 air pollution was highest in the northeastern United States and the oak-hickory and loblolly-shortleaf forest type groups were consistently exposed to more air pollution than other forest types. Conversely, the western white pine and larch forest type groups were consistently exposed to less air pollution than all other forest types. (2) Examination of the southeastern United States revealed high rates of forest fragmentation in the piedmont and coastal plain region. In the Pacific North west, insect and pathogen activity was analyzed and recurring clusters of high rates of activity were identified. (3) Although protected areas of the Douglas-fir forest type group occurred throughout much of the species range, most existed in colder and drier parts of the range. To conserve representative habitats, future conservation efforts would be most effective in warmer and wetter areas of western Oregon, northwestern Washington, and northwestern California.</field><field name="date">2004-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282004-103433/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Labeling Strategies for Improving the Efficiency of Structure Determination by NMR</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Constance Ann</field><field name="description">Rapid and efficient methods for preparing isotopically labeled recombinant proteins and refining solved structures via NMR are presented. The former approach was developed for 2H/13C/15N isotopic labeling and specific protonation of the methyl groups of isoleucine, leucine, and valine (ILV) residues of rat brain calbindin D28K, a calcium sensor and buffer. This protocol produces cell mass using unlabeled rich media followed by exchange into labeled media at high cell density. Allowing for a short period for growth recovery and unlabeled metabolite clearance, the cells were induced. Additionally, the solution structure of LuxU, a subunit of the quorum sensing circuit of Vibrio harveyi, has been refined using residual dipolar coupling (RDC). In slightly anisotropic environments, large one-bond internuclear dipolar interactions no longer average to zero, and therefore can provide information on the average orientation of the corresponding vectors relative to the magnetic field. This ordering was induced by introducing Pf1 filamentous bacteriophage into a solution of 13C15N isotopically labeled LuxU.</field><field name="date">2004-04-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282004-195953/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of sorghum sudangrass as a summer cover crop and marketable hay crop for organic, no-till production of fall cabbage</field><field name="creator">Finney, Denise McKinney</field><field name="description">The development of organic and conservation tillage-based vegetable production systems will offer growers in the southeastern United States new economic opportunities and promote resource conservation. The purpose of this research project was to assess the impact of incorporating a summer crop that serves as both cover crop and marketable hay crop in an organic fall vegetable production system. Sorghum sudangrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench X S. sudanense (Piper) Staph] is commonly cultivated as a forage crop in the Southeast and has the potential to produce abundant biomass, suppress weeds, and decrease soil compaction as a summer cover crop. Field studies were conducted to determine the effects of sorghum sudangrass cutting frequency and biomass removal as hay on cover crop biomass production, weed suppression by cover crop residues, and cover crop re-growth in a subsequent cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) crop under conventional and no-till management. Field and greenhouse studies were undertaken to identify potential negative interactions between cover crop residues and cabbage transplants. Transplant dry weight and head weight of the indicator species, cabbage, were used to assess the impact of cover crop management and tillage system on crop growth and development. Results suggest that a sorghum sudangrass hay crop can be harvested without compromising weed suppressive qualities of the cover crop. In this study, however, the presence of sorghum sudangrass led to reductions in cabbage transplant growth and head weight. Sorghum sudangrass may not be suitable as a cover crop immediately prior to conventional or no-till fall vegetable production due to its propensity to re-grow and allelopathic potential.</field><field name="date">2005-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282005-141749/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Evolution of Criticism on Jean-Fran&#231;ois Millet</field><field name="creator">Amley, Hollis Marie</field><field name="description">AMLEY, HOLLIS MARIE. The Evolution of Criticism on Jean-Fran&#231;ois Millet. (Under the direction of Keith Luria.) The nineteenth-century French painter Jean-Fran&#231;ois Millet?s social context, compositional style, and rustic subject matter invite a wide variety of interpretations of his art. To his biographer and contemporary Alfred Sensier, the rustic canvases were the work of a stoic ?peasant painter,? removed from the political controversies of his day. To the Marxist art historian T. J. Clark, on the other hand, Millet?s paintings interacted with and challenged the dominant values and institutions of the Second Republic. To the social art historian Robert Herbert, the paintings reveal the artist?s response to urban-industrial change and his Parisian exodus. In presenting these three formative readings of Millet?s canvases, this thesis demonstrates how each particular writer?s vantage point in history affected both his methodology and vision of the artist?s identity. The criticism on Millet shows not merely a series of antithetical, isolated opinions, but a kind of evolution, one that has gradually come to include both the artist and the society in which he worked.</field><field name="date">2005-03-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282005-154529/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, Control, and the Gender Gap in Delinquency: Reconsidering the Gendered Translation of Power from Workplace to Household</field><field name="creator">Cornell, Rena</field><field name="description">Power-control theory provides one of most comprehensive theoretical explorations of the gender gap in delinquency to date. The theory posits that the relative power of husbands and wives in the workplace translates directly into their relative power within the home. Household power relations, in turn, are played out in the relative control of sons and daughters, influencing ultimately the gender gap in delinquency through social psychological processes of familial control and socialization toward risk. This paper reformulates power-control theory in two important ways. First, it borrows from the family and gender literature on status-reversal and single mother households to critique the simplistic discussion of the translation of gendered power relations from workplaces to households. In doing so, the paper specifies an alternative discussion of power relations and family structures. Second, the paper draws upon criminological research and theorizing on gender and delinquency to posit a more thorough discussion of the social psychological mechanisms linking gendered power differentials to the gender gap in delinquency. Thus, the paper presents a reformulation of power-control theory that reconsiders both structural-level power differentials between mothers and fathers and individual-level processes of control and socialization of sons and daughters. From this reformulation, I derive and test hypotheses using a nationally representative sample of youths. The results suggest that further consideration of how power translates from workplaces to households is necessary and also provide some support for recent theorizing about gender differences in the social psychological mechanisms leading to the gender gap in delinquency.</field><field name="date">2005-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282005-180403/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical and Experimental Investigation of the Damping Matrix in Shear Building Models</field><field name="creator">Cropper, Michael Evan</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we present a study conducted on investigating the nature of damping matrix associated with multi degree of freedom simple shear building models. The various conventional methods of creating damping matrices in structures are summarized and numerical examples are used to illustrate the inconsistencies among them. Numerical examples are also used to illustrate the significance of non-zero off diagonal terms in the transformed damping matrix obtained after pre and post multiplication with mode shape matrix, i.e. the significance of non-classical nature of damping matrix in certain cases. The analytical study is followed by the description of a laboratory experiment that is developed to evaluate the validity of analytical results. The results from experimental studies of simple 2-DOF and 3-DOF shear building models, both with and without supplemental damping devices, are presented to validate the inconsistencies associated with the conventional methods of creating damping matrices in structures. It is also shown that the incorrect formulation of damping matrix results in highly incorrect responses. Several formulations for damping matrices are then proposed and their validity is evaluated by comparison with experimental results.</field><field name="date">2006-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282006-113719/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determination of Impedance Boundary Conditions for the Pulmonary Vasculature</field><field name="creator">Clipp, Rachel Betany</field><field name="description">Computational modeling can be used to achieve a better understanding of fluid analysis within the pulmonary circulation. Boundary conditions are used in fluid analysis to determine the pressure and flow profiles of the blood as it moves through the lung. Accurate boundary conditions are critical in providing accurate models of blood pressure and blood flow. An important consideration when determining boundary conditions for the pulmonary vasculature is the effect of respiration on the impedance of the pulmonary vasculature. An additional consideration for the pulmonary vasculature is the physiologic differences between the pulmonary circulation and that of the systemic circulation. This research determines impedance boundary conditions for the pulmonary vasculature that reflect the specific geometry of the lung and correspond to maximal inspiration and maximal expiration. The analysis was performed using an existing one-dimensional finite element analysis system. The boundary conditions were defined by a bifurcating structure tree with a number of variables that were used to change the resistance of the pulmonary vessels. The variables within the structure tree were altered to reflect the differences between the pulmonary circulation and the systemic circulation. These variables include the length to radius ratio of the vessels in the structure tree and the asymmetry as the branches. A respiration factor was used to scale the vessels of the structure tree to reflect the effects of respiration on the geometry of the lung. The compliance of the vessels was also changed to reflect the more distensible vessels found in the pulmonary system. The geometry of the lung was defined with the structured tree parameters at maximal inspiration and the respiration factor was used to scale the defined geometry and reflect maximal expiration. The parameters were determined by utilizing an optimization technique. The Levinberg-Marquardt least-squares non-linear optimization algorithm was used to find a set of non-unique optimal parameters. The computed data was validated using measured pressure and flow data collected in a previous study.</field><field name="date">2007-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282007-001101/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body Politics in Don DeLillo, Adrienne Rich, and Andy Warhol: A Study in Postmodern American Culture</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Jennifer Camille</field><field name="description">For many postmodern artists, such as Don DeLillo, Adrienne Rich, and Andy Warhol, the human body and identity are constantly challenged, refigured, and re-envisioned.

In Chapter Three, ?The Visual Art of Andy Warhol: Fame, Death, and Disaster in American Popular Culture,? I investigate how Warhol explores the human body as image and surface that lack depth or inherent meaning and human identity as a fa&#231;ade manufactured by American culture. In the ?Concluding Remarks,?

We comput the spectrum of scalar mesons by diagonalizing a relativized, QCD-inspired model Hamiltonian written in a basis of 25 simple harmonic oscillator states. The masses are then used to perform a mixing analysis which assumes that the heavy isoscalars are mixtures of quarkonia and the scalar glueball. The resulting quark-glue content is used along with the meson wave functions determined from the spectrum to compute the decay rates to pairs of pseudoscalar mesons (two pions, two kaons, two eta mesons). We find that when the glueball contributions to the decays are ignored, the results are in poor agreement with the available data. However, when we estimate the effect of including the glueball contributions in the decays, a solution can be found that matches the data quite well. In this solution, the f0(1710) is mostly glueball (78%) while the f0(1500) and f0(1370) are mostly mixtures of quarkonia. Additionally, in this solution the glueball contributions to kaon and eta final states are significant, while the contributions to the pion final state is negligible. This finding is in agreement with Chanowitz who uses chiral perturbation theory to show that the amplitude for a scalar glueball to decay to a quark-antiquark pair is proportional to the quark mass. This results in a suppression of the pion decay channel compared to the kaon and eta decay channels.</field><field name="date">2008-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282008-142316/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#226;Stubborn Back-looking Ghosts&#226;: Mourning as a Control Mechanism in William Faulkner&#226;s Absalom, Absalom! and The Unvanquished</field><field name="creator">Page, Summerlin Leigh</field><field name="description">In these two novels that involve the Civil War, Faulkner presents varying responses to loss. Rosa Coldfield of Absalom, Absalom! and The Unvanquished&#226;s Drusilla Hawk are women out of place in their society, without clearly defined roles. Both women attempt to gain control despite their lack of autonomy and refuse to accept their losses. Rosa Coldfield falls into a perpetual state of mourning, and Drusilla Hawk undertakes a series of actions in order to ignore her losses. Rosa&#226;s grief consumes and infuriates her, and Drusilla&#226;s coping mechanisms fail to help her come to terms with her fianc&#195;&#169;&#226;s death and her difficulties as a Southern woman who cannot live up to societal expectations. Drusilla&#226;s failure to cope effectively with her losses is emphasized by her cousin Bayard&#226;s ability to recover from the deaths of the two most important people in his life and create an existence without them. Bayard&#226;s responses to loss exhibit how opportunities for mourning work and availability of new roles can help the grieving process be successful. Further, the women&#226;s use of mourning as a method of attempting to gain control over their lives and surroundings is especially significant in light of the memorial movement after the Civil War. In the post-bellum South, women were proponents of memorialization and commemoration; these activities were also used to keep the &#226;Lost Cause&#226; alive. Through Rosa Coldfield and Drusilla Hawk, Faulkner expresses how grief can cripple those who cannot move on to new roles or find new purposes in life after a significant loss.</field><field name="date">2008-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03282008-150441/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Characterization of the Ichthyobodo necator Complex: An Important Fish Ectoparasite</field><field name="creator">Callahan, Heather Ann</field><field name="description">Ichthyobodo necator is a member of the Order Kinetoplastida and an important fish ectoparasite with a broad host and ecological range. When Ichthyobodo were exposed to the anesthetic tricaine, buffered with sodium bicarbonate, parasites remained attached to the skin of fish. When parasites were exposed to unbuffered tricaine, they detached almost completely from the skin. This finding indicated that tricaine should always be buffered when fish are to be clinically evaluated to prevent a reduction or complete loss in parasite load. Unbuffered tricaine was used to collect large numbers of parasites from the skin and gills of hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis male x M. chrysops female) for DNA isolation and analysis. A method for obtaining samples for DNA isolation without use of tricaine was also determined. Four preservation methods (Utermohl?s solution, ethanol, formalin, freezing) and two DNA isolation methods (DNA isolation kit, crude lysate) were examined. It was concluded that ethanol-fixation was the best preservation method for DNA isolation and PCR amplification of Ichthyobodo DNA. Using these methods, genomic DNA was isolated from Ichthyobodo trophonts collected from five freshwater and one marine fish. The 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from each isolate was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced. The 18S rRNA gene suggested that rather than being a single species, Ichthyobodo represented a complex of at least four different species, each of which occupied a distinct geographical region. The 18S rRNA gene was also amplified and cloned for related kinetoplastid speceis. Phylogenetic relationships within the Order Kinetoplastida (suborders Bodonina and Trypanosomatina) were determined. The suborder Bodonina appeared to contain at least 3 major lineages, none of which correlated with currently recognized families. Ichthyobodo had the most divergent sequence within the Bodonina, indicating it was the most genetically distinct bodonid currently known. The study of Ichthyobodo has contributed to a new understanding of phylogenetics and systematics for the Order Kinetoplastida, as well as insight into the potential for the spread of this parasite locally, nationally and internationally.</field><field name="date">2003-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292003-152735/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Study of the Tacit Knowledge Management Potential of Pair Programming</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Dylan Garrett</field><field name="description">This work describes an experiment comparing knowledge sharing in two distinct team structures. Given the increasing importance of knowledge in the workplace, especially software engineering, we are interested in paradigms that can assist in knowledge management. To this end, we conducted an experiment to determine how the paired or solo programming model affects knowledge sharing during a software project. We show a pattern of results that suggest pair programming has a positive effect on knowledge sharing. We also find development time is somewhat higher when using paired programming, but product quality is unaffected by programming method though these results are not statistically significant.</field><field name="date">2004-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292004-213121/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship between Symmetric Brace Algebras and Pre-Lie Algebras</field><field name="creator">Hillman, Rebecca Ann</field><field name="description">In this paper, we review the definitions of brace algebras, symmetric brace algebras, and pre-Lie algebras. We also look at a few examples of the calculations used in the brace algebra relations. We discuss the results of other mathematicians in these fields and where the topic of symmetric brace algebras is used. We then show a direct proof that a symmetric brace algebra is isomorphic to a pre-Lie algebra, using only the definitions. Showing that a symmetric brace algebra yields a pre-Lie algebra is very straightforward. However, the converse, a pre-Lie algebra yields a symmetric brace algebra, is not obvious. This paper uses an inductive proof to show the symmetry holds and that the brace is well-defined. Combinatorics plays a large factor in showing the brace is well-defined, along with identifying and classifying terms in a relation with m+n variables.</field><field name="date">2005-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292005-215238/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reaching Non-industrial Private Forestland Owners with Their Preferred Methods of Information Delivery</field><field name="creator">Miller, Kevin Todd</field><field name="description">In North Carolina, non-industrial private forestland owners control approximately 78% of the state?s forested resource (18.8 million acres). Because they provide benefits that contribute to the health and economic well-being of the state, it is critically important that this diverse group of people is supplied with research-based forestry information and education to ensure the sustainable management of North Carolina?s natural resources. Researchers have evaluated the efficacy of non-traditional methods of information exchange and have determined overall preferences for information delivery methods, but have been unable thus far to satisfactorily connect particular information delivery preferences with other characteristics of landowners. The objective of this study was to seek out and describe groups within the population of non-industrial private forestland owners with particular information delivery method preferences. Identification of these groups will allow educational efforts to be more directed, making outreach efforts more efficient and cost-effective. A questionnaire was mailed to a stratified random sample of 2600 non-industrial private forestland owners from both urban and rural counties found within each of North Carolina?s seven Cooperative Extension districts. A cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct clientele groups among landowners based on their preferences for delivery methods. These groups were used to correlate preference for information delivery methods with more easily identifiable socio-demographic, land, or management characteristics of individuals. Based on the results, recommendations are made to assist Extension Forestry at North Carolina State University increase its impact on the citizens of the state.</field><field name="date">2006-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292006-073825/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision-Theoretic Narrative Planning for Guided Exploratory Learning Environments</field><field name="creator">Mott, Bradford Wayne</field><field name="description">Interactive narrative environments have been the focus of increasing attention in recent years. A key challenge posed by these environments is narrative planning, in which a director agent orchestrates all of the events in an interactive virtual world. To create effective interactions, the director agent must cope with the task's inherent uncertainty, including uncertainty about the user's intentions. Moreover, director agents must be efficient so they can operate in real time. To address these issues, we present U-DIRECTOR, a decision-theoretic narrative planning architecture that dynamically models narrative objectives (e.g., plot progress, narrative flow), storyworld state (e.g., physical state, plot focus), and user state (e.g., goals, beliefs) with a dynamic decision network (DDN) that continually selects storyworld actions to maximize narrative utility on an ongoing basis. DDNs extend decision networks by introducing the ability to model attributes whose values change over time; decision networks extend Bayesian networks by supporting utility-based rational decision making. The U-DIRECTOR architecture also employs an n-gram goal recognition model that exploits knowledge of narrative structure to recognize users' goals and an HTN planner that operates in two coordinated planning spaces to integrate narrative and tutorial planning. U-DIRECTOR has been implemented in a narrative planner for an interactive narrative learning environment in the domain of microbiology in which a user plays the role of a medical detective solving a science mystery. Formal evaluations suggest that the U-DIRECTOR architecture satisfies the real-time constraints of interactive narrative environments and creates engaging experiences.</field><field name="date">2006-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292006-110906/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE IMPACT OF SIZE AND LOCATION ON COLLEGIATE SPORTS SPONSORSHIP</field><field name="creator">Wojdylo, Jesse Ross</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of location and size on sponsorships in collegiate athletics.

Small universities, under 15,000 students, were found to have a greater number of sponsors than large universities with 15,000 or more students. The size of the football program had no relationship on the total number of sponsors for an athletic department. Several industries were regionalized in terms of high sponsorship rate. The sponsors that were the most regionalized were the telecommunications industry in the Southeast, the medical industry in the Northwest and the automotive industry in the Midwest.

Applications for electron beam chemistry include repair and fabrication of lithographic masks, integrated circuit repair and rewiring, nanofabrication of functional nanoscale tools and scanned probe microscopy tips and damage free transmission electron microscope sample preparation. The use of hydrocarbon contamination as a precursor has been investigated and complex three dimensional nanostructures have been successfully fabricated. Accelerating voltage and scan speed can be used to control the morphology of the deposits. The development and implementation of an internal precursor reservoir and introduction device that is transferable to various scanning electron microscope and focused ion beam instruments has been performed. The effects of beam and scan parameters on the deposition efficiency of carbon structures utilizing a phenanthrene precursor has been investigated. Deposition efficiency is maximized for low beam current, large scan areas exposed for short times using the experimental conditions in this work. However, the use of a focused ion beam provides a significantly higher deposition efficiency (over 45 times) than that of an electron beam.</field><field name="date">2007-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292007-064656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Repeatabilities and Heritabilities of Behavior Traits and Their Relationship With Performance</field><field name="creator">Velie, Brandon D</field><field name="description">The object of this study was to estimate repeatabilities and heritabilities of indirect measures of pig behavior. Relationships of measures of behavior with production traits were estimated. Traits chosen were backtest, resident-intruder, human approach (HAT), novel object (NOT), birth weight (BW), backfat depth (BF), loin muscle area (LMA), average daily gain in the farrowing house (ADGFH), average daily gain (ADG), 21 d weight (21DW), and 140 d weight (W). Each behavior trait was measured twice (n &#8805; 457). The study consisted of 95 litters from 31 sires with an average of 3 sires per litter. Between 7 and 14 d of age the backtest was conducted by placing each pig in the supine position for 60 s. Total time spent struggling (TTS) and total number of attempts to struggle (TAS) were recorded. The resident-intruder test was performed in the nursery while the human approach (HAT) and novel object tests (NOT) were performed on the finishing floor. The resident intruder test involved two pigs; a resident pig and an intruder pig from another litter. The resident pen was divided in half with a solid door. One pig, a resident, was placed in the test area and an intruder pig was then introduced. Time taken until an attack occurred (LAT) and total number of attacks over the two tests (RIS) were recorded. Amount of time taken for each pig to make snout contact with an unfamiliar human (HAT) or object (NOT) was recorded. Dam and sire effects were significant for all traits (p &lt; 0.01). Sex and pen effects were significant for LAT, RIS, HAT, and NOT (p &lt; 0.10). Repeatabilities of TTS, TAS, RIS, LAT, HAT, and NOT were 0.38, 0.21, 0.07, 0.08, 0.17, 0.11, respectively. The phenotypic correlation between TTS and TAS was 0.61 and the phenotypic correlation between HAT and NOT was 0.34. The phenotypic relationship between RIS and LAT was -0.85. Total time spent struggling and TAS tended to be phenotypically correlated with 21DW and ADGFH. TAS was phenotypically correlated with BF (0.15). Latency until an attack occurred was phenotypically correlated with LMA (0.23). RIS was phenotypically correlated with ADG (-0.13), W (-0.13), and LMA (-0.21). Heritabilities of TTS and TAS were 0.31 and 0.53, respectively. Genetic correlation of TAS with both ADG and W was 0.38. Genetic correlations of TTS with BF, W, and TAS were 0.14, 0.18, and 0.81, respectively. It was concluded that the backtest is a heritable and repeatable measure of a behavioral characteristic in pigs that is both phenotypically and genetically correlated with performance.</field><field name="date">2007-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03292007-223828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite Element Simulations of Shape Memory Alloy Actuators in Adaptive Structures</field><field name="creator">Frautschi, Jason Paul</field><field name="description">Shape memory alloys possess an inherent actuation capability that makes them attractive as actuators in adaptive structures, especially in applications in which their large strains, high specific work output and potential for structural integration are beneficial. However, the requisite extensive physical testing has slowed development of potential applications and highlighted the need for a simulation tool for feasibility studies. In this study, such a tool has been developed by implementing the M&#252;ller-Achenbach-Seelecke shape memory alloy model into a commercial finite element code. The material model is described with particular emphasis on its ability to predict actuatoric performance and suitability for use in the context of a displacement-based finite element framework. The interaction between the material model and the solution algorithm for the global finite element equations is thoroughly investigated with respect to the effect of solution parameters on convergence, computational cost and accuracy. Finally, simulations of several flexible structures actuated by shape memory alloys are presented as examples of the potential of the implementation to analyze practical applications. The implementation represents a versatile and novel tool for the simulation of adaptive structural components using shape memory alloy actuators.</field><field name="date">2003-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302003-174528/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Dynamics of Heliothis virescens (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in a Host-Species Rich Agroecosystem: Implications for Insecticide Resistance Management</field><field name="creator">Abney, Mark Ray</field><field name="description">A three-year evaluation of crop host utilization by the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), was conducted from 2001 to 2003 in the central coastal plain of North Carolina. Monitoring of commercial tobacco and non-Bt cotton fields revealed spatial and temporal patterns of host use, and showed that tobacco budworm may be produced in tobacco throughout the growing season. Small plot trials conducted in 2002 and 2003 demonstrated a strong oviposition preference by tobacco budworm for tobacco when located adjacent to alternate crop hosts. The bodies of individual moths were analyzed for the presence of a cotton-specific analyte, gossypol, using high-pressure liquid chromatography?mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HPLC-MSMS). This technique provides a conservative estimate of tobacco budworm production on hosts other than cotton. Analysis of feral moths revealed that &lt;10% of tobacco budworms collected in North Carolina contained gossypol. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis of 13C/12C ratios of moths reared on four crop-plant species and two common weed species revealed a range of d13C values within that expected for plants utilizing the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Feral tobacco budworm moths collected over three years were found to have carbon isotope ratios consistent with those having fed on C3 plants. No unique carbon isotope signature was discovered that would enable a reliable determination of natal origin of feral tobacco budworm with current IRMS technology. Dose-mortality studies were conducted in 2004 to determine the susceptibility of two North Carolina strains of tobacco budworm to cypermethrin. LD50 values were 4 and 9 times greater for tobacco budworms collected in June and August respectively than for a susceptible laboratory strain. Foliar applications of pyrethroid insecticides were made to flue-cured tobacco for control of the tobacco budworm in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Pyrethroids provided significant control of tobacco budworm when compared to untreated checks in all three years of the study; however, they were generally less efficacious than the standard insecticides tested.</field><field name="date">2005-03-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302005-113849/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the Effects of Metacognitive Instruction in Learning Primary School Science in Some Schools in Ethiopia</field><field name="creator">Sbhatu, Desta Berhe</field><field name="description">Metacognition is increasingly recognized as an important component in successful learning. In science, metacognitive instructional interventions have been successfully incorporated to promote conceptual change learning, facilitate negotiating and constructing of meanings, and foster reading and problem solving abilities of learners. The present study investigated the contribution of three metacognitive instructional methods, namely graphic organizers, metacognitive reflection, and metacognitive reading in learning science among primary school students age 10-14 years) in Mekelle, Ethiopia. The metacognitive instructional methods were believed to be efficient to introduce and transform learner-centeredness in science instruction under Ethiopia's primary school settings by allowing students to think productively and regulate their own learning. Qualitative study indicated that the metacognitive instructional methods fostered student conceptual understanding of science topics and enhanced active student participation. Quantitative study of post-scores of Immediate test-groups revealed that graphic organizers had some contribution in helping students perform better in 'application' type tests. Metacognitive reflection activities enabled students to perform better in 'application' and 'transfer' type tests as well as enhancing mean post-test scores. Metacognitive reading activities did not yield any apparent effects on post-intervention tests. The effects of the metacognitive methods were diminished among Delayed post-test groups.</field><field name="date">2006-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302006-142719/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fermat Curves on Weighted Projective Planes</field><field name="creator">Kermes, Jeremiah Mitchell Mr</field><field name="description">This paper takes the classical result that a homogeneous polynomial of degree d&#8805;2 defines a curve of genus</field><field name="date">2007-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302007-160623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological and cultural stress in a South Appalachian Mississippian settlement: Town Creek Indian Mound, Mt. Gilead, NC</field><field name="creator">Cunningham, Sarah L.</field><field name="description">Town Creek Indian Mound was an important ceremonial center of the Pee Dee culture for approximately 200 years (A.D. 1150 - 1400) before it was abandoned. Biological indicators, such as the prevalence of diseases like cribra orbitalia, and decreases in stature attainment from previous generations will be presented. Often site abandonment will also be preceded by increases in cultural stress, such as trauma, as the population reacts to worsening conditions. These three indicators are used to determine if the Pee Dee population living at Town Creek was, in fact, experiencing biological or cultural stress at the end of their habitation of the site. Comparisons were made between an early habitation phase (Teal/Early Town Creek period) and a late phase (Late Town Creek/Leak period). MANOVA statistical analysis found that, of the long bone length measurements, only the female humerus was found to be variable between time phases, with the bone becoming longer in the late phase. Neither cribra nor trauma increased significantly in the late phase. Drought reconstructions have shown that, while the area has experienced extended periods of mild drought and even one intense drought, these periods corresponded with increased site activity, including the construction of monumental architecture. All skeletal indicators and contextual climate reconstructions point to a stable environment and associated population. Issues with nutrition or violence within the culture did not precede the Pee Dee's abandonment of Town Creek, so the cause must lie with other unknown factors.</field><field name="date">2010-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302010-092340/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mothers, Workers and Students: Examining the experiences of single mothers transferring from community colleges into universities.</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Emily Erin</field><field name="description">Single parent households are on the rise, and female headed households are more likely to live in poverty than other single parent households (Holyfield, 2002). Many single mothers who do not have an undergraduate degree see education as a way out of poverty (Holyfield, 2002; Heller &amp; Bjorklund, 2004). This research was undertaken to highlight areas where universities are assisting single mothers to attain a degree. This qualitative study utilized semi-structured in depth interviews of 16 single mothers who transferred from community college to a university. Three themes emerged regarding the educational experiences of single mothers who work and attend college. The first theme, &#226;Finding my way to and through college&#226;; highlights their motivating factors, their support network(s) and their feelings of pride. The second theme, &#226;Struggle for legitimacy as a parenting student&#226; focuses on the challenges that confront mothers as students: invisibility within the institution, and the fact that motherhood is a full time job which she cannot neglect. The final theme, &#226;Striving for balance between multiple roles&#226; centers around how they cope with their multiple obligations: knowing herself (honoring abilities as well as limits), and overcoming time scarcity (by managing multiple priorities). Women in this study were challenged by financial need not met by aid packages, finding appropriate child care, insensitive instructors and class schedules which made working difficult. These women were proud of their academic accomplishments and felt supported by institutional recognition of success. They were also supported by student health, counseling services and academic support programs.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302010-132936/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Joint Retirement Decisions between Husbands and Wives</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jinjing</field><field name="description">This thesis uses data obtained from the Rand Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to examine whether husbands and wives will decide to retire jointly or separately.

Mutual consent divorce law was promulgated in the 1970&#226;s. Although this amendment was a reflection of the social change occurring in the United States of America, unilateral divorce was still feared because some expected it to increase divorce rate. Friedberg and Wolfers made big contributions in this field of study. Friedberg believed that divorce rates have increased as a result of the law change while Wolfers agrees that an initial spike is clear but argues that the effect of the new legislations dissipates with time. I adjust the data they use to take into account separation requirements which they have not considered or merely thought of as an extra cost. Some states did require individuals to separate for a certain amount of time before granting them divorce. I use the same regressions as Friedberg and Wolfers for the same period of time but with a different dependant variable: divorce initiation rate. My results then differ when aligning divorces with the period when they got initiated. I conclude that Friedberg overestimated the effect but that the effect did persist and did not disappear like Wolfers claimed.</field><field name="date">2010-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302010-161314/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable Service Rate Analysis at Signalized Intersections with Short Left Turn Pockets Using Macroscopic Simulation</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, William Leonard</field><field name="description">A macroscopic simulation tool is developed and tested in order to quantify the effects of short turn pockets on the sustainable service rate of a signalized intersection. Unlike the theoretical signal capacity, the sustainable service rate includes queue interaction effects and is thus influenced by blockage and spillback at the entrance to a short turn pocket. Previous research on the topic has focused either on the probability of spillback from a short turn pocket or the operation of a system with a single approach lane. No macroscopic model currently available has the ability to analyze throughput reductions due to short turn pocket effects on a multilane approach. The model described herein utilizes a series of flow and density restrictions on cells of varying sizes on the approach to the intersection. Results indicate sensitivity of the model to turn pocket spillback, blockage, saturation flow rate, pocket length, lane utilization, phase sequence, phase overlap, permitted phasing, and time-dependent demand. A phase optimization procedure is also described to help efficiently allocate green time for a given set of turn pocket lengths and turn movement percentages. Outputs from the model compare favorably to results generated using microsimulation software, and recommendations are made regarding additional model enhancements and testing needs.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302010-171706/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemostatic Mechanisms of Common Textile Wound Dressing Materials</field><field name="creator">Rush, Tabitha</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to develop a series of material treatments and modifications, and, using a standardized set of tests, determine the extent of the ability of the modified material to enhance coagulation. This research focuses on materials commonly used in traditional textile based wound dressings; utilizing Streaming Potential studies, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Thrombin Assays. The materials tested can be classified into 4 groups: control materials, modified PLA, SAMs treated glass, and TEOS treated materials. The control materials included: spun cotton and rayon yarn; continuous filament Nylon, Polypropylene (PP), and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET); heat cleaned glass (control glass); and PLA staple fibers. Contact angle measurements showed that both the control glass and the PET showed an increase in contact angle when treated with TEOS. This corresponds to a decrease and no improvement, respectively, in thrombogenicity for these materials in the thrombin assay. The remaining materials tested showed no change or a decrease in contact angle after TEOS treatment, and a corresponding increase in thrombogenicity. These results support previous studies that indicate an increase in wettability contributes to the enhancement of coagulation (16). While the streaming potential studies showed no correlation between thrombin formation or contact angle data, these tests provided an important launching platform for future studies utilizing the Streaming Potential Jar. Future work could benefit from the use of more physiologically relevant solutions, such as CaCl2, NaCl, or other blood substitutes (15). While no definitive correlations between test methods were elucidated, the results garnered from this research created a strong launching platform from which future materials research can continue.</field><field name="date">2010-05-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03302010-230342/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compression and Transmission of Facial Images Over Very Narrowband Channels</field><field name="creator">Gunduz, Aysegul</field><field name="description">Law enforcement officers on mobile duty are often confronted with ID authentication of subjects, requiring the transmission of a driver?s license picture over wireless channels with very narrow bandwidths.

Utilizing media elements in an application that requires them to be temporally coordinated in real-time presents synchronization issues because the wrong timing or duration of media elements will be easily detected by the user. Most media-rich systems have solved various aspects of the media element synchronization problem. However, they have done so in an ad hoc manner without providing a generic reusable framework. This thesis proposes a framework for real-time synchronization in intelligent media generators. Our research addresses six primary issues that are essential to creating media-rich systems that do not utilize an ad hoc solution to their media element synchronization problems: synchronization of media elements, decoupling high-level and low-level processing, extensibility, media element sequencing, real-time performance, and domain-independence. The framework has been implemented in an agent-based multimedia generator for an intelligent tutoring system to demonstrate its feasibility.</field><field name="date">2004-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312004-191928/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Kinase A Regulates &#946;2 Integrin Avidity Activation and Subsequent Neutrophil Activation via Modulation of Myosin Light Chain Kinase.</field><field name="creator">Chilcoat, Clayton Douglas</field><field name="description">&#946;2 integrins are adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils. Avidity activation of &#946;2 integrins includes transportation of pre-formed integrins to the cell surface and a conformational change in the integrin to a high-binding state. Upon binding ligand, &#946;2 integrins initiate a signaling cascade that results in activation of the neutrophil to a pro-inflammatory state, and the inhibition of this signal can prevent further activation of the neutrophil. cAMP and it effector protein kinase A (PKA) exert a generally inhibitory effect upon neutrophil activation. PKA has been shown to inactivate myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation is crucial for actin-myosin complex formation, which is required for stability and contraction of the actin cytoskeleton in neutrophils as well as &#946;2 integrin-dependent adhesion. We hypothesize that the inhibitory effect of PKA upon neutrophils is due to inhibition of &#946;2 integrin avidity activation resulting in the subsequent inhibition of neutrophil activation. Furthermore we hypothesize that the effect of PKA upon &#946;2 integrin avidity activation is mediated through PKA?s effect upon MLCK. We demonstrate that inhibition of PKA induces &#946;2 integrin-dependent adhesion and that augmentation of cAMP prevented &#946;2 integrin-dependent adhesion and subsequent respiratory burst activity. Further, we demonstrate via flow cytometric detection of antibodies directed against &#946;2 integrins that pharmacologic inhibition of PKA activity results in overall increased &#946;2 integrin expression on the neutrophil surface, as well as increased expression of the activated form of the integrin. This upregulation and activation of &#946;2 integrins due to inhibition of PKA is abolished by pharmacologic MLCK inhibition. Inhibition of MLCK also blocked &#946;2 integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion achieved by inhibition of PKA, as well as neutrophil migration along towards a PKA inhibitor. These findings demonstrate that PKA regulation of &#946;2 integrin affinity activation and subsequent neutrophil activation is via an MLCK-dependent pathway.</field><field name="date">2005-04-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312005-093042/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape versus local determinants of butterfly movement behaviors.</field><field name="creator">Kuefler, Daniel Cory</field><field name="description">A thorough understanding of the mechanisms driving larger scale consequences of movement first requires an understanding of whether movement behaviors are related to local or landscape scale determinants. I studied the movement behaviors of four species of bottomland-dwelling butterflies in a natural setting to examine the determinants of movement behavior across different scales. Across spatial scales, I tested the relative importance and predictive value of three landscape attributes: topography, boundary contrast, and stream proximity, and two local habitat attributes: host plant cover and comprehensive vegetative structure. Across species, I tested the relative importance of organism size and habitat specificity to explain response variation. In general, butterfly responses to landscape features were stronger and more universal while responses to local features were weaker and more variable by species. Specifically, results from this study showed that topography does not influence movement behaviors but boundary contrast, stream proximity, and host plant abundance all contributed to movement patterns. Orientation to these features was not related to organism size, but did vary in accordance with habitat specificity. These results suggest that studies on dispersal in fragmented landscapes should consider the effects of that fragmentation on multiple scales. This consideration is particularly important in the management of rare species, when specific behaviors may ultimately affect the success of conservation efforts.</field><field name="date">2005-04-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312005-160616/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Observations on Upstream Flame Propagation in Ignited Hydrocarbon Jets</field><field name="creator">McCraw, Jennifer Leigh</field><field name="description">Studies are presented that examine the development of combustion in an initially non-reacting methane jet after ignition at a downstream location. Image measurements depicting the axial location of a fixed energy ignition source that permits transient flame propagation back to the nozzle are presented. The results from the experimental investigations are discussed. Nine different cases were investigated in order to determine the major parameters that impact the axial location of the ignition source at which flame propagation back to the burner was permitted. When the ignition source was located at larger axial distances than those indicated, flame propagation upstream to the burner was not possible and, instead, the flame blew out. The Reynolds number of the jet, the scalar field and the air co-flow magnitude were investigated for their contributions. A standard digital video camera was used in order to film the ignition of the jet and to determine the farthest axial location from the burner at which upstream flame propagation was possible. With the aid of computer software, the height for each case was determined. Conclusions to the effect these parameters had on the axial location are discussed as well as the implications for the physics governing the process.</field><field name="date">2006-05-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312006-002715/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active Body Bias for Low-Power Silicon-On-Insulator Design</field><field name="creator">Damiano, John</field><field name="description">SOI device technology offers the circuit designer higher performance and greater flexibility. This work proposes the use of a targeted substrate bias and innovative device and circuit topologies to achieve higher performance and lower power while providing a strategy to compensate for wide temperature and process variations. This project introduces and evaluates a modified H-gate device topology (integrated drain-body transistor, or IDBT) vs. alternative structures using simulation supported by electrical results obtained from test circuits. The IDBT can be used to locally and dynamically reduce MOSFET VTH, increase switching speed, and improve circuit energy-delay product by up to 30%. For all structures investigated, the dynamic body bias provided by IDBTs provides improved logic cell performance vs. conventional source-tied cell designs. This work also examines use of body bias to compensate for temperature or process variations. The temperature range seen by space electronics exceeds standard commercial specs and even military specs. Integrated circuits placed on a satellite or lander vehicle may be expected to operate from below -200&#186;C to over 200&#186;C. In this environment, the stabilization of key circuit parameters across temperature, whether power consumption or performance metrics, can be accomplished through a targeted substrate bias. The amount of stabilization available, i.e. the degree to which key parameters can be shifted in-situ, is explored. Similarly, variations in device parameters due to process variations can also be compensated using this technique. Finally, these efforts exposed marginalities in the models for Honeywell MOI5 MOSFETs. At low temperatures, the simulated device characteristics diverged substantially from the electrical data, while the PMOS device simulation results displayed incorrect body factor. This work interprets these results and develops improved models based on electrical results from a series of test structures.</field><field name="date">2006-04-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312006-003214/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Cross Regional Study of Locative to in North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Vadnais, Janelle Chaundre</field><field name="description">This study compares the use of static locative to in the speech of African Americans and European Americans in various regional communities throughout Eastern North Carolina. These communities are located on Roanoke Island, in Hyde County, Harkers Island, Ocracoke Island, Princeville and in Robeson County, North Carolina. Quantitative examination of locative to reveals a marked pattern of ethnolinguistic alignment related to integration patterns. In Hyde County and Roanoke Island, the use of locative to is sharply reduced in the speech of African Americans who first attended integrated schools. However, in Ocracoke, the decreasing use of locative to is gradual across time, marking the role of an active social variable in the divergence of African American speech after integration. By comparing all of these communities, I seek to explain why there is this ethnolinguistic patterning and what social factors have contributed to it. Additionally, I uncover what this language pattern says about the history of race relations on a regional level in North Carolina and what happens to this language feature over time.</field><field name="date">2006-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312006-113249/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' Pedagogy through Andragogy: Facilitating Learning in Secondary Education Students by Incorporating Self-Directed Learning</field><field name="creator">Masier, Darren J.</field><field name="description">In a qualitative analysis, based upon three cases of mid-career1 secondary education teachers, their strategies, philosophies, modalities, and student expectations were analyzed in an effort to understand the extent to which self-directed learning (SDL) can impact the success of students&#226; learning.

This progression in technology has been made possible by the parallel production of millions of short fragments of sequence. The responsibility of garnering biological information from these DNA fragments has shifted from the wet-lab to the bioinformatician. As sequencing technology is applied to a growing number of individual human genomes, entire families are now being sequenced. Information contained within the pedigree of a sequenced family can be leveraged when inferring the donors&#226; genotypes, a task that is not necessarily trivial using high-throughput sequencing reads. A violation of Mendelian inheritance laws observed amid the resequenced genomes of family members can indicate the presence of a de novo mutation. A method for locating de novo mutations by probabilistically inferring genotypes across a pedigree using high-throughput sequencing is presented and applied to two resequenced nuclear families: one as a collaborative effort within The 1,000 Genomes Project, and the second in an attempt to discover candidate driver and passenger mutations within the genome of an Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. The mutation findings within these projects are presented, and the approach is examined in detail, highlighting areas where method improvements may be made. Considering the challenges experienced in these studies within the larger context of the nascent field of Personal Genomics, an honest assessment is presented of developments that must be made before the application of whole-genome sequencing on the scale of an individual human can unequivocally be used to predict, diagnose, or treat human disease.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312010-151914/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Platinum and Platinum Alloy-Carbon Nanofiber Composites for Use as Electrodes in Direct Methanol Fuel Cells</field><field name="creator">Lin, Zhan</field><field name="description">In response to the energy needs of modern society and emerging ecological concerns, the pursuit of novel, low-cost, and environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage systems has raised significant interest. Among various energy conversion and storage systems, fuel cells have become a primary research focus since they convert chemical energy directly into electrical energy with high efficiency and low pollutant emissions. For example, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), which supply the electrical energy by converting methanol to energy, are an ideal fuel cell system for applications in electric vehicles and electronic portable devices due to their relatively quick start-up, rapid response to catalyst loading, and low operating temperature. However, the wide commercial use of DMFCs in advanced hybrid electric vehicles and electronic portable devices is hampered by their high cost, poor durability, and relatively low energy and power densities. In order to address these problems, their research focuses on the development of highly active electrode catalysts coupled with a suitable electrode structure for the oxidation of methanol at the anode and the reduction of oxygen at the cathode to attain high efficiency of DMFCs, and subsequently lowering the cost. In this dissertation, the fabrication of novel platinum and platinum alloy nanoparticle-loaded carbon nanofibers (CNFs) for use as electrodes in DMFCs is demonstrated through electrospinning, carbonization, and deposition. The resulting CNF-based electrodes possess the properties of high electroactive surface area, good catalytic abilities towards the oxidation of methanol and the reduction of oxygen, and great long-time stability. As a result, DMFCs using these CNFs-supported platinum and platinum alloy nanoparticles as electrodes offer many advantages, such as improved electrocatalytic abilities, long-term stability, easy fabrication, low cost, and environmental benignity. Therefore, this new technology opens up new opportunities to develop high-performance electrode materials in the future for high-performance DMFCs, which are one of the promising power sources for consumer devices and electric vehicles, and play a critical role in solving the worldwide critical energy issue.</field><field name="date">2010-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiber and Polymer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312010-171722/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of Ammonia and Long Chain Fatty Acids on Thermophilic Anaerobic Digestion of Swine Wastes</field><field name="creator">Creamer, Kurt Sereno</field><field name="description">Environmentally sound treatment of by-products in a value-adding process is an ongoing challenge in animal agriculture. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion of wastes originating from agricultural production and animal processing represents a potential waste treatment technology to address environmental concerns such as odor emissions and removal of pathogenic microorganisms, while at the same time producing renewable energy (biogas) as a by-product. However, thermophilic digestion is subject to inhibition by ammonia and long chain fatty acids (LCFA), both of which are prevalent in manure and animal processing wastewater. Several swine manure collection methods under development separate the urine from the feces, which creates the opportunity to operate a digester on feces only, greatly reducing the ammonia load to the digester. One objective of this study was to determine whether operation on feces only would yield significant performance improvements for a thermophilic anaerobic digester operating on swine waste. Effluent from a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was used as the inoculum for batch tests in which the substrate contained three different concentrations of urine (urine-free, as-excreted urine:feces ratio and double the as-excreted urine:feces ratio). Inocula were acclimated to these same urine:feces ratios to determine methane production. Results show that both urine-free and as-excreted substrates were not inhibitory to anaerobic inocula. Anaerobic microorganisms can be readily acclimated to substrate with double the as-excreted urine concentration, which contained TKN concentrations up to 7.20 g-N liter-1. The sludge collected from the dissolved air flotation (DAF) wastewater treatment process in swine processing facilities is an example of a high-lipid substrate containing potentially inhibitory levels of LCFA. A second objective of this study was to determine the fundamental performance parameters for thermophilic anaerobic digestion of DAF sludge. Testing in a semi-continuous stirred tank reactor and in batch reactors was conducted to determine substrate degradation rates and biogas yield. Stable operation could not be achieved using pure DAF sludge as a substrate, possibly due to inhibition by long chain fatty acids or to nutrient deficiencies. However, a 1:1 ratio (w/w, dry basis) of DAF sludge and swine manure (feces only), resulted in stable and productive digester operation. In the semi-continuous stirred reactor at 54.5&#239;&#176;C, a hydraulic residence time of 10 days, and an organic loading rate of 4.68 gVS/day/L, the methane production rate was 2.19 L/L/day and the specific methane production rate was 0.47 L/gVS (fed). Maximum specific methanogenic activity (SMA) in batch testing was 0.15 mmolesCH4 hr-1 gVS-1 at a manure/DAF substrate concentration of 6.9 gVS liter-1. Higher substrate concentrations cause an initial lag in methane production, possibly due to long chain fatty acid or nitrogen inhibition.</field><field name="date">2010-04-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-03312010-211111/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of a Child Maltreatment Prevention Self-help Program: The Role of Social Support and Parental Empowerment in Producing Positive Outcomes</field><field name="creator">Hart, Kendrea C.</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation study was to evaluate a child abuse prevention program for families considered at-risk for abuse. Specifically, this study sought to gain a better understanding of how program participation was associated with parenting behavior and child maltreatment risk, and if this relation was partially mediated by social support and parental empowerment. The sample consisted of 187 parents and grandparents who attended Circle of Parents groups throughout a southeastern state. It was hypothesized that (a) higher program participation would predict improvements in parenting behavior, lower levels of maltreatment risk, higher levels of social support within and outside the group, and higher feelings of parental empowerment; (b) higher levels of social support within and outside the group, as well as higher levels of parental empowerment, would predict improvements in parenting behavior and lower child maltreatment risk; (c) the relation between program participation and parenting behavior, as well as child maltreatment risk would be mediated by social support and parental empowerment. Results revealed that program participation significantly predicted improvements in parent behavior and social support within the group. In addition, social support within the group significantly predicted improvements in parent behavior. Social support outside the group also significantly predicted levels of lower child maltreatment risk. There was no support for mediation effects.

As MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) technology advances, sensors and actuators get smaller. MEMS sensors are very powerful and are highly accurate. These sensors are inexpensive and are readily available. Currently, in the textile machinery, drop wires are used to monitor the tension of the warp yarns in the weaving process. These drop wires are abrasive to the warp yarns and can lead to more warp yarn breaks. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a system that does not contact the warp yarn in any way, such that extra warp yarns are not broken because of the sensor. This research has led to the development of a sensor system that has no contact with the warp yarn. The main purpose was to show proof of concept for applying a MEMS sensor to the textile machinery, specifically the Jacquard Loom, in order to develop a sensor system having no contact with the warp yarns. A MEMS Accelerometer, available from Analog Devices, was used to monitor the motion of the heddle, whose acceleration properties change based on the presence of the warp yarn. Matlab was used to interpret the data and analyze for broken warp yarns (using recorded data) based on the change in acceleration. Once a warp yarn is determined to have been broken, Matlab would notify the user.</field><field name="date">2003-04-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012003-142151/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of Intra-Industry Trade in Intermediate Goods between the US and OECD Countries</field><field name="creator">Turkcan, Kemal</field><field name="description">The increased importance of fragmentation in world trade has created an interest among trade economists to explain the determinants of trade in intermediate goods. A substantial part of trade in intermediates between the US and OECD countries takes the form of intra-industry (IIT). I have divided total intra-industry trade into its horizontal and vertical components. Vertical IIT is defined as the exchange of intermediates which belong to the same industry but which are located at different stages on the production spectrum. Horizontal IIT is defined as the exchange of intermediate goods belonging to the same industry but differing in terms of characteristics or technological specifications, which are technologically unrelated. Hypotheses drawn from Ethier (1982) and Feenstra and Hanson (1997) are put forward to investigate the intra-industry trade in intermediates between the US and other selected OECD countries for the period of 1990-1996.To test these hypotheses, I have utilized three-way fixed effects and random effects models. The results confirm the hypothesis that the determinants of vertical and horizontal IIT in intermediates differ. Empirical results show that horizontal IIT is positively related to the size of markets and foreign direct investment, while it is negatively related to differences in human capital endowments and geographical proximity. On the other hand, vertical IIT is positively related to FDI, while it is negatively related to economies of scale.</field><field name="date">2003-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012003-144144/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Laboratory Report: A Pedagogical Tool in College Science Courses</field><field name="creator">Ferzli, Miriam</field><field name="description">When viewed as a product rather than a process that aids in student learning, the lab report may become rote, busywork for both students and instructors. Students fail to see the purpose of the lab report, and instructors see them as a heavy grading load. If lab reports are taught as part of a process rather than a product that aims to "get the right answer," they may serve as pedagogical tools in college science courses. In response to these issues, an in-depth, web-based tutorial named LabWrite (www.ncsu.edu/labwrite) was developed to help students and instructors (www.ncsu.edu/labwrite/instructors) understand the purpose of the lab report as grounded in the written discourse and processes of science. The objective of this post-test only quasi-experimental study was to examine the role that in-depth instruction such as LabWrite plays in helping students to develop skills characteristic of scientifically literate individuals. Student lab reports from an introductory-level biology course at NC State University were scored for overall understanding of scientific concepts and scientific ways of thinking. The study also looked at students? attitudes toward science and lab report writing, as well as students? perceptions of lab reports in general. Significant statistical findings from this study show that students using LabWrite were able to write lab reports that showed a greater understanding of scientific investigations (p&lt;.003) and scientific ways of thinking (p&lt;.0001) than students receiving traditional lab report writing instruction. LabWrite also helped students develop positive attitudes toward lab reports as compared to non-LabWrite users (p&lt;.01).

The species is a direct link between lower and higher trophic levels and thus serves an important role in the food web. Despite striped mullet?s biological and economic importance, basic life history data from North Carolina are limited and the stock status is unknown. Objectives of this study were to describe striped mullet growth, reproductive seasonality, size and age at maturity, and fecundity. Monthly samples of striped mullet were collected using both fishery independent and dependent sampling strategies throughout North Carolina. Sagittae otoliths were removed and sectioned for age and growth analyses. Gonads were fixed and histologically prepared for maturity indices and fecundity estimation. Length was highly variable within age classes. Regional growth differences within North Carolina were found as fish collected from the southern sampling regions were smaller at age and lived longer than fish from the northern regions. Growth models suggest growth rates in North Carolina were greater than other areas in the species? range. Based on the presence of recently post-spawned fish and gonadal development, striped mullet spawn between late September and December. The collection of a hydrated female less than 1 km from an inlet, coupled with the presence of post-ovulatory follicles from fish sampled within the estuary, provided evidence for near-shore spawning. Males matured at a smaller length (L50) than females, 283 mm and 324 mm fork length, respectively. Fecundity correlated well with fork length (r2=0.88) and body weight (r2=0.91), and ranged from 1193 to 2535 eggs per gram of eviscerated body weight. This study provides the first life history assessment of striped mullet reproduction and growth from North Carolina and shows differences in growth, maturity, spawning location, reproductive seasonality, and fecundity compared to other areas in the species? range.</field><field name="date">2004-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012004-095956/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Greece to Glome: The Christianization of a Pagan Myth</field><field name="creator">Graham, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine the differences between the Cupid and Psyche tale found in Lucius Apuleius?s The Golden Ass and C.S.

Synthesizing scholarship on the construction of audience and tools from critical discourse analysis, I outline three principles for examining the construction of the television audience. Next in Chapter 3, I discuss levels of social organization and the subject positions available in Buffy, examining specific character interactions, paying particular attention to the ways in which power relationships develop within and through the interactions. Then in Chapter 4, I consider the impact of the cultural context and the text's medium on the series.

The transmitter and receiver circuits are designed in TSMC 0.18&#206;&#188;m process technology and can operate at 2.5 Gbps. The power consumption of the design is 5.53 mW at 2.5 Gbps which yields around 2.21 mW.Gb-1.s-1. This design can achieve BER of less than 10-12. The inductive coupling will reduce DC power because the low frequency DC component of the signal will be blocked by coupling inductors. The power consumed by this design is lower than most of the conventional I/Os that use physical contact interconnects.

Parents&#226; behaviors are informed in part by their underlying beliefs about children&#226;s emotions (Dunsmore &amp; Halberstadt, 1997; Halberstadt, Thompson, Parker, &amp; Dunsmore, 2008; Wong, McElwain, &amp; Halberstadt, 2009). Much of the research on emotion socialization beliefs and behavior has combined negative emotions without examining whether there are unique socialization processes for distinct emotions. The goal of the current study was to explore the relationship between parents&#226; beliefs about two distinct emotions, anger and sadness, and parents&#226; socialization behaviors for these two emotions, as well as how parents&#226; beliefs and behaviors relate to children&#226;s affective social competence. In addition, the influence of parent gender, child gender, and ethnicity was assessed.

Dun and Bradstreet (D&amp;B) credit scores, minority status and gender are also added to previous models reported in the literature. My results are: (1) Small firms with longer market experiences will pay lower premium rates over the prime rate and firms with higher risk D&amp;B credit scores will pay higher premiums. These results are both statistically and economically significant. However, the length of bank-borrower relationships does not have a statistically significant effect on the loan rate. Although lines of credit may provide more &#226;soft-information&#226; on borrowers during bank-borrower relationships, banks still put more weight on credit scores and the firms&#226; age. (2) There is no statistically significant relationship between Relationship Characteristics and the probability of collateral requirements. Banks pay more attention to Financial Characteristics and type of ownership. D&amp;B credit scoring system plays a more important role than bank-borrower relationship status. (3) Minority status and gender do not have impacts on loan rates or the probability of pledging collateral.</field><field name="date">2010-04-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012010-131200/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Whitney Museum of American Art: Gender, Museum Display, and Modernism</field><field name="creator">Balcerek, Katherine Emma</field><field name="description">The Whitney Museum of American Art founded in 1931 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney offers insight into the role of women patrons in the American art world. Furthermore, the Museum&#226;s contemporary identification with the Museum of Modern Art obscures its unique history and different founding principles. This paper explores the foundation of the Whitney Museum in roughly the first two decades of its existence from 1931 to 1953 to examine how Whitney and the Museum&#226;s first director, Juliana Force, negotiated gender and class ideology and the Modernist discourse to found the first museum solely devoted to American art. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Juliana Force operated the Whitney Museum based on three main principles: the primacy of the individual artist, the promotion of American art, and the importance of an informal museum space. The Whitney Museum of American Art, staked Whitney and Force&#226;s claim in a male dominated art world. The Museum was a complex space, representing a modern feminine viewpoint that embraced inclusivity and elitism, masculine and feminine, Modernism and conservatism. Whitney and Force wanted the Whitney Museum to be less formal and more inclusive, so they designed it like a middle class home with intimate galleries, furniture, carpets, and curtains. However, the decor hindered the Whitney Museum&#226;s influence on the modern art canon because critics perceived the Museum as feminine and personal, Modernism&#226;s rejection of the feminine and realism that ultimately led to the exclusion of the Whitney Museum&#226;s collection of realist art from the modern art historical canon.</field><field name="date">2010-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012010-131832/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Farm-Retail Price Spread in the U.S. Pork Industry</field><field name="creator">shen, zhangxin</field><field name="description">The farm-retail price spread is the difference between the retail price of a product and its farm value. It changes with changes in factor prices, the efficiency of providing services, and the quantity and quality of services embodied in the final product. A model was derived by Box-Cox transform base on the relative price spread mode for the U.S. pork industry. The new model analyses the determinant of margins more accurately. The results indicate the log of farm-retail price spread is significantly and positively related to increases in log of retail price and log of quantity of farm input. And the relationship between the price spread and industry costs is indeterminate. The results point to the strong possibility of spurious correlation between the price spread and concentration variables. It suggests other possibly unobserved variables correlated with trend are spuriously indicating concentration ratio, has a significant effect on the price spread. Another major implication of this study is that variables used on the regression need to be detrended in estimation.</field><field name="date">2010-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics Co-major in Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012010-133623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of Undergraduates&#226; Stereotypes of Scientists on their Intentions to Pursue a Career in Science</field><field name="creator">Schneider, Jennifer Shields</field><field name="description">Women remain disproportionately represented in certain science, technology, engineering, and math majors and occupations. Stereotypes of scientists may help expose the reasons for this phenomenon. However, this relationship has not yet been empirically examined. This is partly because of the dearth of literature addressing the stereotypes of scientists and the absence of measures aimed at capturing more current concepts of scientists. This research study investigates whether undergraduates&#226; stereotypes of scientists predict their intentions to pursue a career in science. Further, this research examines whether or not science and engineering (S&amp;E) academic majors are likely to have intentions of pursuing a science career and whether or not this relationship varies by gender. A sample of 1639 undergraduates, from diverse universities and academic majors, took a ten-minute online survey assessing their stereotypes of science, academic major, and intention of pursuing a career in a science field. Hierarchical and multiple regression analyses determined undergraduates&#226; stereotypes of scientists and their academic major predict one&#226;s intentions of pursing a science career; however, results did not show that these relationships vary by gender. The strongest predictors of an undergraduate&#226;s intentions of pursuing a science career were their academic major and their stereotypes of scientists&#226; Interpersonal Competencies. A one-way ANOVA found undergraduates&#226; with S&amp;E majors agreed more than non-S&amp;E majors that scientists&#226; have Interpersonal Competencies. Although both males and females perceived scientists as having strong Professional Competencies, females had higher agreement scores for scientists&#226; Professional Competencies than males.</field><field name="date">2010-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012010-145047/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellulose Nanocrystals Reinforced Electrospun Poly(lactic acid) Fibers as Potential Scaffold for Bone Tissure Engineering.</field><field name="creator">Ramirez, Magaly Alexandra</field><field name="description">Poly(lactic acid) / Cellulose Nanocrystals (PLA / CNs) were simultaneously electrospun to fabricate a novel renewable and biocompatible nanocomposite as potential scaffold for bone tissue engineering. CNs were successfully incorporated into the PLA fibers to reinforce the electrospun fiber mat. Thermal, chemical and mechanical analyses were performed to characterize and determine the properties of the scaffold fabricated. Highly porous fibers with fibers diameters in the range of 500-1000 nm were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Crystallinity of the electrospun nanocomposite was studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry. Adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were used to study the cytocompatibility of the nanocomposite scaffold. Life/dead cell assay was performed to determine cell viability of the scaffolds. After one week of cell culture, confocal microscopy indicated that the cells grown on the PLA / CNs nanocomposite were confluent and very well aligned along the fibers while cells cultured on pure PLA fibers were not as confluent as in the developed nanocomposite. This project has demonstrated the feasibility of the fabricated PLA/CNs nanocomposite as a potential scaffold for bone tissue engineering.</field><field name="date">2010-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest Biomaterials Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012010-153822/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Operating System and Application Programming Interface for the EvBot Robot Platform</field><field name="creator">Colon, Micah</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis describes the development of the Linux distribution and a new control architecture for robots.

Recent reduction of load factors used in design of the permanent structure has resulted in less strength availability in the construction stage and need for tools to better support shoring and reshoring analysis. Using the traditional simplified method to analyze loads in a concrete structure under construction, spreadsheet models have been developed which distribute load inputs chosen by the engineer. The models determine the vertical loads resisted by the following shoring systems: one set of shores with either two or three sets of reshores; two sets of shores with either one or two sets of reshores; or three sets of mechanical drophead shores. Analysis can be performed using either unfactored or factored loads and using either actual uniform loads or loads expressed as a proportion of slab dead load, D. Slab liftoff was then analyzed to prevent improper loading conditions during the construction cycle of multistory concrete buildings. The results of the models were validated by comparison with previously published shoring analysis. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis is performed to compare the loads supported by individual slabs and sets of shores in each model during the placement of upper floors.</field><field name="date">2010-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04012010-165640/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal and Non-Thermal Contributions to the X-ray Spectrum of Large Magellanic Cloud Supernova Remnants</field><field name="creator">Hendrick, Sean Patrick</field><field name="description">The study of supernovae and the expanding remnants that form after the explosion is important to understanding star formation and the distribution of elements in the interstellar medium (ISM). In supernova explosions all elements beyond iron are synthesized and then distributed into the ISM, where new star formation is begun in the wake of the explosion. Examining the galactic sample of supernova remnants (SNRs) is limited by absorption and distance uncertainties. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) contains over thirty SNRs at a known distance with little absorption. By examining the X-ray spectrum of a large sample of supernova remnants we can learn how they evolve and how the elements are distributed. This work examines the X-ray spectrum of eleven archival ASCA observations and three new Chandra observations of LMC remnants. The plasma that is responsible for the X-ray emission is heated by a shock wave created by the supernova explosion that expands into the ISM. The picture is further complicated by a reverse shock that is created at the interface between the ISM and the material ejected from the star by the explosion. The ejecta is comprised of elements made by stellar fusion, while the ISM is mostly hydrogen and helium. After the shock passes, the ions contain most of the thermal energy while the electrons are still cold. Coulomb interaction between the ions and electrons behind the shock heat the electrons and continue to ionize the heavy elements, until equilibrium is reached. Non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) models are used to define the thermal contributions to the spectrum. Existing models assume that hydrogen and helium are the sole source of electrons in the plasma. A new NEI model is introduced which accounts for the overabundance of heavy elements in the remnant ejecta and their contribution to the electron density. At each step in the ionization history of the plasma, the ionization fractions of ten elements are determined. This is a plane-parallel shock model that can account for non-Coulomb heating at the shock front and uses shock velocity as a parameter rather than shock temperature. The heavy element model is tested against the current models and used to fit the Chandra observations. Hard, non-thermal tails that are well described by a power law have been observed in the X-ray spectrum of several remnants. Synchrotron radiation observed in the radio regime for low energy electrons can be extrapolated to X-ray energies to account for high energy(&gt; 1 TeV) electrons. By combining X-ray data with radio observation parameters we can constrain the maximum energies of the shock-accelerated electrons in the supernovae above which the electron spectrum must steepen. None of the remnants in this study have a maximum energy above 100 TeV. The heavy element NEI model has proven a valuable tool that will be released to the community. It determined the forward shock velocities of the Chandra observations to be 1018 km/s (0534-69.9), 1080 km/s (0548-70.4) and 1170 km/s (0453-69.5). SNR 0534-69.9 and SNR 0548-70.4 spectra show middle-aged remnants, type II and type Ia explosions respectively, with significant contributions from the ejecta inside the outer shell. The SNR 0453-68.5 observation indicates the presence of a pulsar wind nebula.</field><field name="date">2003-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04022003-001539/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dental Pathology at Promtin Tai: an Iron Age Cemetery from Central Thailand</field><field name="creator">Kirkland, Scott</field><field name="description">The aim of this paper is to further understand the dental health of Thailand and Southeast Asia. An analysis of dental pathology frequencies were conducted using recently excavated remains from the Iron Age site of Promtin Tai in Thailand. Carious lesions, advanced attrition, antemortem tooth loss, and abscessing were scored and the frequencies were then compared to other sites within Thailand. Preliminary work suggests that the overall pathology rate at the Promtin Tai site is lower than other known sites within Thailand. The total caries rate of 0.5 percent at Promtin Tai represents a statistically significant difference in total caries rates between the coastal, central, and Khorat Plateau regions of Thailand. Because this is the first site in the central region to be analyzed for dental pathology, comparisons can only be made to sites of a similar time period from the Khorat Plateau (Eastern Thailand) and coastal Thailand. This new analysis may give insight about how the transition to rice agriculture affects the dentition. It also furthers the knowledge of dental health within Iron Age Thailand and Southeast Asia.</field><field name="date">2010-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04022010-113936/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermionic Emission from Doped and Nanocrystalline Diamond</field><field name="creator">Koeck, Franz Alexander</field><field name="description">Microwave Plasma assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (MPCVD) has been utilized to synthesize nitrogen doped and intrinsic nanocrystalline diamond films to investigate thermionic field emission behavior. Sulfur-doped nanocrystalline diamond films prepared by hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) have been included in the thermionic field emission measurements. The samples were imaged in UHV by photo electron emission microscopy (PEEM) using a UV Hg lamp for photoemission excitation. The same instrument was used to obtain the thermionic-field emission electron microscopy images (T-FEEM) at temperatures up to 900&#186;C. The Raman spectra of the films showed a strong diamond peak at 1332cm-1 and weaker signal from the graphitic regions in the sample. Field emission could not be measured at room temperature, but the PEEM images showed relatively uniform emission. The PEEM images showed little change as the temperature is increased. At temperatures as low as 640&#186;C the T-FEEM images exhibited strongly enhanced electron emission with increasing temperature. Doped and undoped nanocrystalline diamond films showed localized emission from small emission sites with a significant temperature dependence of the electron emission for the sulfur doped films at around 600&#186;C. This thesis focuses on developing a consistent model of thermionic emission from doped and nanocrystalline diamond films.</field><field name="date">2003-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04032003-161449/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Social Context of Inmate Misbehavior: A Contextual Analysis of Infractions in North Carolina Prisons</field><field name="creator">Frazee, Sharon Glave</field><field name="description">Inmate misbehavior is a relatively common phenomenon in correctional facilities throughout the United States.

Production of biologically derived protein products is one of the most rapidly expanding sectors in the global economy. The capture and purification of these products has, of late, become the bottleneck of the industry and can account for approximately 50-80% of the production costs. The biopharmaceutical industry has begun to focus on improving overall economics by merging two or more separation schemes into one. The majority of the emphasis has been on combining the initial protein capture and host cell clearance steps; however, many of the currently available methods have shown little efficacy at large-scale. Additionally, interest in the clearance of pathogenic activity, most importantly infectious prions, from blood and blood derived products has grown over the past decade with the increased threat of blood-transfusion of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This work characterizes the transport and binding properties of a novel hybrid particle-nonwoven membrane medium in which a polymeric chromatographic resin is entrapped between layers of a nonwoven polypropylene membrane (a particle-impregnated membrane or PIM). This membrane-supported resin construct offers the advantage of increased interstitial pore diameter to allow passage of cells and other debris in the feed, while providing sufficiently high surface area for product capture within the resin particles. Columns packed with stacked disks of PIM displayed excellent flow distribution, and had an interstitial porosity of &#206;&#181;b = 0.48 &#194;&#177; 0.01, a 25-60% increase over those typically observed in a packed bed. These columns were able to pass over 95% of E. coli cells and human red blood cell concentrate (RBCC) in 30 column volumes, while maintaining a pressure drop significantly lower than that of a packed bed. The dynamic binding capacity of the chromatographic resin entrapped in the PIM packed column for bovine serum albumin (BSA) was essentially the same as that observed with the same volume of resin in a packed bed. Additionally, the binding of prion was characterized to PIM constructs containing an affinity ligand for PrPSc, in saline, RBCC, and human IgG solutions. The General Rate (GR) model of chromatography was used to analyze experiments indicating that the breakthrough and elution behaviors of the PIM column are predictable, and very similar to those of a normal packed bed. These results indicate that PIM constructs can be designed to process viscous mobile phases containing particulates while retaining the desirable binding characteristics of the embedded chromatographic resin. The PIM systems could find uses in adsorption separation processes from complex feed streams such as whole blood, cell culture, and food processing and could offer a process alternative to expanded beds.</field><field name="date">2009-07-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04042009-120426/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accountable to Whom?: Policymakers? Use of Performance Measurement in Local Economic Development.</field><field name="creator">Lindblad, Mark Richard</field><field name="description">Despite a growing movement toward accountability in the public sector, little research exists on factors affecting the use of accountability tools such as performance measurement. Many publications suggest how to use performance measures, but little is known about why some municipalities use performance measurement whereas others do not. This study examines performance measurement within economic development, an area of local government that attempts to create better jobs and wages for citizens, yet faces growing criticism over its cost and effectiveness. The analysis identifies factors that affect performance measurement in economic development and compares the impact of structural determinants such as demographic and socioeconomic factors to local community choices such as organizational, political, and community forces. Of the local choice variables, performance measurement was most influenced by organizational characteristics of the economic development agency: staff size, budget, plans, partnering, and number of business incentives offered. Structural determinants, which included city expenditures, labor and employer barriers, competition for investment, and region of US, exerted less influence on performance measurement, yet showed that socioeconomic and competitive forces do affect the use of accountability tools. Overall, the findings indicate that in municipal policymaking, both structural constraints and local choices matter, but local choices matter more.</field><field name="date">2004-04-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04052004-181125/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilizing Polyploidy for Developing Improved Nursery Crops: Restoring Fertility in Wide Hybrids, Limiting Fertility of Invasive Species, Embryo Culture of Triploids, Pest Resistance, and Inheritance of Ornamental Traits</field><field name="creator">Olsen, Richard Thomas</field><field name="description">Multiple projects were conducted to investigate the potential for developing a breeding program utilizing species of &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; Scop. and &lt;i&gt;Chilopsis&lt;/i&gt; D.

The efficacy of oryzalin was evaluated for inducing polyploidy and restoring fertility in the sterile, intergeneric hybrid &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa tashkentensis&lt;/i&gt; Elias &amp; Wisura [&lt;i&gt;Catalpa bignonioides&lt;/i&gt;Walt. x &lt;i&gt;Chilopsis linearis&lt;/i&gt; (Cav.) Sweet] 'Pink Dawn'. Submerging meristems in 150 &#181;M oryzalin for up to 24 hours was effective at inducing tetraploids and cytochimeras. Pollen from the diploid cultivar was non-viable, but pollen from the polyploid stained and germinated as well as pollen from progenitor taxa. Polyploid &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt; were self-compatible yielding tetraploids when self pollinated and triploids when crossed with &lt;i&gt;C. bignonioides&lt;/i&gt;, but reciprocal crosses with &lt;i&gt;Chilopsis&lt;/i&gt; taxa failed. To increase recovery of triploids, we investigated germination of ovules and embryos at various harvest dates on Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) basal salts supplemented with various medium components. Germination of triploid [(polyploid &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt;) x &lt;i&gt;C. bignonioides&lt;/i&gt;] and tetraploid (selfed polyploid &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalp&lt;/i&gt;a) embryos was greatest at 7 weeks after pollination on SH with 20 g&#183;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; sucrose and &#8805; 1 &#181;M gibberellic acid (GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Triploids [&lt;i&gt;Chilopsis linearis&lt;/i&gt; x (polyploid &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt;)] germinated &lt; 5%. Additional studies were conducted to screen diverse taxa for resistance to powdery mildew (PM), &lt;i&gt;Erysiphe elevata&lt;/i&gt; (Burr.) U. Braun &amp; S. Takam, and catalpa sphinx larvae (CSL), &lt;i&gt;Ceratomia catalpae&lt;/i&gt; (Boisduval). Twenty-four taxa from &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; (section &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; Paclt and &lt;i&gt;Macrocatalpa&lt;/i&gt; Grisebach), &lt;i&gt;Chilopsis&lt;/i&gt;, and &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt; were screened in 2004-05 for susceptibility to PM. Disease incidence and severity were recorded to calculate area under the disease progress curves (AUDPC) for each year. North American &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; spp. in sect. &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chilopsis&lt;/i&gt;, and &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt; taxa were all moderate to highly susceptible to PM. Chinese &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; spp. in sect. &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; and West Indian sect. &lt;i&gt;Macrocatalpa&lt;/i&gt; were resistant to PM. Hybrids among North American and Chinese &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; spp. in sect. &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt; varied in susceptibility, indicating inheritance of partial resistance to PM. A no-choice feeding study conducted with CSL in 2005 found no differences in survival or growth of larvae reared on taxa from both sections of &lt;i&gt;Catalpa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Chilopsis&lt;/i&gt;, and &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt;. Future breeding of &#215;&lt;i&gt;Chitalpa&lt;/i&gt; can utilize the identified sources of resistance for PM; however, a source of resistance to CSL was not found. Triploids are generally infertile and may be deployed by breeders to limit invasive potential of introduced ornamentals. However, inheritance of ornamental traits can be complex at higher ploidy levels. Inheritance of two mutant foliage types, variegated and purple, was investigated for diploid, triploid and tetraploid tutsan (&lt;i&gt;Hypericum androsaemum&lt;/i&gt; L.). Fertility of progeny was evaluated with pollen viability tests, percent fruit set, and germinative capacity of seed from specific crosses. Segregation ratios were determined for diploids in reciprocal di-hybrid F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BC&lt;sub&gt;1P1&lt;/sub&gt;, and BC&lt;sub&gt;1P2&lt;/sub&gt; families and selfed F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s with the parental phenotypes and triploid and tetraploid F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s. Diploid di-hybrid crosses fit the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio for a single, simple recessive gene for both traits, with no evidence of linkage. A novel phenotype representing a combination of parental phenotypes was recovered. Data from backcrosses and selfing also supported the recessive model. Both traits behaved as expected at the triploid level; however, at the tetraploid level the number of variegated progeny increased, with segregation ratios between random chromosome and random chromatid assortment models. We propose the gene symbol &lt;i&gt;var&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;variegated&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;pl &lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;purple leaf&lt;/i&gt;) for the variegated and purple alleles, respectively. Triploid pollen stained moderately well, but pollen germination was low. Triploid plants demonstrated extremely low male fertility and no measurable female fertility (no viable seed production). Research presented herein demonstrates the feasibility of manipulating ploidy levels for breeding desirable ornamental traits including non-invasiveness.</field><field name="date">2006-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04052006-131144/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talk About Country Clubs: Ideology and the Reproduction of Privilege</field><field name="creator">Sherwood, Jessica Holden</field><field name="description">This dissertation reports on interviews with members of five exclusive country clubs in the Northeastern United States. At these clubs, membership is extended only by selective invitation after a subjective screening process. The clubs have long histories of racial-ethnic homogeneity, but they now display some demographic diversity while preserving the economic and cultural homogeneity with which members are comfortable, and which they consider an important appeal of the private club. I focus on club members' explanations around three topics: their clubs' exclusivity, their racial-ethnic composition, and the status of women members. Subjects minimize the significance of the exclusion they perform by rhetorically pointing to forces beyond their control, and by promoting the American Dream of colorblind, meritocratic equal opportunity. While they use the dominant racial ideology of colorblindness, subjects also show a departure from colorblindness in their active development of and rhetorical emphasis on racial-ethnic diversity in their ranks. Concerning women's status, club members mostly accept the subordination of women in clubs. To justify it, they rhetorically rely on both the dominant gender ideology and the inequalities in men's and women's wealth and domestic responsibilities which originate elsewhere. Club members are called to account for their exclusivity by the American value of egalitarian equal access. But at the same time, other cultural values provide them with the tools needed to successfully explain themselves, even as their talk and actions contribute to the reproduction of class, race, and gender inequalities. This research describes the perspective of wealthy white people, and critiques it as inadequate to a full understanding of the consequences of their actions. It shows how country club members talk and act in ways that help preserve their privileges, and the reasons why they do so.</field><field name="date">2004-04-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04062004-083555/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Processes that Moderate the Effect of Community Structural Factors on Neighborhood Child Maltreatment Rates.</field><field name="creator">Fromm, Suzette Joyce</field><field name="description">This study examined the processes that moderate the effect of community structural factors on neighborhood child maltreatment rates.

A multiple regression was conducted indicating that community stability, the number of adults per child, concentrated disadvantage and child-centered social control predicted child maltreatment rates. Additional regression models indicate that intergenerational closure and reciprocal exchange help to buffer the effects of disadvantage on child maltreatment rates while increasing the rates in affluent communities. There was also indication that child-centered social control buffered the effect of concentrated disadvantage and density while increasing the effect of immigrant concentration on child maltreatment.</field><field name="date">2004-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04062004-230533/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligent Control Using Confidence Interval Networks: Applications to Robust Control of Active Magnetic Bearings</field><field name="creator">Choi, Heeju</field><field name="description">Robust control synthesis requires an explicit mathematical description of the system dynamics (a model) and uncertainty bounds associated with that model. These uncertainty bounds are usually chosen arbitrarily and conservatively for guaranteed stability, frequently at the expense of controller performance. This research demonstrates the application of Confidence Interval Networks (CINs), unique artificial neural networks that utilize asymmetric bilinear error cost functions, for estimating the bounds of model uncertainty required for robust control synthesis. A highly nonlinear and unstable active magnetic bearing (AMB) system is considered. A high-speed flexible rotor supported by AMBs is modeled using analytical approaches, finite element analysis, and system identification. CINs learn the statistical bounds of model uncertainty resulting from unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations. These bounds are incorporated into the synthesis of multivariable robust controllers based on two approaches, linear time invariant and linear parameter varying. Experimental results on a multivariable AMB test rig reveal the benefits of this combination of intelligent system identification and robust control: significant performance improvements vs. conventional robust control with and without mass imbalance (process disturbances).</field><field name="date">2005-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04062005-113722/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">H-RAS AND ITS ONCOGENIC MUTANTS RAS G12V AND RAS Q61L</field><field name="creator">Holsenbeck, Stephanie Leah</field><field name="description">The H-Ras protein is a GTPase important to cell cycle and differentiation.

This study investigated whether glycerol can distinguish changes in the surface due to the mutation. A comparison was made between the wild-type and Q61L mutant H-Ras crystal structures in glycerol and aqueous solution.

Construction sites are a source of accelerated erosion contributing to the sediment problem. This study was conducted to determine if the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) to soil surfaces on construction sites reduces erosion and turbidity. Polyacrylamide has been demonstrated to greatly reduce erosion in furrow irrigation, and there is limited evidence it controls erosion when applied to bare soil. Two PAM products applied at manufacturers recommended rates (11.2 and 1.68 kg ha-1) and one half the recommended rates (5.6 and 0.84 kg ha-1) with and without grass seeding and mulching were tested on three North Carolina Department of Transportation construction sites in Raleigh and near Fayetteville. Runoff volumes, turbidity levels, and eroded sediment data were collected after natural rain events. On a 2:1 cut slope, turbidity and sediment loss were significantly decreased with application of seed/mulch. Erosion rates were 20 times greater on bare soil after seven rain events, with or without PAM, compared to treatments receiving seed/mulch. Polyacrylamide applied with seed/mulch produced slight reductions in turbidity and sediment loss in early rain events. At the higher rate, PAM applied directly on a more moderate, 4:1 fill slope decreased sediment loss and turbidity in the first few rain events following application compared to bare soil, with decreases diminishing over time. A sandy fill slope had inconsistent results between PAM treatments but reductions in turbidity and sediment from seed/mulch applications.</field><field name="date">2003-04-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04072003-143620/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flush</field><field name="creator">Treschl, Sarah H.</field><field name="description">A collection of five original stories.</field><field name="date">2003-04-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04072003-180038/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eugenics and Education: Implications of Ideology, Memory and History</field><field name="creator">Winfield, Ann Gibson</field><field name="description">Eugenics has been variously described "as an ideal, as a doctrine, as a science (applied human genetics), as a set of practices (ranging from birth control to euthanasia), and as a social movement" (Paul 1998 p. 95). "Race suicide" (Roosevelt 1905) and the ensuing national phobia regarding the "children of worm eaten stock" (Bobbitt 1909) prefaced an era of eugenic ideology whose influence on education has been largely ignored until recently. Using the concept of collective memory, I examine the eugenics movement, its progressive context, and its influence on the aims, policy and practice of education. Specifically, this study examines the ideology of eugenics as a specific category and set of distinctions, and the role of rhetoric and collective memory in providing the mechanism whereby eugenic ideology has shaped and fashioned interpretation and action in current educational practice. The formation of education as a distinct academic discipline, the eugenics movement, and the Progressive era coalesced during the first decades of the twentieth century to form what has turned out to be a lasting alliance. This alliance has had a profound impact on public perception of the role of schools, how students are classified and sorted, degrees and definitions of intelligence, attitudes and beliefs surrounding multiculturalism and a host of heretofore unexplored ramifications. My research is primarily historical and theoretical and uses those material and media cultural artifacts generated by the eugenics movement to explore the relationship between eugenic ideology and the institution of education.</field><field name="date">2004-04-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Research and Policy Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04072004-131230/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydroentanglement Process as a Finishing Treatment for the Enhancement of Knitted Fabrics</field><field name="creator">Williams, Stephannia P</field><field name="description">This research involves the application of hydroentangling technology as a means of significantly improving knitted fabric properties.

This study replicates and extends Bruce Western?s research on the impact of incarceration for wage mobility. I integrate Western?s life course approach to examining the impact of incarceration with a discussion of stratification processes that produce inequality in employment and earnings outcomes. I hypothesize that incarceration results in career earnings penalties over and above those associated with foregone human capital accumulation. I suspect that incarceration contributes to a decline in earnings for minority ex-offenders. At the individual level, I replicate Western?s research by estimating fixed-effects models to examine wages across the career trajectories of white, Latino and African American men from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for 1979-1998. When estimating these models, I test whether human capital accumulation that occurs inside or outside the labor market mediates the incarceration-earnings relationship. Furthermore, I examine how local labor market characteristics influence ex-offender career trajectories. I propose that prison records, race/ethnicity and spatial characteristics such as, violent crime rates, unemployment rates, minority concentration, and residential segregation influence the job prospects of workers within metropolitan areas. At the spatial level, I estimate random effects models to examine how local labor market characteristics shape the earnings trajectories of white, Latino and African American male ex-offenders. The individual level results supported the hypotheses that incarceration has a negative effect on earnings and that ex-offenders have lower earnings trajectories than non-offenders. This study did not replicate Western?s finding that the earnings penalty experienced by those who had been incarcerated varies by race/ethnicity. The spatial analysis results suggest that the prison effect on wages is not influenced by the spatial characteristics associated with the local labor market. However, the results indicate that the spatial characteristics of the labor market influence race/ethnicity wage disparities across the career. This study makes a contribution to the existing literature on the consequences of incarceration by linking attributes of ex-offenders, emergent career dynamics and local labor market prospects within a stratification framework.</field><field name="date">2003-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04082003-134952/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age-Related Differences in the use of Diagnostic Information in Social Judgments</field><field name="creator">Leclerc, Christina Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to provide further evidence for a social expertise view of adult age differences in social cognitive functioning. Of specific interest was the extent to which such a perspective can be used to explain the differential use of trait-diagnostic information by young and older adults in the construction of social judgments. The use of such information has been shown to increase with age (Hess &amp; Auman, 2001), suggesting the presence of superior social expertise in older adults when compared to younger adults. In the current research, factors associated with accessibility to relevant knowledge?extremity of trait-relevant behaviors and the amount of diagnostic information?was manipulated to determine if the differences between presumed experts (i.e., older adults) and nonexperts (i.e., younger adults) were attenuated when the salience of trait-diagnostic information was increased. Young, middle-aged, and older adults studied a series of behavioral description describing fictitious target individuals. Study times for individual behaviors contained in these descriptions and impression ratings for each target person were examined. Results of this study replicate past research; specifically, diagnostic information was studied longer and had a stronger impact on impression ratings than did nondiagnostic information, and the impact of diagnosticity increased with age. Further, extreme cues served to enhance the already present diagnostic effects in study time, while also causing ratings of target individuals to be more negatively rated overall. The expected moderation of age differences in the use of diagnostic information based on the extremity of cues did not follow the expected direction. The relationship between age, extremity of cues, and the use of diagnostic information was not significant, suggesting that extremity did not serve to differentially enhance the accessibility of knowledge structures across age groups as originally expected. In addition, larger amounts of diagnostic information actually resulted in greater age differences in the impact of diagnostic information on impression ratings. This, along with the absence of age differences when minimal diagnostic information was available, may suggest that those with expert knowledge are only willing to use it when sufficient cues are presented. I additionally tested an alternative explanation for observed age differences in the use of diagnostic information. Specifically, I investigated whether age differences in implicit beliefs regarding the stability of traits might mediate age differences. No support was obtained for this hypothesis. In sum, although the results were not entirely consistent with expectations, they were generally supportive of an aging-related increase in social expertise as an explanation for age differences in social judgments.</field><field name="date">2003-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04082003-140602/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Simplified Procedure to Predict Dead Load Deflections of Skewed and Non-Skewed Steel Plate Girder Bridges</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Seth T</field><field name="description">Many of today?s steel bridges are being constructed with longer spans and higher skew. As a result, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) has experienced numerous problems in predicting the dead load deflections of steel plate girder bridges. In response to these problems, the NCDOT has funded this research project (Project Number 2004-14). Common dead load deflection prediction methods, which traditionally utilize single girder line (SGL) analysis, have been shown to over predict the dead load deflections; the inaccuracy can result in various costly construction delays and maintenance and safety issues. The primary objective of this research is to develop a simplified procedure to predict dead load deflections of skewed and non-skewed steel plate girder bridges. In developing the simplified procedure, ten steel plate girder bridges were monitored during placement of the concrete deck to observe the deflection of the girders. Detailed three-dimensional finite element models of the bridge structures were generated in the commercially available finite element analysis program ANSYS, and correlations were made between the simulated deflections and the field measured deflections. With confidence in the ability of the developed finite element models to capture bridge deflection behavior, a preprocessor program was written to automate the finite element generation. Subsequently, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of skew angle, girder spacing, span length, cross frame stiffness, number of girders within the span, and exterior to interior girder load ratio on the girder deflection behavior. The results from the parametric were used to develop a simplified procedure, which modifies traditional SGL predictions with empirical equations to account for skew angle, girder spacing, span length, and exterior to interior girder load ratio. Predictions of the deflections from the simplified procedure and from SGL analyses were compared to the deflections predicted from finite element models (ANSYS) and the field measured deflections to validate the procedure. It was concluded that the simplified procedure may be utilized to predict dead load deflections for simple span, steel plate girder bridges. Additionally, an alternative prediction method has been proposed to predict deflections in continuous span, steel plate girder bridges with equal exterior girder loads, and supplementary comparisons were made to validate this method.</field><field name="date">2006-05-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04082006-092019/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-point to single-point service traffic shaping</field><field name="creator">Boloor, Keerthana</field><field name="description">Service providers within an enterprise network are often governed by Client Service Contracts (CSC) that specify, among other constraints, the rate at which a particular service instance may be accessed. The service can be accessed via multiple points (typically middleware appliances) in a proxy tier configuration. The CSC and thus the rate specified have to be collectively respected by all the middleware appliances. The appliances locally shape the service requests to respect the global contract. We investigate the case where the CSC limits the rate to a service to X requests with an enforcement/observation interval of T seconds across all the middleware appliances. In this thesis, we define and evaluate the performance of Credit-based Algorithm for Service Traffic Shaping (CASTS), a decentralized algorithm for service traffic shaping in middleware appliances, in both a simulation and a realistic production level enterprise network setting. We show that CASTS respects the CSC and improves the responsiveness of the system to the variations of the input rate and leads to larger service capacity when compared to the traditional static allocation approach.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Networking</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04082009-190157/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of selection for testosterone production on testicular morphology and daily sperm production in pigs.</field><field name="creator">Walker, Sara Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to determine effects of divergent selection for testosterone on testicular morphology and daily sperm production. Duroc boars from lines divergently selected for testosterone production in response to GnRH challenge for 10 generations followed by random selection were used. In generation 21 endogenous testosterone in the high testosterone line (H, n=54) and low testosterone line (L, n=44) averaged 490 ng/ml and 278 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. Plasma FSH concentrations did not differ between lines (P &lt; 0.3). Body weight, testicular weight, and epididymal weight were recorded for boars from H (n=82) and L (n=44) castrated at an average age of 211 d and 97 kg. Testicular tissues were sampled from animals castrated in generation 20 (H, n=46 and L, n=13). Volume densities for Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, and Sertoli cells were estimated along with sperm production. After adjustment for body weight, average paired testicular weights for H and L were 417 g and 457 g (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. Adjusted epididymal weights also differed between lines (P &lt; 0.02), with H having larger epididymal weights. Line H (n=46) had greater volume densities of Leydig cells than L (n=13) (P &lt; 0.02). Volume density of seminiferous tubules tended to differ between lines (P &lt; 0.07), and Sertoli cell volume densities did not differ (P &lt; 0.27). Sperm production traits, adjusted for age, did not significantly differ between lines. Selection for testosterone production in response to a GnRH challenge was an effective method of changing testosterone levels, testicular size, epididymal weight, and volume density of Leydig cells and seminiferous tubules. However, daily sperm production per gram of testes was unchanged. At this time, selection for testosterone in order to increase sperm production is not recommended.</field><field name="date">2003-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04092003-115030/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Metabolism of Beef Steers Fed Either Gamagrass or Orchardgrass Hay With or Without A Supplement</field><field name="creator">Magee, Kelly Jean</field><field name="description">This experiment evaluated rumen protein:energy synchronization in steers fed either gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides) or orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) hays with or without a soybean hull/corn supplement. A N balance trial was conducted to compare the effects of the supplement and hay on N intake, N digestion, and N metabolism. The supplement consisted of 50:50 corn: soybean hulls mix with 50 g molasses per kg of corn: soybean hulls mixture. The supplement contained 11.3% CP, 34.2% NDF, 22.9% ADF, and 0.87 kg was fed at 0830 and 1600 followed by hay offered in two equal portions. Steers had ad libitum access to water and a trace mineralized salt block throughout the study. Hay compositions were 8.3% CP, 71.8% NDF, and 37.8% ADF for gamagrass and were 11.9% CP, 70.5% NDF, and 36.6% ADF for orchardgrass. Steers were individually fed, blocked into two weight groups, and randomly assigned to either gamagrass or orchardgrass hay (4 steers per hay). Within hays, steers were assigned to receive supplement or no supplement in a crossover design. Ad libitum DM intake for each steer was equal to their intake during the last 8d of the 21-d ad libitum period. Steers were then placed in metabolism crates for an 8-d adjustment followed by a 5-d balance trial. During the balance trial, steers were fed 90% of ad libitum intake. Compared with gamagrass, orchardgrass had similar true IVDMD (64.2 vs 62.2%), similar leaf true IVDMD (58.2 vs 63.2%), and similar stem true IVDMD (46.7 vs 51.7%). Effects were significant at P &lt; 0.10. Compared with gamagrass, orchardgrass had a lower ad libitum DM intake (4.62 vs 5.37 kg/d), higher N intake (96.6 vs 81.1 g/d), similar fecal N (36.1 vs 34.5 g/d), higher N digestibility (62.4 vs 57.4 %), similar N retained (27.2 vs 27.7 g/d), and lower digestible DMI (3.20 vs 3.53 kg/d). Compared with no supplement, supplement increased digestible DM intake (3.70 vs 3.03 kg/d), total DM intake (5.87 vs 5.07 kg/d), N intake (96.9 vs 80.8 g/d), fecal N (39.4 vs 31.1 g/d) and N retained (31.7 vs 23.2 g/d). Supplement (1.74 kg/d) decreased hay ad libitum intake by 0.73 kg/d. Supplement decreased, blood urea N, urine urea N and urine urea N as a percentage of urine N more for orchardgrass than for gamagrass. Supplement tended (P &lt; 0.11) to improve N retained as a percentage of N intake or percentage of N digested more for orchardgrass than for gamagrass hay. Blood urea N was reduced (2.21 vs 0.14 mM)more for steers fed orchardgrass hay than for steers fed gamagrass. We believe that the increase in digestible OM intake is due in part to the presence of soybean hulls in the supplement.</field><field name="date">2004-04-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science/Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04092004-175002/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Dual Functional Textile Materials Using Atmospheric Plasma Treatments</field><field name="creator">Mittal, Khushboo Surender</field><field name="description">Glow discharges and low temperature plasmas and their applications have increasingly entered various areas of industrial applications.

TNF also causes apoptosis in certain transformed cell lines and cells that are infected with certain viruses or intracellular bacteria. Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is an inflammatory enzyme that mediates its activities, by specifically catalyzing the release of arachidonic acid leading to the generation of eicosanoids. The activity of cPLA2 is necessary during TNF-induced apoptosis and the goal of this study was to identify signals that mediate the activation of cPLA2 during cell death. Intracellular calcium and phosphorylation are well documented to activate cPLA2 under many inflammatory conditions. Therefore, I examined the ability of these signals to regulate cPLA2 during TNF-induced apoptosis. I first examined calcium levels during the TNF-induced apoptosis of C3HA fibroblasts and determined that an influx of extracellular calcium occurs early during cell death. This influx, as well as the release [3H]arachidonic acid, was blocked by verapamil indicating that the calcium response is necessary for the activation of cPLA2 during this process. To analyze the effects that phosphorylation has during TNF-induced apoptosis, cPLA2 proteins, containing serine phosphorylation site mutations, were stably overexpressed in WM793 melanoma cells. Although PMA was able to enhance the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from cells that overexpressed cPLA2, the treatment of the same cells with TNF and cycloheximide had no effect. However, subsequent experiments using PMA demonstrated novel roles for the phosphorylation of Ser-437 and ?727. One was an activation role for Ser-437 as its phosphorylation enhanced [3H]arachidonic acid release. The other was an inhibitory role for the phosphorylation of Ser-727 as its mutation suppressed the release in response to PMA. In conclusion, though the activation of cPLA2, by calcium responses, during apoptotic and non-apoptotic systems is consistent, the regulation of cPLA2 by phosphorylation may involve both positive and negative regulatory signals.</field><field name="date">2004-04-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102004-174824/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tree Composition Along Edaphic and Hydrologic Gradients in Nonriverine Wet Hardwood Forests</field><field name="creator">Morris, Tracy Catharine</field><field name="description">We sampled seven intact nonriverine wet hardwood forests to establish target ranges for vegetation, soils and hydrology and to examine trends in plant species composition along a wetness gradient. Although quantitative vegetation analysis for this community has been published, broad drainage classes were used to represent a moisture gradient. We investigated trends along a finer-scaled wetness gradient utilizing a novel wetness index that incorporated indicators of saturated soils. Understanding small-scale patterns in plant community composition is useful in planning wetland restoration projects. Although no strong relationship was found between wetness index classes and plant community composition, these data represent the vegetative community supported by soils specific to each wetness class. Absence of this relationship is most likely a result of the dominance of A. rubrum and L. styraciflua in all wetness classes as well as a history of disturbance in each forest and other unknown stochastic variables. For the restorationist hoping to restore a historic nonriverine wet hardwood forest, once known as oak flats, we can suggest guidelines for restoring hydrology to the wetness classes in which we found oaks with high importance.</field><field name="date">2005-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102005-161445/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examination of the Strontium Catalysis of Hydrino Reactions in a Capacitively-Coupled Audio-Frequency Cylindrical Plasma Discharge.</field><field name="creator">Nowak, Joshua Michael</field><field name="description">Strontium catalysis may be an important aspect of a novel method of power production involving hydrino reactions.

Most results were inconclusive, but it was clear that plasmas with 1.01% H had a marked increase in thermal output when Sr was added. This means that there may be strontium catalysis of the hydrino process in this case and further experimentation should be done to rule out other explanations for this increase.</field><field name="date">2009-05-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04102009-130523/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of the Metal Foam Electrical Resistance Heater</field><field name="creator">Cookson, Edward James</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a novel concept using a radial heating element made from porous Fe-Cr-Al metal foam in an air heater. Electrical resistance heating has been used extensively to convert the electrical energy into thermal energy. An analytic heat transfer model is first developed to estimate dimensions of the heating element. Four prototype Fe-Cr-Al metal foam electrical heaters with different levels of porosity and density are built. A more detailed computational fluid dynamics modeling of prototype heaters to include the temperature loss to the surroundings is developed. Experiments were conducted to evaluate effects of airflow rates and electrical current and measure the change of air inlet and outlet temperatures. The temperature rise in the airflow is directly proportional to electric current, and inversely proportional to the weight density of the foam. The temperature appears directly proportional to airflow rate in low density foams, while it is inversely proportional in foams of higher relative density. Experimental temperature measurements show reasonable agreement with modeling predictions. Finally, possible improvements to the initial concept are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04112003-105028/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of organic acids and pH on the virulence factor expression of E. coli O157:H7.</field><field name="creator">Adhikari, Sahana Das</field><field name="description">Acidification is used as a hurdle in many minimally processed foods. Decreased pH (pH 5.5) may enhance survival and virulence factor expression of E. coli O157:H7 (EC). The objective of this research was to determine the effect of different organic acids and pH on the expression of three virulence factor genes (stx2, hlyA, eaeA) in EC. Gene fusions containing the lacZ gene inserted into the stx2, eaeA or hlyA genes were created in E. coli O157:H7 with and without a functional rpoS gene. Overnight cultures were inoculated into tryptic soy broth acidified with citric, malic, lactic, or hydrochloric acid at pH 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, or 4.5 or apple juice (pH 3.5). Cell growth characteristics were characterized, and &#946;-galactosidase activity of stressed or control cells (neutral pH, no acid) was subsequently determined to follow virulence factor production. Production of all three virulence factors was increased at pH 5.5 or 5.0 compared to production at neutral pH (p&lt;0.05). Acid type impacted production of EaeA and StxII, but had no effect on HlyA. Production of StxII and HlyA was not detected in apple juice. At pH 5.5, cell growth was slowest in lactic acid, followed by malic and citric acids then HCl. At pH 5.0, the slowest growth was observed in citric acid, followed by malic acid, lactic acid and HCl. At pH 4.5, no growth occurred in citric, malic and lactic acids, and cell numbers decreased over a period of 5 days. In HCl at pH 4.5, cells grew slowly and increased by 2 logs over a 5-day period. Sublethal acid stress impacts virulence factor expression of E. coli O157:H7 and these effects are impacted by pH and acid type.</field><field name="date">2005-04-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04112005-101842/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reassessment: A Mummy Shroud from the North Carolina Museum of Art</field><field name="creator">Dopko, Cynthia Hogan</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to reassess the dating and iconography of a Roman period mummy shroud entitled, Mummy Portrait of a Young Man from the Fayum, in the collection of the North Carolina Museum of Art. This reevaluation benefited greatly from the recent international scholarship and museum exhibitions done on mummy portraits from Roman Egypt in the past few years. The research for the North Carolina shroud involved analyzing, in detail, the unique symbolic arrangement depicted on the shroud by evaluating each of the object?s four registers individually as well as assessing the composition as a whole. This research found that the symbolic content of the shroud, as a whole, possesses a cohesive iconographical message. The registers of the shroud depict the individual, his mummification, revivification, and subsequent rebirth into an afterlife, if read from top to bottom. Further, this research has concluded that the numerous symbols on the shroud support this ritual transformation as well as point to its relationship with the Isiac or Serapion mystery cult. The fourth century date of this shroud has been redated to the third century and the stylistic features of the shroud?s design point to an Er-Rubayat provenance. It is hoped that this research will benefit the North Carolina Museum of Art, and enter this mummy shroud into the on-going international scholarship on mummy portraits from Roman Egypt.</field><field name="date">2004-04-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122004-163107/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of Bridges and Culverts on Stream Fish Movement and Community Structure</field><field name="creator">Vander Pluym, Jennifer L.</field><field name="description">This study was part of a larger, more comprehensive project assessing the effects of culvert designs on freshwater mussel habitat. Because many freshwater mussels depend on an obligate relationship with certain fish hosts to complete their life cycle as well as sole mechanism for dispersal, it is critical to identify obstacles to fish movement that, in turn, could negatively impact dispersal success of mussels. The primary goal of our study was to quantify the impact of four commonly used road crossings (bridge, arch culvert, box culvert, and pipe culvert) on stream fish abundance and diversity, as well as movement. We conducted a mark-recapture study in 16 streams located in the Piedmont region of the Cape Fear River Basin of North Carolina during the summer of 2004. Following electrofishing surveys, all fish were identified to species and measured to the nearest millimeter. Fish &#161;&#220; 30 mm total length (TL) were individually marked elastomer paint. These procedures were repeated four, eight, and 12 weeks after the initial sampling period. With the exception of species richness, all response variables: estimates of population size, species diversity, fish index of biotic integrity (FIBI), and Conditional Percent Movement (CPM) did not vary significantly with crossing type, position (upstream and downstream), or month. Downstream reaches of box culverts contained significantly higher species richness of stream fish than other crossing types. High diversity of stream fish downstream of box culverts may have been due to a scouring effect common below box and pipe culverts which results in pool formation and a possible change from benthic to pool fish species on a local level. The general lack of stream fish abundance and diversity responses to road crossings may be due to: the insensitivity of stream fish community variables (FIBI and diversity index) to anthropogenic effects, the overall resilience of fish communities, or the shifting baseline theory--fish communities having shifted to an impacted community prior to sampling. There were extremely low numbers of individuals that moved between stream reaches in the first study, therefore we conducted a second mark-recapture study using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags with remote antenna arrays on six streams, three streams with bridges and three streams with box culverts, during the summer of 2005. We surveyed each stream using electrofishing and marked all fish measuring &#161;&#221; 60 mm TL with an ISO PIT tag. Custom built antenna arrays, with weir nets to direct fish passage through the antenna loop, were installed in each stream either upstream or downstream of a given crossing and detected tagged fish continuously for 30 days. Estimates of mean percent movement of fish through box culverts (28.27% &#161;&#192; 12.24% SE) was almost half that of bridges (44.35% &#161;&#192; 8.77% SE); however, the percent tagged fish detected by the antenna for bridges and culverts showed no significant difference between the two crossing types. These results suggest that a larger study might detect a significant difference in fish movement through culverts as opposed to bridges. This application of PIT tags and remote antenna arrays proved a more effective and efficient use of research funding to assess stream fish movement through culverts and we recommend the antenna systems for further non-game fish research.</field><field name="date">2006-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122006-164256/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It?s Greek to Me: The Politics and Shape of Greek-American Identity</field><field name="creator">Boukourakis, Angela</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine how native Greeks and first-generation Greek-Americans identify or disidentify with ?Greek-ness,? ?American-ness,? or both in their struggle to achieve an ultimate, successful balance of a third ?space,? one that expresses their Greek-American identity. In order to come to certain conclusions regarding the formation of Greek-American identity, I examine Greek-American life from a historical overview that spans as early as the first Greek-American communities of the early 1900?s, to Greek-Americans of present-day society. I look at how Greek-Americans perform ?Greek-ness,? ?American-ness,? or ?Greek-American-ness,? through language choice and the altering of traditional gender roles, in an attempt to achieve the third ?space? of ?Greek-American-ness.? I discuss their use of Greek and English languages in the first chapter of the thesis from a qualitative, sociolinguistics study I conducted in spring 2003. In addition I examine females? and males? altering of traditional gender roles, and their implications, in several Greek-American texts, including Helen Papanikolas?s novel, The Time of the Little Blackbird, and her story collection, The Apple Falls from the Apple Tree, Nia Vardalos?s film, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Nick Gage?s memoir, A Place for Us, and Eleni N. Gage?s memoir, North of Ithaka: A Journey Home through a Family?s Extraordinary Past, for the purposes of this thesis. These texts most effectively illustrate the altering of traditional gender roles and the affects of interethnic marriage. I found that the definitions of Greeks and Greek-Americans have always been ambiguous. Furthermore, Greek-American identity continues to be so in contemporary America, as a result of white, American socio-historical and socio-cultural constructs of race and ethnicity. Other findings include the fact that American-born and Greek-born Greek-Americans consider themselves different from other Americans, as well as from the Greeks who live in Greece. Both groups express their ?Greek-American-ness? through language choice, altering of traditional gender roles, and lifestyle patterns characteristic of American life. Both males and females successfully achieve the third ?space? of Greek-American identity in contemporary America. However, from a historical perspective, males assimilated more easily, and more often, than females. In addition, it took females much longer than the males to achieve this third ?space,? because of Greek traditional gender roles, which automatically allowed males more freedom for self-definition than the females, as a result of Greek patriarchal society in which these original roles were constructed. Finally, contemporary Greek-Americans are assimilating more than ever before, since influx of Greek migration patterns has significantly slowed down, from the last working class group who came in the early 1980?s. This is probably the last group of first-generation Greek-Americans, so assimilation will become even more prevalent amidst later generations with the passing of time, unless Greek-Americans find ways to preserve their history and culture. This is why it is important to unearth Greek-American immigrant literature currently out of print, and to continue to write about the Greek-American experience, so future generations have a way to connect to their cultural origins and embrace the history that sets them apart as distinctively Greek-American.</field><field name="date">2006-04-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122006-172257/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time Contaminant Source Characterization in Water Distribution Systems</field><field name="creator">Liu, Li</field><field name="description">Accidental/intentional contamination continues to be a major concern for the security management in water distribution systems. Once a contaminant has been initially detected, an effective algorithm is required to recover the characteristics of the contaminant&#226;s source based on dynamically varying streams of sensor observations. This dissertation focuses on the development and demonstration of a new algorithm to characterize a contaminant source quickly, accurately, and robustly. An evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based adaptive dynamic optimization technique (ADOPT) is proposed, potentially providing a real-time response. In addition to offering adaptive capacity in a dynamic environment, this algorithm is able to assess the degree of non-uniqueness in the solution through multi-population scheme. This approach, however, requires a large number of time-consuming simulation runs to evaluate possible solutions, and it may be difficult to converge on the best solution or a set of alternative solutions within a reasonable computational time. For this reason, it is desirable to appropriately reduce the decision space over which the optimization procedure must search to reduce the computational burden and to produce faster convergence. A logistic regression-based prescreening technique is investigated in order to reduce the decision space by estimating the probability of a node being a contaminant source location. When a small set of potential source nodes are identified, applying the local search procedure to this set of locations is computationally efficient and potentially good at identifying the best solution. The EA-based ADOPT is then integrated with a logistic regression analysis and a local improvement method to expedite the convergence and to solve the problem potentially faster. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated for contamination source identification problems in two illustrative water distribution networks.</field><field name="date">2009-05-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04122009-193753/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not Now, Maybe Later, and Often Not at All: Situational, Institutional, Dispositional, Epistemological, and Technological Barriers to Business-Based Online Training Courses</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Linda Enders</field><field name="description">The purpose of the research was to determine whether the situational, institutional, dispositional, epistemological, and technological barriers that affect attrition in distance education apply to the business-based distance training arena.

Interleukin (IL)-13 is a central mediator in the pathogenesis of inflammatory airway diseases playing a significant role in epithelial remodeling. In this study, we examined mechanisms through which IL-13 induces proliferation of normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells maintained in air/liquid interface culture in vitro, a model that allows for the maintenance of differentiated structure and function. It was found that IL-13-induced proliferation of NHBE cells is mediated by the autocrine/paracrine action of transforming growth factor-a (TGFa) that is produced by the epithelial cells and subsequently binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on these cells. IL-13-induced release of TGFa involves the rapid mobilization of intracellular stores of TGFa to the apical cell surface, where membrane bound TGFa is cleaved by tumor necrosis factor-a converting enzyme (TACE), resulting in released growth factor. Both neutralizing anti-TGFa antibodies and the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 block IL-13-induced proliferation in concentration-dependent manners. Additionally, IL-13 induces the activation of the mitogen activated (MAP) kinase pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, both of which are required for IL-13-induced proliferation. However, activation of the MAP kinase pathway by IL-13 does not appear to be TGFa mediated, as neutralizing anti-TGFa antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have little effect on IL-13-induced MAP kinase. PI3K was found to be involved in IL-13-induced release of TGFa as the specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, blocks release of the growth factor. In summary, IL-13-induced proliferation of NHBE cells involves the intracellular redistribution and subsequent TACE-mediated release of TGFa, an event mediated by PI3K. This proliferation then involves the interaction of TGFa with the EGFR and requires activation of both the MAP kinase and the PI3K signaling cascades. These data establish a mechanistic framework for further study into the effects of IL-13 on bronchial epithelial cells as well as additional cell types that may interact with IL-13, or growth factors induced by this cytokine, in an in vivo setting.</field><field name="date">2004-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04132004-101835/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary Communication: Discoure and Form in the Poetry of James Merrill and John Ashbery</field><field name="creator">McGowan, Catherine-Anne Calhoun</field><field name="description">Although James Merrill and John Ashbery approach poetry from very different stylistic angles, the themes that emerge from their work have numerous similarities. Each poet illustrates how classic form has evolved to fit into contemporary context in poems such as ?Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape? and ?To a Pocket Calculator,? as well as commenting on this evolution in works such as ?Watching the Dance,? ?Litany? and ?The Songs We Know Best.? After laying the groundwork of formal change, Merrill and Ashbery discuss how this stylistic evolution is mirrored in the day to day life of our fast-paced contemporary society. In poems such as ?Eight Bits? and ?Self-Portrait in Tyvek? Windbreaker,? James Merrill expresses disgust and skepticism with the state of society today, while John Ashbery addresses the need for rebirth in an oppressive landscape in ?It Was Raining in the Capital.? Both poets reveal their own feelings of insecurity and self-doubt in ?Business Personals? and ?Family Week at Oracle Ranch,? poems that are simultaneously nostalgic for the past and optimistic about the future. Exploring these themes sheds new light on postmodernism?s blending of high and low culture. The examination of each poet?s work from a formal and contextual perspective is essential in understanding the need for preservation of both artistic and emotional values of the past in order to have a successful future.</field><field name="date">2004-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04132004-103021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fertility and the sperm membrane biomarker (SP22) are compromised in an additive fashion by priority disinfection by-products of drinking water: a validation of enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) for SP22.</field><field name="creator">Kaydos, Emilie Hayes</field><field name="description">Dibromoacetic acid (DBA) and bromochloroacetic acid (BCA) are prevalent disinfection by-products of drinking water known to produce defects in spermatogenesis and fertility in adult rats. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that BCA compromises both the fertility of cauda epididymal sperm and SP22, a sperm membrane protein highly correlated with the fertility of these sperm. Herein, we administered DBA and BCA, individually and in combination, to determine whether levels of SP22 on sperm and fertility were diminished in an additive fashion. Moreover, we wished to validate an immunoassay for quantitation of SP22 to replace the tedious two-dimensional (2D) gels quantitation. The initial study consisted of 8 treatment groups and a water vehicle control group, on which animals were exposed by oral gavage daily for 14 days. BCA was administered alone at 1.6, 4, and 8 mg/kg, and DBA was given in equimolar fashion at 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg. BCA and DBA were also given as two binary mixtures: 1.6 mg/kg BCA + 2 mg/kg DBA and 4 mg/kg BCA + 5 mg/kg DBA. Proximal cauda epididymal sperm membrane proteins (30 &#236;g) were resolved following concentration/desalting in 2D gels under denaturing conditions (2D SDS-PAGE) and the SP22 protein was quantified. In addition, SP22 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). Full length rat recombinant SP22 (rSP22) was used to generate a standard curve and affinity purified sheep anti-rSP22 was used as primary antibody. The ED50 for the decrease in SP22 quantified by 2D SDS-PAGE for DBA and BCA was 7.15 and 4.61 mg/kg. The ED50 for the decrease in SP22 quantified by ELISA for DBA and BCA was 8.10 and 5.93 mg/kg. The second study consisted of 2 and 4 mg/kg DBA, 1.6 and 3.2 mg/kg BCA, and a 2 mg/kg DBA + 1.6 mg/kg BCA mixture. In this study proximal cauda sperm were also used for in utero insemination to assess fertility. The ED50 for the decrease in fertility for DBA and BCA was 3.5 and 2.7 mg/kg. Immunostaining for SP22 in the testis revealed staining of both round and elongating spermatids and decreased staining in testes exposed to the DBA + BCA mixture. An evaluation of SP22 in testicular parenchyma was also performed by ELISA and Western blotting. Both evaluations revealed a treatment-related decrease in SP22. For either the 2D SDS-PAGE or ELISA quantitation of SP22 on sperm or the fertility of sperm, additivity or synergy is indicated. Finally, the correlation between SP22 levels measured by ELISA versus fertility was r2=0.74, compared to 0.82 for SP22 levels measured by 2D SDS-PAGE versus fertility, suggesting the ELISA could be used to supplant the time-intensive SDS-PAGE.</field><field name="date">2004-04-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04132004-133325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">L(Infinity) Structures on Spaces of Low Dimension</field><field name="creator">Daily, Marilyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">L(Infinity) structures are natural generalizations of Lie algebras, which need satisfy the standard graded Jacobi identity only up to homotopy.

There are three specific phases of analysis. First, exploratory factor analysis is conducted to create a typology of infractions. Second, a Markov model is created to examine the extent of infraction specialization. Finally, hierarchical linear modeling logistic regression is used to both discover how three theories ? prisonization, importation and social control ? predict the occurrence of the different infractions types identified in the first phase of the analysis and as well as to help partially validate the infraction typology presented. Hierarchical linear modeling logistic regression results indicate that there are different predictors for the different infraction types, supporting the need to distinguish between them. Further, the Markov Model used to examine change of behavior over time supports limited specialization in infraction careers and shows that infraction behavior is not random. Overall, there is moderate support for the proposed typology and for the presence of specialization in infraction careers.</field><field name="date">2007-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04132007-124827/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic tremor at the 9&#194;&#176;50&#226;N East Pacific Rise eruption site.</field><field name="creator">Monigle, Patrick W</field><field name="description">Ocean bottom seismic observations within the 9&#194;&#176;50&#226; N region of the East Pacific Rise indicate persistent, low-amplitude tremor activity throughout the October 2003 through February 2007 period of monitoring. These signals exhibit either mono- or polychromatic spectral characteristics, with a ~6 Hz fundamental frequency and up to two harmonics. Individual events cannot be correlated between nearby (&lt;1 km) stations, implying the presence of multiple, small-amplitude sources positioned within the shallow crust. Tremor exhibits a semi-diurnal periodicity, with some stations recording activity during times of increasing tidal extension and others detecting tremor signals during times of increasing compression. The amplitude, duration, and rate of activity also correlate positively with fortnightly changes in the amplitude of the tides. These spatio-temporal patterns are consistent with tremor generation in response to tidally modulated fluid flow within a network of shallow cracks. Tremor energy flux is spatially and temporally heterogeneous; however, there are extended periods of greater and lesser activity that can be tracked across portions of the array. Despite their shallow crustal origin, changes in tremor amplitude and spectral character occur in the months prior to a major microearthquake swarm and inferred seafloor spreading event on 22 January 2006, with an increase in the degree of correlation between tremor activity and tidal strain observed in the weeks leading up to this event. After the spreading event, two eruption-surviving stations near the axis continue to show high rates of tremor activity; whereas, these signals are suppressed at the single station recovered from the near-axis flanks. This off-axis quiescence may result from the dike-induced closing of cracks, or perhaps from the emplacement of impermeable flows near the station.</field><field name="date">2009-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04132009-125656/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of copper oxide needles on gastrointestinal parasites in grazing meat goats</field><field name="creator">Glennon, Heather Mary</field><field name="description">Gastrointestinal (GI) parasitism may be the most challenging health problem associated with raising goats. Two trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of copper (Cu) oxide needles (CuON) on trichostrongylid parasites in grazing Boer-cross yearling goats. In trial 1, 18 does and 18 wethers (40 kg BW) were stratified by fecal egg counts (FEC) and sex, and sorted into 6 groups of 6 animals in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications. On d 0, control (CTL) goats received a combined dose of fenbendazole (10 mg/kg BW) and levamisole (11 mg/kg BW) whereas treated goats received a 5 g CuON bolus. In trial 2, 45 wethers (48 kg BW) were stratified by FEC and randomly assigned to 1 of 9 groups of 5 animals each in a RCBD with 3 replications. Treatments were 0 g (CTL), 5 g, or 10 g of a CuON bolus. In both trials, goats were rotationally grazed in separate bermudagrass/crabgrass plots. Fecal and blood samples were taken every 7 d. Liver samples and the abomasum (trial 2 only) were taken when animals were sacrificed on d 77 (trial 1) and d 59, 60 and 63 (trial 2). In trial 1, FEC were lower (P &lt; .06) for CuON goats on d 31 (2,426 vs 4,115 eggs/g feces).

Liver Cu concentrations were higher (P &lt; .044) in CuON goats (395 vs 138 mg/kg DM). Liver lesions and plasma Cu concentrations did not differ. In trial 2, FEC were higher (P &lt; .01) in CTL than 10g CuON goats on d 14 (CTL: 4117; 5 g: 2795; 10 g: 1768 eggs/g feces). Goats on 10 g CuON had lower (P &lt; .04) PCV on d 14 (CTL: 31.3; 5 g: 32.4; 10 g: 29.1%). Liver Cu concentrations increased linearly (P &lt; .01) (CTL: 92; 5 g: 296; 10 g: 386 mg/kg DM). Total protein, plasma Cu concentrations, liver lesions and number of Haemonchus contortus or Trichostrongylus axei found in the abomasum were similar. Although CuON have the potential to become part of an integrated internal parasite program, additional research is needed before CuON can be recommended as a safe and effective anthelmintic.</field><field name="date">2004-04-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04142004-152506/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating Division I Collegiate Academic Support Programs: The Student Athletes?

Fixed-effects analysis suggests using relative care decreases mother?s hours of employment per week. Once age of the youngest child is introduced, nuclear care decreases mother?s hours of employment per week. Surprisingly, mothers of infants and toddlers are predicted to work slightly more hours per week than mothers of preschoolers. Husband?s hours of employment per week interacts with non-family care to decrease mother?s hours of employment. The effect of the number of children in the household on mother?s hours of employment is found to depend on the childcare utilized. Interestingly, mother?s years of education and husband?s annual income do not have statistically significant effects on mother?s hours of employment in this analysis. Some possible reasons and implications of these findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04152003-150122/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When 'A Man' Becomes 'A Husband': Relationship Status and Transition and the Division of Household Labor</field><field name="creator">Gerteisen, Jennifer Parks</field><field name="description">Data from both waves of the National Survey of Families and Households were used to examine differences between three relationship types in the division of household labor. Respondents were assigned to three groups: continuously married to the same partner (n = 5,035); continuously cohabiting with the same partner (n = 125); and transitional, from cohabiting to married, with the same partner (n = 216; total sample size = 5,376). The proportional contributions to hours spent on feminine (cooking, laundry, cleaning), masculine (outdoor tasks, auto repair), and neutral (running errands, paying bills) household tasks by male and female partners were examined for all relationship types. T-tests and OLS regression were used to determine differences between groups, and factors which impact proportional contributions at each wave of the survey. In addition, changes in contributions to each task type by male and female partners over time were examined in the context of group membership and other factors. Women in all groups contribute more to the feminine task hours than their male partners. When no controls are included, transitional males contribute significantly more than do continuously married men to the feminine task hours at both waves, and transitional women contribute significantly less than do continuously married women at the first wave. Transitional males decrease their contributions to feminine task hours between waves, and continuously married males increase their contributions to feminine task hours between waves. Transitional women increase their contributions to feminine task hours and continuously married women decrease theirs between waves. When controls for age, gender, gender ideology, number of children in the household, income, and education are included, there is no longer a significant difference between transitional and continuously married males? contributions to feminine task hours at the second wave. Changes in proportional contributions to feminine task hours differ significantly between transitional and continuously married men, and between transitional and continuously married women. Also significantly impacting these changes, although the effects are small in magnitude, are gender, change in gender ideology between waves, and education. These results suggest that the shift from cohabitation to marriage does carry with it normative, gendered expectations about the allocation of housework. However, continuously married men increase, and continuously married women decrease, their contributions to feminine household tasks?a finding which is unexpected and suggests the possibility of separate mechanisms which operate in the context and over the course of marriage. A lack of consistent effects for comparisons involving the continuously cohabiting group indicates heterogeneity within this group, and a need for future research to more clearly delineate types of long-term cohabitors.</field><field name="date">2003-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04152003-193313/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Situational Factors and Domestic Assault Laws on Juvenile Arrests for Assault</field><field name="creator">Tichavsky, Lisa</field><field name="description">Between 1996 and 2005, Uniform Crime Reports show an increase in girls&#226; arrests for assaults. Previous research has suggested two possible reasons for this increase. Some suggest that girls are becoming more violent, while others argue that increases in girls&#226; arrests for assaults may be an artifact of changes in parents&#226; and police response to girls&#226; conflicts in the home. To test these possibilities, this study uses data for 445 agencies (N=128,787) which continuously reported to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) during the years 1996-2005 and information on state domestic violence arrest laws. Bivariate analyses, which assessed the patterns of female violence across years, failed to find evidence of increasing female violence. Through logistic regression analyses, support is found for increasing social control practices despite the fact that after controlling for injury, weapon use, and other characteristics of the incident, state arrest policies appear to equally increase the odds of arrest for boys and girls. Further, an unexpected finding is that African American girls were more likely to be arrested than white girls until arrest laws were introduced into the model indicating that the effect of race was mediated by domestic violence laws. Directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-06-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04152008-173751/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Porchlight Trio</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Gregory Hillard</field><field name="description">This original screenplay is a musical drama about three main characters in a small Southern town.

Groundwater samples were collected with a Bennett pump from 7 wells that lie along a trend roughly parallel to groundwater flow (at least, predevelopment groundwater flow). 14C, 13C, DIC, DOC, He, Ne, Ar, N2, O2, CO2, CH4, H2, 3H, S, Fe, Al, Mn, Si, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4-, and NO3- were measured in all samples. Estimation of groundwater age involved inverse mass balance modeling with NETPATH to account for geochemical reactions (calcite dissolution, organic matter oxidation, and cation exchange) affecting 14C activity in groundwater, as well as a separate correction to account for loss of 14C by diffusion into contiguous aquitards. 14C groundwater ages were 580, 10700, 19100, and greater than 35300 years old at four wells in the Black Creek aquifer, and 15100, 26900, and 31100 years old at three wells in the Upper Cape Fear aquifer. These groundwater ages, together with falling heads, suggest that groundwater withdrawals in these aquifers represent a sort of ?mining.? He concentration in groundwater increased with 14C groundwater age with one exception (a sample very high in He concentration from the Upper Cape Fear where it directly overlies crystalline basement rocks). Groundwater from 6 of the wells had 3H concentrations that are consistent with the presence of young water, but it is uncertain whether the 3H in these wells is from relict drilling fluid, downward leakage along the well casings, or a more broadly distributed downward leakage.</field><field name="date">2004-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04162004-145829/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Race, Region, and Rurality: Implications for Educational Attainment</field><field name="creator">Pickett, Robert Louis</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to improve the understanding of the social factors influencing educational attainment.

Other bodies of educational research have shown that residents of the South have had persistently lower levels of educational attainment than any other major region of the country. Furthermore, similar research has revealed that residents of rural areas also tend to have lower educational attainment than other residential areas. As it turns out, the highest concentration of African Americans and the highest concentration of rural Americans, reside in the South.

The bioreactor was conceived as a tool for the shear-based control of activated sludge floc particle size in batch and continuous-run experiments. Initial experiments on the feasibility of cultivating aerobic granular sludge in the bioreactor are described. The bioreactor was found to experience turbulent Taylor vortex flow, rather than laminar Couette flow, at all rotational speeds tested. This flow regime is the result of inner cylinder rotation. Despite turbulent flow conditions, the bioreactor was found to behave approximately as a plug-flow device when not aerated, and as a complete-mix reactor when aerated. Floc size control was found to depend on bioreactor rotational speed for two sludges tested, with higher rotational speed leading to smaller particle size. Three experimental attempts at aerobic granular sludge cultivation in the annular gap bioreactor are described in this study. Although none of the three attempts was successful at producing aerobic granules, the experiments allowed critical control issues related to bioreactor operation and influent composition to be identified and addressed. The Bacterial and Eukaryal population dynamics during each run were tracked with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and rDNA sequence analysis, using methods developed or streamlined in the course of this research. The foundational work described in this study culminated in the development of a series of protocols and recommendations for the next phase of aerobic granular sludge investigation with this novel annular gap bioreactor.</field><field name="date">2005-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172005-142501/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and Professional Experience as Predictors of Consultants' Likelihood of Use of Social Power Bases</field><field name="creator">Getty, Kimberly Chapman</field><field name="description">The social power typology originally identified by French and Raven (1959) and later modified by Raven (1965, 1992) was used to examine factors related to school psychological consultation. Specifically, this dissertation investigated whether the gender and amount of relevant professional experience of psychologists (i.e., consultants) and teachers (i.e., consultees) influenced how likely psychologists were to use soft power bases when consulting with teachers. In addition, this study examined whether consultants? use of soft power bases was related to their self-evaluations of effectiveness during consultation. Two instruments were employed: the Interpersonal Power Inventory (IPI), which was modified to examine school consultants? likelihood of use of social power bases when consulting with teachers; and the Consultant Evaluation Form (CEF), which was modified to assess psychologists? self-evaluations of effectiveness during teacher consultation. The IPI and CEF were mailed together to 1,000 Nationally Certified School Psychologists, and a total of 352 usable protocols were returned. Results indicated that when consulting with female teachers, female consultants were not more likely to use positive referent power than the other four soft power bases combined; however, male psychologists were more likely to use positive expert power than the other four soft power bases combined. Additional results indicated that consultants? likelihood of use of soft power bases was not related to their years of professional experience, although results of a secondary set of analyses using a slightly different constellation of soft power bases did yield a significant relationship between the two variables. Findings also revealed a significant relationship between consultees? years of experience and consultants? use of soft power bases, in that school consultants were less likely to use soft power with more experienced teachers. Finally, results indicated a significant, positive relationship between consultants? likelihood of use of soft power bases and their self-evaluations of effectiveness during consultation. Findings of this study suggest that the experience level of teachers plays a significant role in determining the influence strategies used by psychologists during consultation. Results also imply that consultants? use of soft power is related to perceptions of more effective school consultation.</field><field name="date">2006-05-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172006-105027/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superoxide Reductase from the Hyperthermophilic Archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus: its Function, Regulation, and Biotechnological Applications</field><field name="creator">Ji, Mikyoung Lee</field><field name="description">The anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furious, possesses a system for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species, which is different from the classical defense mechanisms present in aerobes. P. furiosus employs a novel enzyme system centered on the enzyme superoxide reductase (SOR), which reduces superoxide molecules to hydrogen peroxide without producing oxygen. Surprisingly, P. furiosus SOR, unlike many P. furiosus enzymes, was shown to function at low temperature (&lt;25o C). A model for superoxide reduction by SOR was proposed where the electrons used by SOR to reduce superoxide are supplied by a small iron containing protein, rubredoxin (Rd), and Rd is reduced by the oxidoreductase, NAD(P)H-rubredoxin oxidoreductase (NROR). The first objective of this study was to evaluate the validity of the proposed superoxide reduction pathway by using the recombinant SOR, Rd and NROR enzymes in an in vitro assay as well as to demonstrate in vivo function via complementation studies in superoxide detoxification deficient Escherichia coli strains. The second objective was to investigate the transcriptional expression levels of genes that are involved in the SOR-centered superoxide reduction pathway in order to determine how these genes are expressed and regulated in response to various oxidative stresses. The third objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the biotechnological application of this superoxide detoxification system by expressing SOR in plant cells, which enhanced their survival at high temperature and from drought indicating that it functions successfully in vivo. The fourth objective of this study was the characterization of glutathione reductase (GR) from a psychrophile, Colwellia psychrerythraea, which is stable at low temperatures and protects cells from free radicals by serving as a reductant. The C. psychrerythraea GR gene was cloned into an E. coli-based recombinant expression system. Recombinant C. psychrerythrae GR was expressed and purified. The recombinant GR showed significant activity at low temperature (4&#61616;C). The P. furiosus superoxide reduction system genes and GR from C. psychrerythraea can be engineered into plants (Arabidopsis) to aid in combating damage caused by oxidative stress when plants undergo rapid changes in temperature, high light or UV exposure, or drought conditions.</field><field name="date">2007-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04172007-095920/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of Genetic Parameters for Boar Semen Traits</field><field name="creator">Oh, Sang Hyon</field><field name="description">During the last half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the world pork industry has achieved astonishing developments in pig breeding. Now swine farms are larger, ownership more concentrated, and farms have become more industrialized. Artificial insemination (AI) plays an important role in animal breeding increasing utilization of genetically superior sires. Currently boars selected for commercial use as AI sires are evaluated on grow-finish performance and carcass characteristics. The objectives of this study were to (A) estimate genetic correlations between production and semen traits in the boar; average daily gain (ADG), back fat thickness (BF) and muscle depth (MD) as production traits, and total sperm cells (TSC), total concentration (TC), volume collected (SV), number of extended doses (ND), and acceptance rate of ejaculates (AR) as semen traits; (B) to model the variances and covariances of total sperm cells (&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) over the active lifetime of AI boars; and (C) to compare multiple traits and random regression analyses applied to total sperm cells (TSC). Average heritability estimates were 0.39 for ADG, 0.32 for BF, 0.15 for MD, and repeatability estimates were 0.38 for SV, 0.37 for TSC, 0.09 for TC, 0.39 for ND, and 0.16 for AR. Semen traits showed negative genetic correlations with MD. Genetic correlations would indicate that current selection objectives are having a negative effect on semen traits. Therefore, current AI boar selection practices may be having a detrimental effect on semen production. In random regression analysis for total sperm cells, maximum log likelihood value was observed for sixth, fifth, and seventh order polynomials for fixed, additive genetic and permanent environmental effects, respectively. Best fit as determined by Akaike's Information Criterion was based on a model with sixth, fourth, and seventh order polynomials for fixed, additive genetic and permanent environmental effects, respectively. Best fit as determined by Schwarz Criterion was by fitting fourth, second, and seventh order polynomials for fixed, additive genetic and permanent environmental effects, respectively. Heritability estimates for total sperm cells ranged from 0.27 to 0.61 across age of boar classifications. Heritability for total sperm cells tended to increase with age of boar classification. The cyclic nature of heritability for total sperm cells that was observed over the active lifetime of boars may be due in part to number of observations across seasons limiting our ability to correct for seasonal effects on sperm production. In MTDFREML analysis, heritability estimates of 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, and 27 months of age were, respectively, 0.28, 0.29, 0.26, 0.27, 0.30, 0.79, and 0.41. The results from MTDFREML seemed to be overestimated when compared to random regression. Therefore, random regression methods are the most appropriate to analyze semen traits as they are longitudinal data measured over the boars lifetime.</field><field name="date">2003-04-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04182003-114352/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Flame Stability In The Hysteresis Regime In Co-Flow</field><field name="creator">Terry, Stephen D</field><field name="description">This study documents experiments performed on lifted turbulent diffusion flames in the hysteresis regime with air co-flow. Undiluted methane, ethylene, and propane were used as fuels and two nozzle sizes were used. The results confirm the non-linearity of the lift-off height with nozzle velocity, showing a previously undocumented region where lifted flame height increases as fuel velocity is decreased and that reattachment nozzle velocity varies linearly with co-flow. Using jet relations from Tieszen, the local excess jet velocity was computed and found to vary linearly for flames lifted well above the nozzle. The effect of co-flow was captured using an effective local excess jet velocity, similar to the effective nozzle jet velocity proposed by Montgomery used in conjunction with the results of Khalghatgi. Local excess jet velocities at the reattachment point were also compared for varying co-flow and found to be consistent between co-flow cases. This threshold velocity was found to vary with the inverse of the laminar burning velocity of the fuel squared. Relations for reattachment nozzle velocity and flame lift-off height at reattachment were also determined. The results extend the work of Khalghatgi into the hysteresis regime and complement the work of Gollahalli in determining the mechanisms that support flame stability in the hysteresis regime. Any comprehensive theory for flame stability will have to explain some of the unexpected results seen in the hysteresis regime and incorporate the findings of this study.</field><field name="date">2005-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04182005-093850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Minimal Surface Perturbation Method for Global Surface Registration of Unstructured Point Cloud Data.</field><field name="creator">Aman, Ronald L</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a minimal surface perturbation method for the surface registration of unstructured point cloud data. The registration problem is applicable to many disciplines. Computer vision (stereo vision), computer graphics, image processing, and reverse engineering and quality inspection are examples of areas currently implementing surface registration techniques. The surface registration problem is defined as: Given the unstructured point cloud data sets, find the rotation and translation of one data set such that the two sets are properly aligned in a single coordinate frame. Current techniques fail to find global alignment in instances where the initial starting points are not favorable. In this paper, the proposed method generates a ?geometric handler? to approximate the unstructured data sets using a small number of points capturing the global shape of the data while reducing local variations or features. An iterative searching method is proposed to minimize both the surface perturbation of point cloud data and the orientation variation by using a self-organizing neural network. The transformation of the geometric handlers is found using orientation invariant methods and is applied to the original point cloud. Once the global registration is accomplished, a local registration method is invoked requiring a search in local neighborhoods only. The proposed method can be used for the global surface registration of overlapped unstructured point cloud data sets. The presented techniques can be used in reverse engineering and CAD/CAM systems for product development and surface generation from scanned data.</field><field name="date">2004-04-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04192004-145303/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Canine Babesiosis: Epidemiological, Molecular and Therapeutic Investigations</field><field name="creator">Birkenheuer, Adam Joseph</field><field name="description">Canine babesiosis is an emerging infectious disease in the United States (US). An epidemic of Babesia gibsoni infections in the US was identified. An association between dog breed and B. gibsoni infections was detected. Babesia gibsoni-infected dogs were more likely to be American pit bull terriers and B. canis vogeli infected dogs were more likely to be greyhounds. An association between a recent dog bite and B. gibsoni infection was detected, implicating direct dog-to-dog transmission as a route of infection in the US. Several genes from canine Babesia spp. were characterized, including 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS), cytochrome B (cytB), and rhoptry-associated protein-1 (RAP-1). These genetic data were used to develop a sensitive and specific diagnostic semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for canine babesiosis. Using this assay, a novel large Babesia organism was identified in a blood sample obtained from a clinical patient. Molecular and phylogenetic characterization of this large Babesia spp. determined that it was most closely related to B. bigemina. Lastly, an atovaquone and azithromycin drug combination was shown to be the first treatment to clear canine B. gibsoni infections.</field><field name="date">2004-04-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04192004-164025/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaporative Etching for Non-Contact Glass Scribing using a Single-Mode Ytterbium Fiber Laser</field><field name="creator">Riley, Bradley Elkins</field><field name="description">Laser glass cutting is a process which involves using a laser to either scribe or completely cut glass in place of using a mechanical cutter. The concept of using a laser to cut glass has been established for quite some time however, it wasn?t sought after for industrial application until just recently. With the increase in demand for flat screen televisions, PDA?s, MP3 players and the like, so increased the demand for an efficient non-contact glass cutting method. The two most common types of laser glass cutting processes are short pulsed ablation and thermal shock. While each of these techniques has its own advantages, they have yet to be a complete solution to the demand. Short pulsed ablation tends to create a rough, jagged edge not unlike the defects created by the conventional mechanical glass cutting methods. Thermal shock has successfully separated glass, however, this process requires a trigger crack for glass separation, and as such, the process is unable to perform small precise cuts. A relatively new laser glass processing technique has been established, where, a pulsed laser is used to effectively ablate the surface of glass by focusing through the glass substrate and onto the surface of either silver or copper. As the laser collides with the surface of the metal it vaporizes a small portion of the material, the vapor and plasma particles are sent at high speed toward the lower surface of glass, where it creates a mark in the surface. While this process has successfully marked the surface of glass, attempts at through ablation resulted in damage to the glass surface due to a high absorption after the first few pulses. This paper presents the fundamental application of LIPAA through the use of a low power, continuous wave laser. During the process, a continuous wave laser vaporizes a portion of the aluminum, where, the vapor is then used to thermally etch a scribe in the surface of glass. This new form of scribe generation has the potential to separate glass with little to no defects, thereby, reducing wasted material and strengthening the glass edge.</field><field name="date">2007-08-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04192007-093539/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wrinkle Recovery for Cellulosic Fabric by Means of Ionic Crosslinking</field><field name="creator">Bilgen, Mustafa</field><field name="description">When treated with formaldehyde-based crosslinkers, cellulosic fabrics show improved mechanical stability, wrinkle recovery angles and durable press performance, but N-methylol treatment also causes fabrics to lose strength and later to release formaldehyde, a known human carcinogen.

In fact, from the time she was a teenager until the day she died, Barrett Browning consistently demonstrates through her poetry that she was largely skeptical, if not cynical, about the idea of marriage as it was commonly practiced in Victorian-era England. In a majority of her poems, Barrett Browning depicts wives or brides-to-be as plighted victims or doomed slaves, and harshly characterizes husbands and grooms as dull, unsympathetic philanderers. In poems such as ?A Romance of the Ganges? and ?The Romaunt of the Page,? the balance of power within marriage is consistent with Victorian ideals, since the wives are subservient to their husbands. These husbands are tyrannical figures, and the unreasonable demands they place on their wives ultimately lead to tragic consequences. When Barrett Browning does portray a ?successful marriage? in her poetry, such as that between Aurora and Romney at the end of Aurora Leigh, or between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in ?Crowned and Wedded,? the traditional gender roles of the time have been reversed: the woman is in a position of uncontested authority over the man. This inversion of what constitutes a happy union was fairly radical for the time, but it remains a consistent theme throughout Barrett Browning?s work, challenging Victorian society to reconsider the merits of the popular marital ideal.</field><field name="date">2006-05-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04202006-234749/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Carnivalesque Laughter of Flannery O?Connor</field><field name="creator">Cook, Jonathan Neil</field><field name="description">Critics often point out the incongruity between Flannery O?Connor?s grotesque humor and her self-proclaimed Christian purpose. This paper uses Mikhail Bakhtin?s conception of the carnivalesque to argue that O?Connor?s use of grotesque humor is essential to her purpose. Both O?Connor and Bakhtin distrust all-encompassing ideologies that claim to authoritatively categorize and explain existence. In the carnivalesque laughter created by the grotesque realism of Rabelais, Bakhtin finds a way to undermine worldviews that claim ultimate authority. Similarly, O?Connor uses concrete and grotesque, but humorous images to displace her readers? expectations and undermine their natural desire to explain existence at the expense of mystery. By opening her readers up to mystery, O?Connor prepares them to see the world, and the people in it, as they truly are: complex, flawed, and beautiful.</field><field name="date">2006-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04212006-002139/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBON EXPOSURE ON THREE LIFE STAGES OF FRESHWATER MUSSELS (BIVALVIA: UNIONIDAE)</field><field name="creator">Humphries, LeRoy F</field><field name="description">Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae) are among the most threatened aquatic species in the world. One of the major issues implicated in this decline is water pollution. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a suite of hydrophobic environmental pollutants common in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These compounds are largely derived from petroleum related sources (e.g., gasoline, oil) and are of major concern from transportation-related runoff to aquatic systems due to the acute and chronic (e.g., mutagenic and carcinogenic) toxic properties of many members of this class. The effects of exposure to PAHs have been investigated in many species of bivalves; however, to date no comprehensive study of the effects of exposure to these compounds on all life stages of native freshwater mussels have been completed. The goals of this study therefore were to investigate the effects of exposure to PAHs on all life stages of freshwater mussels and to develop diagnostic tests that are rapid, accurate, inexpensive, and of minimal impact to the mussels. This study examined the acute (48 h) toxicity of PAHs to the glochidial (larval) and juvenile stages of mussels and the sub-acute (7 d) toxic effects on adult mussels. Additionally, the study examined the use of genetic damage as a biomarker of exposure of mussels to PAHs by utilizing the Comet assay to determine levels of DNA strand breakage following aqueous exposure. Finally, mussels were collected from areas of high and low environmental levels of PAHs and were analyzed to validate laboratory findings and to examine relations to previously obtained field PAH mussel, water and sediment measurements. We found that there were no acute toxic effects of PAHs on glochidia or juveniles of the two species of freshwater mussels examined, up to concentrations approaching water solubility, and well exceeding those commonly measured in the streams of North Carolina. Experiments with adult Elliptio complanata, both in the laboratory and from the field, indicated that genetic damage due to PAH exposure was likely present, however the results were highly variable and the potential for biological, ecological, and toxicological consequences were uncertain. Further development and improvement of assay methods may reduce this variation. Generally, mussels from streams with higher average daily traffic counts (ADTC) exhibited greater levels of genetic damage compared to mussels from streams with lower ADTC values. Data obtained from the laboratory study generally showed increasing DNA damage relative to increasing PAH concentration. Based on the data generated, however, PAHs are not likely contributing to acute toxicity of mussels in North Carolina streams, but the chronic, long-term pervasive effect of PAHs on native freshwater mussels remains uncertain.</field><field name="date">2006-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04212006-181938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morley, Morla, M and Other Small Wonders</field><field name="creator">Villers, Jodi Lynn</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of sixty-nine short-shorts and one novella written during my time in the MFA program at North Carolina State University.</field><field name="date">2007-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04212007-145315/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and Experimental Spectroscopic studies of Conducting Metal Oxide Thin Films</field><field name="creator">Efremenko, Alina Yurievna</field><field name="description">In order to expand on the growing field on Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPRS) the application of SPRS to Conducting Metal Oxides (CMO) was studied.

Donald</field><field name="description">Machine tool chatter imposes limitations on the productivity and quality of modern high speed machining (HSM) operations. It has been shown that chatter prediction and avoidance strategies can lead to increased machining productivity if certain modal characteristics of the machine are known. The objectives of this research are to design and demonstrate an electromechanical actuator (EMA) to easily and accurately identify these characteristics. Design specifications for this actuator reflect a wide range of machine tools and operating conditions. A simulation-based design strategy is employed, based on traditional electromechanical analysis, finite element analysis (FEA), and computer simulations to ensure performance meets the design specifications. A prototype EMA system is built to validate the analytical results and demonstrate its capabilities as part of an automated chatter prediction and avoidance system. The EMA is shown to generate the required modal characteristics, namely frequency response functions (FRFs) and stability lobe diagrams (SLDs) quickly, accurately, and with fewer technical skill requirements than other vibration testing methods. Experimental machining tests demonstrate that the EMA can be an effective component of an integrated chatter prediction and avoidance system.</field><field name="date">2002-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04222002-234733/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonstationary Erlang Loss Queues and Networks</field><field name="creator">Alnowibet, Khalid Abdulaziz</field><field name="description">The nonstationary Erlang loss model is a queueing system consisting of a finite number of servers and no waiting room with a nonstationary arrival process or a time-dependent service rate. The Erlang loss model is commonly used to model and evaluate many communication systems. Often, these types of service systems encounter a change in the arrival rate over time while the service rate remains either constant or changes very little over time. In view of this, the focus in this research is the nonstationary Erlang loss queues and network with time-dependent arrival rate and constant service rate. We developed an iterative scheme referred to as the fixed point approximation (FPA) in order to obtain the time-dependent blocking probability and other measures for a single-class nonstationary Erlang loss queue and a nonstationary multi-rate Erlang loss queue. The FPA method was compared against exact numerical results, and two other methods, namely, MOL and PSA, for various nonstationary Erlang loss queues with sinusoidal arrival rates. Although we used sinusoidal functions to model the time-dependent arrival rate, the solution can be obtained for any arrival rate function. Experimental results demonstrate that the FPA algorithm provides an exact solution for nonstationary Erlang loss queue. The FPA algorithm was also applied to the case of multi-rate nonstationary Erlang loss queues and the results obtained were compared with simulation. We generalized the FPA algorithm for networks of nonstationary Erlang loss queues with Markovian branching, and compared its accuracy to simulation. Finally, FPA was used to analyze networks of nonstationary Erlang loss queues with population constraints. Numerical results showed that FPA provides a good approximation.</field><field name="date">2004-04-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04222004-192735/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">?Reciprocity is everything?: The Female Journey to Elective Bonding in African-American Literature</field><field name="creator">O'Neil, Justine Eileen</field><field name="description">This thesis identifies the severe impact of compulsory heterosexuality in the African-American community. In particular, I explore the ways in which compulsory heterosexuality is tied to the legacy of slavery and how it damages Black female subjectivity as well as Black love relationships. I focus on three novels by African-American women ? Gayl Jones?s Corregidora (1975), Opal Palmer Adisa?s It Begins with Tears (1997) and Pearl Cleage?s What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day (1997) ? to illustrate the struggle that Black women face when subjected to sexual and emotional restrictions. I submit that the opposition to compulsory heterosexuality is elective bonding, in which women demand agency in all relationships. Chapter one discusses the authors? portrayals of how compulsory heterosexuality causes a repression of female desire, particularly when women structure their sexual lives around male satisfaction and reproduction. Chapter two focuses on the power of compulsory heterosexuality to obstruct female bonding from women?s lives, mainly by promoting female competition for the male gaze. Finally, chapter three outlines the steps necessary to escape the limitations of compulsory heterosexuality and to enter into elective bonding. My research suggests that effective elective bonding depends largely on building female community. Elective bonding ultimately prepares women to be active agents in all relationships, particularly those with men, in which they denounce compulsory heterosexuality and demand reciprocity. In this project, I posit that female bonding is the medium through which women can escape the sexual and emotional limitations of compulsory heterosexuality.</field><field name="date">2006-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04222006-172341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Second Coming of the Second Tetralogy: Shakespeare?s Depiction of that ?Which is, and Which was, and Which is to come?</field><field name="creator">Price, Trudy Jones</field><field name="description">Shakespeare?s second tetralogy is framed by various biblical types, images and allusions in order to dramatize a specific period in history in terms of divine history. Shakespeare develops the tetralogy?s structure using the structure of the Bible, beginning with an image of Genesis and ending with an image of Revelation. The first play, The Tragedy of Richard II, portrays England as a fallen ?demi-paradise,? reminiscent of Eden, and Richard as a fallen man, a type of Adam whose tragic fall creates the need for a redeemer of England, as reccounted in the providential history of Genesis. This redeemer comes to life in his next two plays, The History of King Henry IV, Parts 1 &amp; 2 in the character of Prince Hal, who is depicted later to be ?the mirror of all Christian princes.? Henry IV, Part I dramatizes Hal?s gradual ?revelation? as that ?redeemer? and also introduces Apocalyptic images in order to foreshadow the hardships portrayed in the next two plays. Henry IV, Part 2 ?mocks [our] expectations? raised by Hal?s success as one who will ?Redeem?time? by allowing the play to linger on as we wait for Henry IV?s imminent death. The tetralogy presents the Fall of man and need for a redeemer, the waiting time (chronos) that must be endured, and the season and fulfillment of that time (kairos) in order to show the audience how to seize their own kairos and live a life worthy of imitation, as Henry V did. An analogical reading of Henry V thus shows Henry to be a character created not to represent Christ, but to remind the audience that Christ is on His way and to provide them with a mirror of how to live according to His word, specifically as revealed in Revelation.</field><field name="date">2006-04-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04222006-173421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adsorpton and Activity of Cellulase Enzymes on Various of Cellulose Substrates</field><field name="creator">Hu, Gang</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to understand the interfacial behavior of cellulase enzymes and its effect on cellulose hydrolysis. This research began with an in-situ monitoring of cellulose hydrolysis using a piezoelectric based quartz crystal microbalance. The time-course kinetics was modeled using a dose response model. The adsorption indicated by the frequency drop followed a Langmuir model as cellulase enzyme increased. Another important part of this research is the development of a new cellulase activity assay based on the piezoelectric technique. This assay provides an easier and more user friendly method for cellulase enzyme activity measurement. It also helps to clarify an element of the interpretation of frequency drops after the injection of cellulase solutions in the hydrolysis of cellulose film, which has been neglected in previous research. Interfacial adsorption of cellulase protein was also investigated using the depletion method. The effects of substrate properties, primarily the crystallinity, which was characterized using X-ray diffraction, were investigated. The effect of surface area, which was measured using both laser light scattering and BET adsorption, on cellulase adsorption were also investigated. It was found that crystallinity played a more important role in cellulase adsorption than surface areas of cellulosic substrate. In characterization of cellulosic substrates, the water retention value (WRV) was also investigated. The results indicated that lower crystallintiy substrates have higher water retention ability. The cellulase adsorption, as well as desorption, was also studied by using sodium dodecyle sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The adsorption results followed the same trend as indicated by the depletion methods. The various isozymes demonstrated a uniform adsorption in proportion to their concentrations. Desorption appeared uniform. Higher pH was found to create higher desorption for a particular cellulase from a particular substrates. It was also found that cellulase from Trichoderma reesei had higher affinity to cellulosic substrates used in this work than the one from Aspergillus niger.</field><field name="date">2009-08-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04222009-234535/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE SIMULATION AND APPROXIMATION OF THE FIRST PASSAGE TIME OF THE ORNSTEIN--UHLENBECK PROCESS OF NEURON</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Liqiu</field><field name="description">Neurons communicate with each other via sequences of action potentials. The purpose of this study is to approximate the interval between action potentials which is also called the First Passage Time (FPT), the first time the membrane voltage passes a threshold. The subthreshold depolarization of a neuron receiving a multitude of random synaptic inputs has often been modelled as the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) process. This model provides an analytically tractable formalism of neuronal membrane voltage mean and variance in terms of a neuron's membrane time constant and the mean of input voltage. Some authors obtained an approximate mean and variance of the FPT for Stein's model with a constant threshold for firing by using Stein's method. They approximated the mean and variance of FPT by using the first term of the Taylor's series expansion. We expect this procedure works for the OU process, a diffusion process. This study finds that Stein's method works well for the OU process with the small Wiener process parameter. After adding a few other terms of the Taylor's series, the parameter range in which the approximation works well are almost the same as the range in which the first term does. The relationship between the approximation results and the confidence band of the mean and variance of the simulated FPT gives evidence that their parameter range is the same; but, the approximation by two terms of the Taylor's series gives less approximation error. The goodness--of--fit--test shows that the lognormal distribution is close to the distribution of FPT for all the Wiener parameters we used. We compared a lognormal distribution of the FPT, estimated from simulation of the OU process, with the probability density function (pdf) of the FPT, approximated from a transformation of the marginal distribution of membrane voltage at the time at which the mean of membrane voltage passes the threshold. We found that the approximation pdf and the lognormal pdf are almost equally close to the true and unknown pdf when the parameter of the Wiener process is small.</field><field name="date">2002-05-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04232002-224527/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Humane Society: A Fable</field><field name="creator">Carter, David Lee Polycarp</field><field name="description">"The Humane Society: A Fable" Is the fanciful existential saga of a chicken named Charlie who is taught to read by an idealistic young woman named Niniane, an ardent vegan and animal rights advocate.

Reactions between dielectric/substrate and gate electrode/dielectric during deposition or post-deposition processing lead to an increase in interfacial layer formation, and the mechanisms that control the changes need to be well understood. We investigate yttrium-based and hafnium-based high-k dielectrics and ruthenium-based gate electrodes formed by various processing methods such as physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD) on Si(100). Characterization techniques include IR, XPS, TEM, EELS, AES, and IV and CV electrical analysis. During deposition and post-deposition treatments the interfaces have some extent of interfacial layer formation. The extent of the intermixing depends on substrate surface preparation, process conditions, and annealing conditions. The transition metal alluminate dielectrics show evidence on flatband voltage tuning via charge compensation.

The primary defense of loblolly pines against bark beetles is constitutive resin, which provides a physical barrier to beetle colonization. A study has been conducted to determine resin production heritablity in clonal loblolly pines. Samples were taken in the spring and late summer of 2005 and 2006 in Milton, FL and Walterboro, SC. Each site included nine complete random blocks containing improved and unimproved checks and 115 and 149 sampled clones, respectively. Two resin samples were collected at breast height from each tree after resin was allowed to flow for 22 +/- 2 hours. Samples were then dried until a subset reached constant mass and sample mass data were used to determine total resin flow repeatability. Total resin flow was found to be significantly higher in one family than the improved check. Resin production by clonal loblolly pines was found to have moderately high repeatability and low positive correlation with tree volume. Results indicate that clone selection that includes resin production as well as desirable growth characteristics can result in loblolly pines that display decreased susceptibility to the southern pine beetle.</field><field name="date">2007-08-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04232007-082818/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Epoxy-hybrid nano-particle Resins for ambient cure VARTM Processes</field><field name="creator">Caldwell, Mary Kathryn</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the mechanical characterization of fire resistant epoxy-hybrid resin systems suitable for ambient cure VARTM processes.

Neat resin castings were tested in tension to determine the elastic modulus, tensile strength and maximum elongation. From these results, six of the resin systems were further cast in unidirectional glass fiber laminates. Transverse tension and short beam shear testing was performed on all laminates to determine the mechanical properties of the glass/epoxy systems. Two of the epoxy-hybrid resin systems showed promising behaviors, having a higher transverse modulus and ultimate strength than the original benchmark vinyl-ester resin.

The objectives of this work were to: 1) determine whether the modeled predictions were accurate by growing four tree species that represented different plant communities under the modeled hydrologies in the greenhouse, and 2) determine how different tree species adapt to saturated soil conditions. Bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana), pond pine (Pinus serotina), and swamp chestnut oak (Quercus michauxii) were grown in greenhouse experiments under three hydrologic regimes: i) ponded for 100 d, ii) ponded for 15 d, and iii) unsaturated. Loamy sand and sapric materials from a restored Carolina Bay were the substrate materials used to represent mineral and organic soils. Bald cypress (representing Non-riverine Swamp Forest) adapted well to 100 d of ponding by producing lateral roots near the surface, aerenchyma tissue in roots and stem, and increasing P uptake. In organic soils ponded for 100 d, bald cypress had significantly greater height, diameter, and total biomass than all other tree species. Sweet bay (representing Bay Forest) adapted well to 100 d of ponding by producing adventitious roots on the submerged portion of the stem. Pond pine (representing Pond Pine Woodland) was intolerant to 100 d of ponded conditions and 75% of the seedlings died in the ponded experiments. Swamp chestnut oak (representing Non-riverine Wet Hardwood Forest) was intolerant to ponding and all seedlings died in ponded treatments. A rhizotron study was conducted to further observe and quantify biological, morphological, and physiological changes in two wetland tree species with differing tolerances to saturated conditions. Bald cypress and swamp chestnut oak seedlings were grown under ponded and unponded conditions for 106 d in rhizotrons containing the same soils used in the container study. Within 2 wk of ponding, bald cypress (BC) seedlings in both organic and mineral soils began to produce lateral roots within the top 36 cm of soil. The swamp chestnut oak (SCO) seedlings subjected to ponding did not produce many new roots, and root death was observed within 4 wk of flooding. Scanning electron microscopy images of basal stems and roots of BC subjected to saturation showed substantial development of aerenchyma, which may have aided in the overall tolerance of BC to ponded conditions. This study showed BC seedlings developed numerous adaptations to saturated conditions, which allowed them to grow in wet organic soils of the Coastal Plain. Results from the container and rhizotron experiments showed that modeling of the long-term hydrology of natural communities was accurate in predicting the preferred wetness requirements of representative trees in three of the four plant communities evaluated.</field><field name="date">2008-05-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04232008-105353/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus Dynamics from Broiler Breeder Diets in Manure, Soil, and Corn.</field><field name="creator">Casteel, Shaun Nathan</field><field name="description">Studies of broiler breeder diet modifications to reduce phosphorus (P) excretion have evaluated bird performance, but no studies have quantified the effects of P in the manure and the impacts to soil and plant availability once soil-applied. Four diets were formulated by factoring two levels, 0.40 and 0.22% available P (NRC, Low, respectively), with or without phytase during the breeder laying phase (wk 22 to 64). Breeders fed phytase produced manures with 15% lower total P concentration, but did not change manure water-soluble P (WSP). However, P in the breeder manures was &gt; 92% orthophosphate. The incubation of the four unique manures in samples of Portsmouth (Typic Umbraquult) and Wagram (Arenic Kandiudult) series generally did not differ in concentrations of Mehlich-3 P, soil WSP, total inorganic P, and total P. Phosphorus-based applications of breeder manures (NRC, Low) and triple superphosphate (TSP, Ca[H2PO4]2 H2O) were applied to a P-deficient, Portsmouth soil in the greenhouse to determine the response of corn (Zea mays). Corn growth was equal among P sources in the initial study, but it tended to be greater in the soils amended with breeder manures in the residual study due to the P applied and the apparent liming effect of the soil. The NRC and Low breeder manures were applied at 39 kg P ha-1 in 2007 at Salisbury (Typic Rhodudult), Lewiston (Aquic Paleudult), and Plymouth (Typic Umbraquult), which ranged in soil P levels.

Corn growth was equal among soils amended with the breeder manures NRC and Low in all site-years and grain P removal was equal five out of six site-years. Grain production, grain P removal, and applied P recovery were equal among P sources in 2007, but the breeder manure treatments were greater than TSP in 2008.

SKIN COLOR AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AMONG MIDDLE-SCHOOL YOUTH</field><field name="creator">Williams, Zaynah Ayisha</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to examine how dissatisfaction with skin color, as a component of perceived physical attractiveness, is associated with adolescent depression and self-esteem, controlling for skin color, beliefs toward skin color, gender, socioeconomic status, perceived discrimination, and peer and teacher stressors. Using a diverse sample of 388 middle-school students, I employ ordinary least squares regression to test hypotheses about the gender-specific and skin color specific effects of dissatisfaction with skin color on adolescent depression and self-esteem. The results show that dissatisfaction with skin color is positively related to depression and negatively related to self-esteem among adolescents. However, black or brown-skinned African American youth who are dissatisfied with their skin color experience higher levels of depression in comparison to white youth who are dissatisfied with their skin color. Implications of the findings are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006-05-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04242006-094230/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Bench-Scale Sequencing Batch Reactor Swine Waste Treatment Under Continuous and Cyclic Aeration</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Todd Alan</field><field name="description">The objectives of this project were to develop operating conditions for a bench-scale sequencing batch reactor to match the design of a full-scale sequencing batch reactor system for treating swine waste and to determine the effects of continuous, low oxygen versus cyclic aeration schemes on sequencing batch reactor system performance. The low aeration technique was intended to develop conditions for low oxygen nitrification and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification so that a comparison could be made to a typical cyclic aeration reactor for biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal. The performance of the two reactor configurations was measured by the settling efficiency, mass removal efficiency, and accumulation of chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total phosphorus (TP). The performance of the reactors did not meet expectations due to excessive loading and source inconsistency. Operational changes to the solids wasting mechanism and to the cyclic aeration system were made during the experiment in an attempt to stimulate reactor performance, which provided insight into the responses of the two types of reactors to these changes. The performance of the continuous aeration reactors met or exceeded the performance of the cyclic aeration reactors, while receiving a 73% lower supply of oxygen. The results support the potential for equipment and energy savings by utilizing low-oxygen continuous aeration for the treatment of swine waste with sequencing batch reactors.</field><field name="date">2007-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04242007-234951/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Heuristic Approach to a Portfolio Optimization Model with Nonlinear Transaction Costs</field><field name="creator">Na, Sungsoo</field><field name="description">In this thesis we extend the Markowitz Mean-Variance model to a rebalancing portfolio optimization problem incorporating realistic considerations such as transaction costs and a risk-free asset with short-selling allowed, and we apply the Tabu Search (TS) heuristic to solve practical portfolio problems. First of all, we propose a biobjective portfolio optimization model which we expect to yield a portfolio equilibrium by combining the two objectives: maximize the portfolio&#226;s expected return and minimize its risk. For realistic portfolio problems we consider the multi-objective portfolio optimization models incorporating the risk-free asset and its short-selling and nonlinear transaction costs based on a single-period and a rebalancing portfolio optimization problem. Especially, to solve the rebalancing portfolio problem, we develop an adaptive, advanced TS algorithm having an evolutionary neighborhood structure, and we solve the problem with an iterative folding back procedure in the decision tree structure. Computational studies are performed with a risk-free asset and the number of risky assets to be 5, 10, 12, and 15 for both the single-period and rebalancing portfolio problems.</field><field name="date">2008-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04242008-122235/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Min-Cost Multicommodity Network Flows: A Linear Case for the Convergence and Reoptimization of Multiple Single-Commodity Network Flows</field><field name="creator">Kramer, Jeremy Daniel</field><field name="description">Network Flow problems are prevalent in Operations Research, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering and Management Science. They constitute a class of problems that are frequently faced by real world applications, including transportation, telecommunications, production planning, etc. While many problems can be modeled as Network Flows, these problems can quickly become unwieldy in size and difficult to solve. One particularly large instance is the Min-Cost Multicommodity Network Flow problem. Due to the time-sensitive nature of the industry, faster algorithms are always desired: recent advances in decomposition methods may provide a remedy. One area of improvement is the cost reoptimization of the min-cost single commodity network flow subproblems that arise from the decomposition. Since similar single commodity network flow problems are solved, information from the previous solution provides a "warm-start" of the current solution. While certain single commodity network flow algorithms may be faster "from scratch," the goal is to reduce the overall time of computation. Reoptimization is the key to this endeavor. Three single commodity network flow algorithms, namely, cost scaling, network simplex and relaxation, will be examined. They are known to reoptimize well. The overall goal is to analyze the effectiveness of this approach within one particular class of network problems.</field><field name="date">2009-05-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04242009-204158/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural Networks for Pattern Classification and Universal Approximation</field><field name="creator">Liao, Yi</field><field name="description">This dissertation studies neural networks for pattern classification and universal approximation. The objective is to develope a new neural network model for pattern classification, and relax the conditions for Radial-Basis Function networks to be universal approximators. First, the problem of pattern classification is introduced, which is followed by a brief introduction of three popular nonlinear classification techniques, that is, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Radial-Basis Function (RBF) networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Then, based on the basic concepts of MLP, RBF and SVM, a new neural network model with bounded weights is proposed, and some experimental results are reported. Later, the problem of universal approximation by neural networks is introduced, and the researches on ridge activation functions and radial-basis activation functions are reviewed. Then, the relaxed conditions for RBF networks to be universal approximators are presented. We show that RVF networks can uniformly approximate any continuous function on a compact set provided that the radial basis activation function is continuous almost every where, locally essentially bounded, and not a polynomial. Some experimental results are reported to illustrate our findings. The dissertation ends with the conclusion and future research.</field><field name="date">2002-07-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252002-141320/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foraging ecology of the early life stages of four shark species (&lt;i&gt;Rhizoprionodon terraenovae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carcharhinus limbatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carcharhinus isodon&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Carcharhinus brevipinna&lt;/i&gt;) in Apalachicola Bay, Florida.</field><field name="creator">Bethea, Dana Michelle</field><field name="description">As top predators, sharks have an important role in marine ecosystems in relation to populations of fish and invertebrates at lower trophic levels. Fishery management plans stress the need for an ecosystem approach, but few quantitative data on the foraging ecology of sharks have been published. Results from a literature review found that shark species close in taxonomic relation have high diet overlap. Stomach contents and catch data of early life stages of Atlantic sharpnose (&lt;i&gt;Rhizoprionodon terraenovae&lt;/i&gt;), blacktip (&lt;i&gt;Carcharhinus limbatus&lt;/i&gt;), finetooth (&lt;i&gt;Carcharhinus isodon&lt;/i&gt;), and spinner sharks (&lt;i&gt;Carcharhinus brevipinna&lt;/i&gt;) taken from fishery independent surveys in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, April-October 1999-2002 were examined to test for resource competition. All species are capable of taking teleost prey from birth, though Atlantic sharpnose and blacktip sharks show an ontogenetic shift in diet. Young-of-the-year Atlantic Sharpnose sharks feed mainly on shrimp, juveniles on sciaenids, and adults on clupeids. Young-of-the-year blacktip sharks feed mainly on sciaenids, whereas juveniles feed on clupeids. The primary prey of young-of-the-year and juvenile finetooth and spinner sharks is menhaden. Seven of ten size-selectivity tests showed neutral selection. Atlantic sharpnose and finetooth sharks consume relatively small-sized prey (over 60% &lt;20% of their length) compared to teleost piscivores while blacktip sharks consume relatively larger prey (58% &gt;20% of their length). Regardless of maturity state and species, diet overlap is high for species-life stage combinations that are similar in size; however, species-life stages did not show significant overlap in habitat use. One possible interpretation is that prey categories shared by similar-sized species are not limiting, but competition may exist for available habitat resources. More intensive monitoring is needed to fully understand temporal and spatial habitat use patterns among these early life stages. Quantifying the links among these sharks and the links between these sharks and resource species are critical for ecosystem modeling and a key step to a broader approach in fisheries management.</field><field name="date">2003-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252003-160742/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Half-Way House</field><field name="creator">Hennessy, Mark Thomas</field><field name="description">The purpose of my study has been to produce a book of poetry.</field><field name="date">2006-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252006-075117/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How to Take a Punch in the Face</field><field name="creator">Robbins, Penelope Virginia</field><field name="description">This is a collection of stories written in the three years that the author attended graduate school for creative writing at North Carolina State University.</field><field name="date">2006-04-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252006-095109/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of Prostaglandin-Stimulated Recovery of Mucosal Barrier Function in the Ischemia-Injured Porcine Intestine: Role of Intestinal Ion Transport</field><field name="creator">Moeser, Adam James</field><field name="description">A series of experiments were conducted to determine physiologic mechanisms of mucosal repair in the ischemia-injured intestine. The first experiment (Chapter III) investigated the contributory role of individual Cl- channels in the recovery of barrier function in ischemia-injured porcine ileum. Ischemia-injured porcine ileal mucosa was mounted in Ussing chambers. Short circuit current (Isc) and transepithelial resistance (TER) were measured in response to PGE2 and pharmacologic inhibitors of epithelial Cl- channels. Overall, results from these studies demonstrate that ClC-2-mediated intestinal Cl- secretion restores TER in ischemia-injured intestine. Chapter IV entails a study aimed at more directly investigating the role of ClC-2 in mucosal repair by evaluating mucosal repair in ischemia-injured intestinal mucosa mounted on Ussing chambers treated with the selective ClC-2 agonist, lubiprostone. Results from this suggest that activation of ClC-2 with the selective agonist, lubiprostone, stimulated elevations in TER and reduction in mannitol flux in the Ischemia-injured intestine. In Chapter V, experiments focused on the role of individual NHE isoforms in the recovery of barrier function in ischemia-injured porcine ileum.

The performance of the semiconductor is directly related to the uniformity of its composition. The crystal?s composition generally changes due to a changing melt composition with segregation coefficient not equal to unity. Therefore, a major objective during the growth of any semiconductor crystal is to minimize the variations of the crystal?s dopant or alloy composition. Externally-applied fields such as magnetic and electric fields can be used to provide electromagnetic damping or stirring of the melt motion in order to minimize the dopant or alloy segregation in the melt and thus in the crystal. This research focuses on investigations of various semiconductor crystal growth processes from the melt in the presence of externally-applied fields. These processes are (1) the Bridgman-Stockbarger process in steady magnetic fields, (2) the vertical gradient freezing process using submerged heater growth in steady magnetic and electric fields, (3) the Bridgman process using submerged heater growth in a rotating magnetic field, and (4) the Bridgman process using submerged heater growth in a combination of steady and rotating magnetic fields. Numerical models are developed using a Chebyshev spectral method with Gauss-Lobatto collocation points. These models provide predictions of the temperature, velocity and concentration fields in the melt as well as the dopant or alloy concentration in the entire crystal.</field><field name="date">2006-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252006-141628/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant Molecular Evolution</field><field name="creator">Strain, Errol Alan</field><field name="description">The current dissertation looks at the molecular evolution of protein-coding genes in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana and within two RNA viruses, humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Astroviridae. We analyzed members of the receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana for positive selection. Likelihood analysis found evidence for positive selection in 12 of the 52 RLK family sequences groups. These 12 groups represent 97 of the 403 sequences analyzed. The majority of genes in groups subject to positive selection have not been functionally characterized, but sites under selection are predominantly located in the extracellular region. In HIV we use Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) based model averaging for models of nucleotide evolution to examine estimates of genetic distance and the ratio of transition/transversion (ts/tv). AIC weighted estimates of distance and ts/tv were shown to be robust relative to model assumptions. AIC weighted estimates of the ts/tv ratio in simulated HIV sequences generally had less variance than similar estimates made by selecting the single best scoring AIC model. Astroviruses are a leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in infants worldwide and little is known about the mechanisms of astrovirus-induced diarrhea or the virally encoded components responsible for disease. We report the genomic sequence of nine novel TAstV-2 isolates. Nucleotide and amino acid identities for the isolates were generally &gt; 90% conserved. Phylogenies constructed using genomic RNA and the individual open reading frames (ORF) provide evidence for recombination and indicate differences in substitution rates between non-structural and structural genes. Analysis of the viral capsid genes using codon models of evolution indicate site-specific positive selection in both turkey and human astroviruses.</field><field name="date">2006-08-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252006-234357/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation of ionic cellulose for wrinkle resistant fabrics</field><field name="creator">Vargantwar, Pruthesh Hariharrao</field><field name="description">Conventional treatment of cellulosic fabrics by formaldehyde-based cross-linkers provides improved wrinkle recovery angles (WRA) and durable press (DP) performance. But these treatments suffer from strength loss and later release of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Ionic crosslinking offers a potential solution to these problems, and has shown improved wrinkle recovery performance in previous studies. In the current novel method of ionic crosslinking for wrinkle resistant fabrics, the cellulosic fabric is treated with salt of mono chloroacetic acid and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHTAC) sequentially or in mixture to form covalently bonded anionic and cationic sites on cellulose, which are durable to washing, and which form inter/intra molecular ionic cross-links. There is no later release of hazardous chemicals involved with this treatment and improved wet WRA are obtained. Fabric treated by this method gained tensile strength and breaking strain compared to the untreated fabric. Different routes for chloroacetate treatment are presented. Pad-dry-pad-cure is the most efficient route and a functional relationship between the anionic content and the process parameters is established. Analytical techniques like confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are used to confirm the morphological changes and occurrence of carboxymethylation reaction in the fiber interior.</field><field name="date">2007-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252007-154942/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of Mulches and Polyacrylamide for Erosion Control and Vegetative Establishment</field><field name="creator">Babcock, Deanna</field><field name="description">The application of mulch products to disturbed soil is frequently used to decrease soil erosion. The addition of polyacrylamide (PAM) has been demonstrated to reduce erosion even further. We conducted rainfall-simulator and field tests on several types of mulch, hydromulch, and erosion control blankets with varying rates of PAM to determine the relative improvements in erosion control and vegetative establishment achieved by different groundcovers and PAM. We also compared applications of granular (37 and 74 kg ha-1) and aqueous (37 kg ha-1) PAM with straw. The tests were done on 2- x 1-m soil boxes tilted to 32% slope and three field locations with similar slopes. Under simulated rainfall, the addition of 37 kg ha-1 aqueous PAM to any mulch type tended to reduce runoff turbidity, TSS, and sediment loss, with reductions of 50% or more in some cases. In the absence of PAM, increasing hydromulch rate from 1971 kg ha-1 to 2957 kg ha-1 significantly reduced turbidity for an experimental cotton product but not for wood fiber. Granular PAM, when applied at a rate equal to that of aqueous PAM, had a significantly higher mean turbidity and TSS; total sediment loss was reduced by dry-PAM only at the higher rate. The lower rate of granular PAM apparently did not reduce erosion but did flocculate the sediment captured in the runoff collection bucket, reducing turbidity. In field experiments, bonded fiber matrix had significantly lower biomass and vegetative cover than all other treatments at one site but differences were not significant at other sites. In one instance where a cotton fiber matrix test product washed off the slope face, runoff turbidity and TSS was significantly higher than other treatments. There were no instances of straw with PAM significantly improving biomass or vegetative cover compared to straw alone.</field><field name="date">2008-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04252008-143910/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damage Monitoring in Woven Composites Using Fiber-Bragg Grating Sensors on Multiple Time Scales</field><field name="creator">Propst, Adam Christopher</field><field name="description">This study investigates the application of Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) optical sensors interrogation techniques over several time scales to monitor damage in composite structures due to low velocity impacts events.

Impact events are characterized by acceleration and position sensors integral to the impactor head. The embedded FBG sensors are interrogated using three different interrogation techniques. Low speed, full spectrum measurements are recorded using a tunable laser source. High speed, peak wavelength detection data is taken using a commercial peak wavelength interrogation system. Finally, high speed full spectrum measurements are recorded using new instrumentation developed at Brigham Young University.

The main tool used in both is the Fast Marching method, a fast algorithm for solving the eikonal equation. An application using Fast Marching to solve a model for sand pile formation in domains with obstacles is shown. A new, second order Fast Marching scheme for domains with obstacles is introduced.

Currently, little is known of the reproductive biology of this species. Therefore, we sought to describe its flowering phenology, compatibility pattern, and which of its various flower visitors were the more effective pollinators, to inform conservation efforts. In addition, pollinator limitation can reduce seed number and seed quality in small, isolated plant populations. We conducted a study of insect flower visitation and seed production in these populations to test our hypothesis that plants in the small, isolated populations are visited by fewer insect taxa, receive fewer visits, and produce fewer and/or less fit seeds than do plants in the large population. Our data show that average insect visitor species richness was significantly greater in the large population than in small populations and all but one of the small populations had fewer pollinator visits per head during fifteen minute observations than the large population; however, plants in several small populations produced as many or more seeds per head than did plants in the large population. Therefore, our results were not consistent with expectations of pollinator limitation. However, results show that seeds from small populations produce seedlings that are less fit as those from the large population. We conclude that other factors not examined in this study are more threatening to small, isolated coneflower populations than is pollinator limitation.</field><field name="date">2006-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04262006-195943/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RaPTEX: Rapid Prototyping Tool for Embedded Communication Systems</field><field name="creator">Lim, Jun Bum</field><field name="description">Advances in microprocessors, memory, and radio technology have enabled the emergence of embedded systems that rely on communication systems to exchange information and coordinate their activity in spatially distributed applications.

Results also showed that the closer the perceived congruence between employees&#226; ILTs (measuring their ideal leader) and their actual leader, the higher the ratings of charisma for that leader. There was no influence of ILT congruence on leader performance ratings. Some support was found for previous findings that country/location does have an influence on ILT profile, but no support was found for the influence of age, gender, ethnicity, or organizational tenure, suggesting that ILTs may be generalizable across many different populations.

However, beta sheet peptides were recently designed with improved solubility allowing spectroscopic study as models for beta hairpins in larger proteins. The dynamics of cyclic analogs of gramicidin S and two unconstrained beta sheet peptides, H1a and H3, were studied using both a static, temperature-dependent FTIR technique and nanosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. Quench dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to complement the experimental work and to aid in the analysis of two of the cyclic peptides. The folding rates of cyclic peptides are accelerated by at least an order of magnitude over the rates of linear beta hairpin peptides suggesting that nucleation of the folding event is the rate-determining step. The kinetic data for H1a and H3 were analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD). The H1a peptide has two observed relaxation rates corresponding to several hundreds of nanoseconds and a few microseconds while the H3 peptide fit to a two-state model with a microsecond observed lifetime.

A dielectric spectrometer was utilized to quantify the particle/fluid dielectric mismatch of the lead titanate suspensions and the particle/fluid conductivity mismatch of the zeolite suspensions. The rheological properties were examined by conducting a series of systematic analyses without an electric field and then subsequently with the application of dc and ac fields of various frequencies. Optical microscopy of the suspensions without and with an applied electric field has been employed to determine the particle movement and structure within the suspensions. Observations of the lead titanate particles in suspension under an applied electric field elicited the electrophoretic nature of the particles, which moved towards the electrodes instead of forming chains of particles bridging the electrodes. The lead titanate suspensions exhibited either a very small positive ER effect or in some cases a slight negative ER effect, which involves a reduction in the yield stress with applied electric field. This leads us to conclude that the lead titanate/silicone oil suspensions examined in this study are ineffective ER fluid materials. The zeolite/silicone oil suspensions exhibited a positive ER effect.</field><field name="date">2004-05-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272004-151239/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Life Changes that Adult Daughters go through when they Become Primary Caregivers to Parents with Alzheimer's Disease.</field><field name="creator">Thacker, Herminia Soriano</field><field name="description">A case study analysis was used to investigate the changes in the lives of adult daughters when they became primary caregivers to parents with Alzheimer's disease. This research also explored beliefs, feelings, and perceptions of participants about their role. Based on in-depth and face-to-face interviews with 21 adult daughters and two daughters-in-law, this study argues that although intergenerational caregiving is accepted as a part of membership in families, it is also a source of family disharmony and conflicts. Family nursing is considered a burden based on the length of service. The scope of the changes in the lives of adult daughters/caregivers ranges from living arrangements, family relationships, young children, personal affairs, social activities, employment and economics, health of caregiver to religion. Although caring for AD patients is rigorous, highly stressful, and filled with demanding challenges, the findings of this study show that a majority of adult caregivers would do it all over.</field><field name="date">2004-05-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272004-163924/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COMBINED EFFECTS OF DILUTION AND CO-FLOW ON THE STABILITY OF LIFTED NON-PREMIXED GASEOUS FLAMES</field><field name="creator">Wilson, David Andrew</field><field name="description">This research documents experiments and analysis of turbulent, lifted, non-premixed diffusion flames in co-flow and with dilution with implications for the development and operation of biogas-fueled combustors. Fuels used in this study were methane and ethylene. The diluent used was nitrogen. General trends were observed in the liftoff and reattachment behavior as affected by dilution of the fuel stream. Initial liftoff velocity was observed to decrease linearly with dilution, while initial lift height behavior was bimodal. Reattachment conditions were similar in overall behavior to liftoff conditions. Co-flow effects were not included in liftoff and reattachment studies. Combined effects of dilution and co-flow were also studied. Stabilization height compared to radial stabilization was found to be bimodal, with behavior differing in the potential core region compared with the far-field region. Dilution was found to decrease the radial stabilization distance, and co-flow tended to increase the radial stabilization distance. However, both effects were minor. The major results involve heat release effects. For given stabilization heights, stabilization velocity was found to decrease with dilution faster than laminar burning velocity with dilution. Stabilization height was also found to increase rapidly with dilution beyond a certain diluent concentration. Flames were also found to taper inward and become more cylindrical in shape as dilution increases. Implications for several flame stabilization theories are discussed. Future work for confirming the results of this research are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2005-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272005-121850/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth, carcass, and meat quality in lines divergently selected for testosterone production and their crossbred progeny.</field><field name="creator">Bender, Jan-Marie</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to characterize growth, carcass composition, and meat quality in two Duroc lines of pigs divergently selected 10 generations for testosterone production and then maintained by random within line selection. In generation 21 endogenous testosterone production in the high (HTL) and low (LTL) testosterone lines averaged 49.0 ng/ml and 27.8 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. Eight LTL and 10 HTL boars were used to create 29 LTL and 33 HTL litters. These same boars were mated to a line of white composite (WC) females to generate 11 WC by LTL litters (WLT) and 23 WC by HTL litters (WHT). Barrows and gilts were then selected LTL (n = 53), HTL (n = 61), WLT (n = 102), and WHT (n = 101) for testing. Pigs were weighed and scanned using real-time ultrasound 48 h prior to one of two slaughter dates. Data were analyzed with a mixed model including fixed effects of line, mating type, sex, and random effect of sire nested within line. All possible interactions among fixed effects were tested. Growth and carcass traits analyzed included days to 114 kg (D114), average daily gain (ADG), back fat adjusted to 114 kg (BF), loin muscle area adjusted to 114 kg (LMA), and predicted percent lean (PPL). Fat-O-Meater data collected included hot carcass weight (HCW), adjusted fat depth (FDEPTH), adjusted loin depth (LDEPTH) and percent lean (%LEAN). Meat quality traits characterized included marbling score at 24 h post-mortem (MAR), percent lipid (%LIPID), pH, water-holding capacity (DRIP), color score (CS) and Minolta L*, a*, and b*. The HTL had fewer D114 (P &lt; 0.05), greater ADG (P &lt; 0.01), greater BF (P &lt; 0.01) and lower PPL (P &lt; 0.01) than LTL. For crossbred progeny, WHT and WLT did not differ for D114, ADG, or BF. The WLT had larger LEA (P &lt; 0.05) and higher PPL (P &lt; 0.01) than WHT. The WLT had lower LDEPTH (P &lt; 0.05) than LTL and HTL. The LTL and HTL had higher subjective scores for MAR (P &lt; 0.05). Least square means for %LIPID for HTL and LTL were 4.00 and 3.95, respectively. The WHT had higher means for DRIP (P &lt; 0.01), L*, a* and b* (P &lt; 0.05) than WLT, but did not differ for pH or CS measurements. Pigs selected for increased testosterone production grew faster and produced fatter carcasses than pigs selected for decreased testosterone. Because of their high intramuscular fat content and acceptable meat quality, these lines may be useful in developing premium products.</field><field name="date">2005-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272005-125121/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective Tool Use in a Habile Agent</field><field name="creator">Wood, Alexander Burchi</field><field name="description">Tool use is a hallmark of human intelligence, which has not fully been explored in the artificial intelligence research community. Research in cognitive neuroscience on primates suggests that not only do we maintain a mental representation of our body, but the body schema is modified to include a tool during intentional tool use (Iriki et al., 1996). We have developed a habile (tool-using) agent, based on the Sony Aibo platform, that can pick up a stick and use it as a tool to reach objects previously out of its range. The agent uses a recurrent neural network developed by Steink&#252;hler and Cruse (1998) for maintaining an internal body schema used to find appropriate postures for reaching and grasping tools. We argue that analysis of activities of such tool using agents offers an informative way to evaluate intelligence.</field><field name="date">2005-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272005-135341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative study of the breeding systems of Reticulitermes flavipes and Reticulitermes hageni in a North Carolina Coastal Plain site using microsatellite markers and mtDNA sequence data.</field><field name="creator">Dalton, Hope Anne</field><field name="description">The termites (Isoptera) are an important group of eusocial insects whose breeding systems have been relatively poorly studied. In this study, we inferred the breeding systems of two sympatric species of Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) and R. hageni Banks by investigating colony and population genetic structure using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA markers. Termites were collected in natural wood debris along two transects 1 km apart in a forested site in the Coastal Plain of southeastern North Carolina. Collection points within transects were at least 15 m apart (mean = 22.4 m) and each collection point was found to be a separate colony based on microsatellite genotypes. Of the total colonies collected, eight colonies were identified as R. flavipes, 28 were R. hageni and two colonies were identified as R. virginicus. A total of 720 workers from 36 collection points were genotyped at 5-8 microsatellite loci and the mtDNA haplotype was determined for two individuals from each collection point at the cytochrome oxidase II gene. Genetic analysis of family structure and comparisons of F-statistics (FIT, FIC and FCT) and the coefficient of relatedness (r) were compared with computer-simulated values revealing very similar breeding systems between the two species. Analysis using F-statistics compared with computer simulated breeding systems (Thorne et al. 1999 and Bulmer et al. 2001) suggested that nearly 90% of the colonies of both species were simple families headed by inbred monogamous pairs of reproductives while the remaining colonies were extended (inbred) families headed by low numbers of reproductives that were descendants of the founding pair, possibly their direct offspring. There was no evidence of genetic differences between transects based on microsatellite data for R. flavipes (FST = 0.044, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.011 to 0.104) and evidence for a genetic difference between R. hageni transects (FST = 0.070, 95% CI = 0.025 to 0.108). This suggests a lack of budding and that mating flight dispersal is not limited over the study distance. These results indicate that within the study area R. flavipes and R. hageni have very similar breeding systems characterized by monogamous pairs of reproductives headed by slightly inbred reproductives and that few of these live long enough to produce more than a few neotenics. Results using mtDNA sequence data show two clades for each of the two species, R. flavipes and R. hageni. When comparing clades using microsatellite data, no significant difference between the clades was found for R. hageni, but a significant difference was found between clades for R. flavipes.</field><field name="date">2005-04-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272005-145915/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Investigation of Rate-Dependent Inner Hysteresis Loops in PZT</field><field name="creator">York, Alexander</field><field name="description">The rate-dependence of piezoelectric material resulting from the kinetics of domain switching is an important factor that needs to be included in realistic modeling attempts.

Experiments covering full loop as well as first, second, third and forth order reversals are conducted at different loading rates with polarization and strain recorded. Creep behavior at different constant levels of the electric field is also observed. The kinetics are characterized by strongly varying relaxation times that can be associated with different switching mechanisms. Inner hysteresis loops in the (P, E) diagram are also shown to have different characteristics depending on the electric field level at the reversal points.</field><field name="date">2005-04-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272005-162724/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do Technological Changes and Organizational Context Affect Job Autonomy?</field><field name="creator">Choi, Seunghee</field><field name="description">This paper examines when jobs are autonomous in the labor process and under what kinds of circumstances workers achieve more control of their work process. The degree of skill, technology, and bureaucratization are addressed in previous literatures and are analyzed in this paper as sources of variation in work autonomy. The data employed for this study is the 2002 Australian National Organizations Survey, and the research target is core jobs, defined as jobs directly related to the primary product or service of the organizations. Ordinal Logistic regression is employed for this study and result shows that information based technology increase job autonomy for jobs that require higher education. Also, formalized jobs are likely to have less job autonomy. More generally, findings suggest that job autonomy is contingent on relative power in the labor process and that formalization is primarily a control device at least relative to the labor process.</field><field name="date">2005-05-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272005-183941/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Xenopus laevis claudin (Xcla) tight junction genes in development</field><field name="creator">XIE, JIANZHEN</field><field name="description">Eight Xenopus laevis claudin genes, Xcla1, Xcla4B, Xcla5, Xcla6, Xcla12, Xcla16, Xcla18 and Xcla19, were cloned and sequenced.

The protein expression of Xcla5 was detected at the neural stage by whole mount immunostaining. Overexpression of Xcla5 by injection of synthetic mRNA into embryos caused morphological defects similar to those in embryos exposed to Bisphenol A (BPA). Altered patterns of claudin gene expression in the presence of BPA can be correlated with these developmental defects.

Specifically, this study sought to gain a better understanding of the association between parenting and children?s interpretations and mental representation of cues (intent attribution), their ability to generate solutions (response generation), and their solution selection process (response decision) and how these processes, in turn, relate to children?s propensity to behave aggressively. The sample consisted of 166 children and their parents. Approximately half of the children had a substantiated history of physical abuse. It was hypothesized that (a) higher levels of parental harshness would predict higher levels of aggression in children, (b) hostile intent attributions, fewer types of solutions generated, and a higher number of aggressive decisions would predict higher levels of child aggression, and (c) the relationship between parental harshness and aggressive behavior would be mediated by intent attributions, response generation, and response decision. Mediation was assessed using a series of regression analyses. Results revealed that harsh parenting did not significantly predict child aggression, response generation or response decision. Harsh parenting, did however, predict children?s intent attributions. Harsh parenting also predicted response decision when recoded as a dichotomous variable in a post-hoc analysis. Results further revealed that none of the social information processing operations investigated (intent attributions, response generation, and response decision) significantly predicted child aggression. Due to the lack of prediction among variables, mediation could not be assessed. Considerations for interpreting results, as well as directions for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272006-090446/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Investigations Into The Operational Parameters Of a 50 Centimeter Class Pulsejet Engine</field><field name="creator">Ordon, Robert Lewis</field><field name="description">A hobby scale pulsejet, commercially available from Bailey Machine Services (BMS), is significantly instrumented and tested to develop a theoretical understanding of how various inlets, fuel systems, and exhaust sizes effect the overall performance of the jet.

Rectal temperatures and blood samples were obtained from cows every other day throughout the trial. Serum progesterone concentrations were measured with radioimmunoassay (RIA). Pregnancy status was determined on approximately day 30 via transrectal ultrasonography. Mean temperature-humidity index (THI) values were 73.5 for trial 1 and 75.1 for trial 2. These THI values indicated that cows in both trials were subjected to mild heat stress conditions. No significant differences were found between CIDR treated and control cows in serum progesterone concentrations. In trial 1, pregnancy rates were 31.8% vs. 33.3% for control and CIDR treated cows, respectively (p = 0.25).

How to bridge the gap between raw sensorimotor data and symbolic representation in a robotic agent is still an open question. The research described in this document is inspired by theories in cognitive science, such as concept theory and embodied realism, as well as work in robotics and AI. The general goal of this research is to build a system capable of acquiring and maintaining semantic knowledge for higher-level reasoning, in particular reasoning about the use of tools, from the embodied experience of a cognitive agent in a simulated environment or in the real world. This research addresses cognitive theories of embodiment, the design of a general computational architecture, and the design and implementation of AI techniques for solving tool-using problems. One of the major contributions of this research is to provide a computational architecture for an embodied agent that can capture semantic relations from its interactions with the world, sufficient to support effective tool use both in short-term predictions and plan generation. As a result, we have implemented an example of this architecture in an Action Schema Generator, or ASG, which can automatically generate production rules and symbolic representations from a simulated agent&#226;s embodied experience without losing the capability of transferring the knowledge backwards to its original numerical sensorimotor format. We have developed pragmatic methods to evaluate the performance of ASG, at the component level and the system level, in simulated and real scenarios, for tasks with and without tools. We also have compared our design with other robotics and cognitive architectures, including behavior-based robotics, Neuroevolution, and psychologically inspired architectures. We believe that our work can provide a general foundation for embodied agents, and should be useful in future research.</field><field name="date">2009-05-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04272009-112748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure-Property Relationships of Copper(I) Tetrachloroaluminate and Related Compounds.</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Roger Michael</field><field name="description">Copper(I) tetrachloroaluminate, a metal halide analog of the corner-shared tetrahedral aluminophosphate framework materials, is exploited to explore the dynamic physical properties and reactivity of metal halide crystalline lattices. Upon irradiation with UV light, heating, or exposure to small molecule liquids and gases, CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes dynamic physical and chemical changes. The &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;- and &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;-CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; phases show brilliant blue to blue-green luminescence. The electronic structure of the CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; corner shared tetrahedral framework is explored by fluorimetric and diffuse reflectance measurements on the isomorphous series &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;-CuAlBr&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4-x&lt;/sub&gt; (x=0-4). The photoluminescence is demonstrated to be a bulk property of the electronically isolated CuCl&lt;sub&gt;4/2&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra within the framework matrix. The sorption/desorption of small molecule gases further results in the reversible quenching of the photoluminescence. The &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;- and &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;-phases of CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are further characterized by solid-state &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al and &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. The very short spin-lattice relaxation times of the copper spins, and the sensitivity of the I=3/2 &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu nucleus to the small differences in the local structure of Cu in the two phases, allow &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu spectra to be acquired in very short time periods (1 minute), in which the &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;b&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt; phases are clearly resolved. This time resolution is exploited to follow the phase transition from the pseudo-hexagonal close-packed &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;b&lt;/font&gt;-CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into the pseudo-cubic close-packed &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;-CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which occurs above 100 &#186;C. In situ time-resolved &lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;Cu MAS NMR and synchrotron x-ray diffraction experiments were used to measure the kinetics of this phase transition as a function of temperature. The transformation is shown to be a first-order phase transition involving no intermediate phases with an activation energy of 138 kJ/mol. The kinetic data obey a first order Avrami-Erofe'ev rate law. A one-dimensional growth mechanism is proposed that involves a combination of Cu&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="symbol"&gt;+&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ion self-diffusion and a translational reorganization of the close-packed anion layers imposed by the periodic rotations of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="symbol"&gt;-&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tetrahedra. Ethylene reversibly reacts with the solid phases of CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to yield one and two equivalent adduct phases. Upon sorbtion the three dimensional metal halide framework is deconstructed into loosely associated one-dimensional chains, which upon desorbtion reconstruct the three-dimensional &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;-CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; framework. The structures of the adduct phases and reactive pathways that interconvert them are probed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, time-resolved in situ synchrotron powder X-ray, multinuclear solid state NMR spectroscopy, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Three crystalline phases are reported. At ambient temperature, under ethylene pressures below 100 Torr, formation of &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;a&lt;/font&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;b&lt;/font&gt;-(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is favored. When the initial pressure of ethylene is greater than 1 atmosphere, the (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuAlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; phase is observed to form without going through a one equivalent intermediate. The structure reactivity relationship of the ethylene copper aluminum chloride system suggests some general understandings of how the coordination environment of Cu(I) effects its ability to act as &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;s&lt;/font&gt;-acceptor and &lt;font face="symbol"&gt;p&lt;/font&gt;-donor in olefin separations and catalysis.</field><field name="date">2002-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282002-181104/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Recruiters' Perceived Value of Study Abroad and International Travel Experiences.</field><field name="creator">Peacock, Jessica Ivy</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to develop a comprehensive listing of the character traits and personal gains students who participate in study abroad have claimed to acquire from international trips abroad (from secondary data sources) and to determine whether these are congruent with the desires of corporate recruiters and hiring managers.

Undergraduates (N = 249) completed self-report questionnaires regarding conflict strategies witnessed and experienced in the home during their adolescence and regarding the likelihood of using certain conflict resolution strategies with a romantic partner in response to hypothetical vignettes. Results indicated that family violence history did not predict conflict resolution strategies for the full sample. However, for a subsample of participants who had experienced physical aggression in the home, experiencing that aggression predicted later use of hostile strategies with a romantic partner. Witnessing aggression predicted later hostile strategy use for men, but not women. For both the full and subsamples, witnessing and experiencing reasoning in the home predicted later use of prosocial strategies.</field><field name="date">2006-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282006-000023/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived Risk of Victimization: Individual and Contextual Effects Revisited</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, Kristina Jean</field><field name="description">The purpose of the current analysis is to look at both individual and contextual predictors of perceived risk of victimization. Specifically, the present work builds directly on the contributions of Rountree and Land (1996) and goes beyond their work in several ways. The current work includes additional census tract measures and redefines a key concept index. Drawing upon routine activity theory, social disorganization theory, and social disorder theory, the current analysis includes individual, neighborhood, and census tract level predictors of perceived risk. Data collected on neighborhood characteristics and crime rates in Seattle, Washington in 1990 are used. Using a multi-stage sampling design, 5,302 individuals were surveyed. Multinomial logistic regression is used in this analysis. General support is found for routine activity theory, social disorganization theory, and social disorder theory. Most notable, however, support is found for including census tract level measures.

A parameter termed ?hard-to-remove (HR) water content? was defined as the ratio of water mass to fiber mass at the transition between the constant and falling rate drying zones of an isothermal TGA experiment. The HR water content showed a linear relationship with water retention value. TGA and DSC were used to explain the linear relationship. During drying, free water was observed to evaporate first, followed by trapped water, freezing bound water and then non-freezing bound water, with some overlap. Trapped water can be described as water bound to the fibers, but difficult to evaporate. For pilot papermachine samples, all the water in the wet web entering the dryer section was HR water, with no free water detected. Based on the results, a qualitative drying model of cellulose fibers was proposed with regard to decreasing moisture ratio. Changes in the pore size distribution during drying were determined using DSC measurements and the Gibbs-Thomson equation. Larger pores collapsed first followed by the sequential collapse of smaller pores, indicating that pore wall collapse resistance is critical. The average pore size for bleached softwood was calculated to be about 80 nm and decreased with drying. A constant pore size of about 20 nm was observed at moisture ratios below 0.3 g/g, which corresponds to one-to-two layers of non-freezing bound water. The heat of vaporization of water associated with cellulose fibers was determined using modulated DSC and showed a steep increase at moisture ratios below 0.3 g/g, indicating that a higher energy is required to evaporate non-freezing bound water.</field><field name="date">2006-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282006-140641/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of an operon involved in the production of Lactacin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus</field><field name="creator">Dobson, Alleson E</field><field name="description">Lactacin B is a class II bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM (Barefoot and Klaenhammer 1983). Mutational, nucleotide sequence, and transcriptional analyses revealed that the genetic determinants responsible for lactacin B regulation and production are located on a 9.5 kb polycistronic region (LBA1803-LBA1791) of the L. acidophilus NCFM chromosome. The lab operon comprised 12 putative open reading frames (ORFs) organized into three clusters: a production and regulation cluster encoding putative proteins that resemble two component signal transduction systems of the AgrC-AgrA type; an export cluster encoding putative proteins that resemble ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and accessory proteins, and the final cluster composed of three putative proteins of unknown functionality. Each cluster was separated by an intrinsic terminator, the strongest terminators flanked the entire lactacin B region (&#916;G = -13.4kcal/mol and &#916;G = -17.0kcal/mol respectively). A total of 7 genes with unknown functionality were situated in this region, each containing a double-glycine leader motif characteristic of bacteriocin structural genes and their precursors. Insertional inactivation of the gene believed to encode an ABC transporter (labT) completely abolished bacteriocin activity, implicating this region in lactacin B production. Cloning of the first four genes within this region (LBA1803-LBA1800) onto a high copy number plasmid resulted in markedly higher levels of lactacin B activity compared to the control. These ORFs encoded proteins typical to bacteriocin peptides; small, cationic peptides, each with an N-terminal double glycine leader motif. Experiments with chemically synthesized peptides revealed that LBA1800 was not inhibitory, but induced lactacin B production in broth cultures. The genetic organization of the region indicates that lactacin B production is regulated through the three component regulatory system common to many class II bacteriocin systems.</field><field name="date">2006-05-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282006-173216/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL STUDIES ON GREEN STINK BUG, Acrosternum hilare, AND BROWN STINK BUG, Euschistus servus (HEMIPTERA: PENTATOMIDAE), IN EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA CROPPING SYSTEMS</field><field name="creator">Blinka, Eric Lee</field><field name="description">In 2004 through 2007, biological and ecological studies were conducted on the stink bug complex across Eastern North Carolina with emphasis on the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Ecological studies included the use of survey samples, pheromone traps, and black light traps to monitor brown stink and green stink bug, Acrosternum hilare (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), movement across selected Eastern North Carolina agro-ecosystems. Ecological research also focused on the movement of brown stink bugs within a wheat / corn agro-ecosystem through the use of sweep net samples and whole plant examinations, along with the vertical distribution of brown stink bugs on corn plants. Based upon brown stink bugs ability to fully complete the F1 generation within wheat in NC, historical weather data was examined utilizing a sine wave growing degree day model to predict the number of generations possible. The relationship among differing stink bug boll-feeding symptoms (external signs vs. internal symptoms) and boll damage to lint gin-out and quality were also examined. The last ecological study focused on the evaluation of the relationship between stink bug pressure and yield under a regressive spray treatment. A molecular study was conducted to help validate brown stink bug movement between crops by separating proteins of crop host from insect guts utilizing gel electrophoresis and mass finger printing the peptides. The peptides were then searched against the Viridiplantea data base for conformation which crop host proteins were derived from. Results from this work have given some insight to the biological and ecological movement of stink bugs across Eastern North Carolina. It has also demonstrated that there is a need for further investigation into the stink bug complex.</field><field name="date">2008-08-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282008-114706/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast FSR Methods for Second-Order Linear Regression Models</field><field name="creator">Crews, Hugh Bates</field><field name="description">Many variable selection techniques have been developed that focus on first-order linear regression models. In some applications, such as modeling response surfaces, fitting second-order terms can improve predictive accuracy. However, the number of spurious interactions can be large leading to poor results with many methods. We focus on forward selection, describing algorithms that use the natural hierarchy existing in second-order linear regression models to limit spurious interactions. We then develop stopping rules by extending False Selection Rate methodology to these algorithms. In addition, we describe alternative estimation methods for fitting regression models including the LASSO, CART, and MARS. We also propose a general method for controlling multiple-group false selection rates, which we apply to second-order linear regression models. By estimating a separate entry level for first-order and second-order terms, we obtain equal contributions to the false selection rate from each group. We compare the methods via Monte Carlo simulation and apply them to optimizing response surface experimental designs.</field><field name="date">2008-05-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282008-151809/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Reliability and Validity of the WISC-IV with Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Children</field><field name="creator">Krouse, Hailey Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The present study examined the reliability and validity of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children&#226;Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) for use with Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (D/HOH) children.

Results revealed that 8 of the 10 WISC-IV subtests/composites assessed were significantly more reliable (p &lt; .05) compared to the split-half internal consistency reliabilities reported in the WISC-IV Technical and Interpretive Manual (2003) for the normative sample. In addition, the mean Perceptual Reasoning Index (M = 93.21) and Verbal Comprehension Index (M = 80.86) for this sample were significantly lower (p &lt; .001) than the population mean (M = 100). Although the mean Verbal Comprehension Index was not significantly lower than one standard deviation from the mean (M = 85) Interrelationships among the WISC-IV subtests for this sample were assessed through Pearson Product Moment correlations. Of the 44 correlations, 29 were significantly greater than zero (i.e., the 95% confidence interval did not contain zero). Overall, the results support the reliability of the WISC-IV for D/HOH children. However, the evidence for the validity of the WISC-IV with D/HOH children is inconclusive.

Natural longleaf pine ecosystems range from xeric uplands to poorly-drained flatwoods and savannas. Most existing stands, however, occur on xeric to dry-mesic sites and approaches to restoring longleaf pine to wetter sites traditionally utilize intensive practices. There is little information available on the efficacy of these practices to establish longleaf pine seedlings on poorly-drained sites and their impacts on soil properties, seedling survival and growth, and the understory plant community. A research project was established at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC to evaluate the effects of site preparation methods for returning longleaf pine on hydric soils with no natural seed source. Various site preparation treatments were evaluated in a field experiment, and results revealed greater growth and earlier emergence from the grass stage with more intensive site preparation. There was a marginal increase in soil nutrients, and a slight increase in foliar nutrients found with the more intensive treatments. Site preparation influenced seedling growth in the short-term and this was likely due to the cumulative effects of controlling competition and modifying the planting site. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and other Department of Defense installations include both former and remnant longleaf pine ecosystems that support federally protected plants and animals such as the red-cockaded woodpecker - and thus face the challenge of restoring former, poorly-drained longleaf pine ecosystems. A land use history revealed that, largely due to its poorly-drained status and inaccessibility, the majority of disturbance on the research area occurred after the 1920&#226;s and was largely due to forestry activities. Since purchasing the land area of the project in 1996, the Marine Corps&#226; challenge has been to balance the mission of training and readiness with the need for restoration and long-term management of longleaf pine ecosystems. The results of this work provide natural resource managers with a scientific foundation for assessing choices to assist in this restoration and management effort.</field><field name="date">2008-06-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282008-191226/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavior of Infill Masonry Walls Strengthened with FRP Materials</field><field name="creator">Lunn, Dillon Stewart</field><field name="description">Collapse of unreinforced masonry (URM) structures, including infill walls, is a leading cause of property damage and loss of life during extreme loading events. Many existing structures are in need of retrofit to bring them in compliance with modern design code provisions. Conventional strengthening techniques are often time-consuming, costly, and add significant weight to the structure. These limitations have driven the development of alternatives such as externally bonded (EB) glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) strengthening systems, which are not only lightweight, but can be rapidly applied and do not require prolonged evacuation of the structure. The objective of this research program was to evaluate the effectiveness of strengthening infill masonry walls with externally bonded GFRP sheets to increase their out-of-plane resistance to loading. The experimental program comprises fourteen full-scale specimens, including four un-strengthened (control) specimens and ten strengthened specimens. All specimens consisted of a reinforced concrete (RC) frame (which simulates the supporting RC elements of a building superstructure) that was in-filled with solid concrete brick masonry. The specimens were loaded by out-of-plane uniformly distributed pressure in cycles up to failure. Parameters investigated include the aspect ratio, the strengthening ratio, the number of wythes, and the type of FRP anchorage used. The type of FRP anchorage was found to greatly influence the failure mode. Un-strengthened specimens failed in flexure. However, strengthened specimens without overlap of the FRP onto the RC frame failed due to sliding shear along the bed joints which allowed the walls to push out from the RC frames in a rigid body fashion. In the case where GFRP sheets were overlapped onto the RC frames, the aforementioned sliding shear caused delamination of the GFRP sheets from the RC frames. Use of steel angles anchored along the perimeter of the walls as shear restraints allowed these walls to achieve three times the service load without any visible signs of distress. GFRP strengthening of infill masonry walls was found to be effective, provided that proper anchorage of the FRP laminate was assured.</field><field name="date">2009-05-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282009-143603/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of black shank resistance management on the population biology of Phytophthora nicotianae in tobacco</field><field name="creator">Gallup, Courtney Anne</field><field name="description">Black shank of tobacco, caused by the oomycete Phytophthora nicotianae, is an important disease of tobacco. Emergence of race 1 has led to loss of major gene resistance and to questions on the genetic diversity in the pathogen in North Carolina. Race 3 is reported for the first time in NC. Race 3 is virulent on plants with the Phl gene and not the Php gene and causes severe disease symptoms on mature plants. Isolates of race 3 were recovered from locations where the Phl gene was deployed and in fields characterized as the wild-type race, race 0, with no history of single-gene resistance. In order to determine whether races 1 and 3 can develop as natural variants from race 0, and to track loss of Php and Phl virulence in races 1 and race 3, soil was infested with one race of P. nicotianae and planted with tobacco varieties with multigenic resistance. Isolates were recovered after five months and screened for race. Additionally, zoospore isolates were derived from progenitor zoospore isolates representing the three races. Zoospore progeny were screened to identify changes in virulence during asexual sporulation. A subset of zoospore progeny was subjected to Fluorescent Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism analysis to investigate genetic diversity generated through clonal sporulation. Results showed a gain and/or loss of virulence within all race progeny in soil and single-zoospore isolates. Race 1 was the most stable phenotype, with 91% in infested soil and 99.7% of the zoospore progeny retaining the virulence phenotype. The race structure in soil infested with races 0 and 3 were similar after five months. Races were recovered in a 2:1 ratio (race 0: race 3) with a small percentage of race 1. Races 0 and 3 zoospore progeny also segregated. Race 0 progeny were 67% race 0 and 33% gained virulence to the Phl gene (race 3). Similarly, 68% of the race 3-derived progeny retained the parental virulent phenotype, 31% lost the virulent phenotype (race 0), and 1% gained virulence to the Php gene (race 1). Estimates of genetic diversity within each group of related zoospores ranged from 0.17013 to 0.44196. Phenotypic and genotypic investigations revealed that asexual sporulation may be a major source of variation in natural populations. A state-wide survey of P. nicotianae populations was conducted in NC tobacco-producing regions. Isolates were obtained from 76 tobacco fields in 23 counties and screened for race and mating type. Race 1 was predominant in most regions, with 59% of fields consisting of 90 to 100% race 1. The occurrence of race 1 within fields was positively correlated with the history of monogenic resistance deployment. Race 3 was identified in low frequency throughout the state, primarily in wild-type populations where no monogenic resistance was deployed. The A1 and A2 mating types were found throughout NC and were recovered concurrently from multiple fields. Pairings of isolates from within fields yielded viable oospores, indicating for the first time, the potential for sexual reproduction by P. nicotianae. A subset of the survey isolates were screened for sensitivity to the fungicide mefenoxam. All isolates were sensitive, with a mean EC50 value of 0.4 &#206;&#188;g/ml mefenoxam, indicating fungicide applications are still a reliable method of black shank management. Results reveal a rapid state-wide shift toward race 1, correlating with the deployment of monogenic resistance and indicate that sexual recombination may be important in generating variation within the pathogen population.</field><field name="date">2009-07-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282009-154531/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paleopalynology of the Tar Heel Formation of Atlantic Coastal Plain of North Carolina, United States.</field><field name="creator">Mitra, Madhumi</field><field name="description">Sediments from the Late Cretaceous Tar Heel Formation in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of North Carolina were investigated for occurrence and distribution of palynomorphs. Exposures along rivers at Elizabethtown, Goldsboro, Ivanhoe, Lock, Willis Creek and Tar River in North Carolina were systematically collected. One hundred and three sediment samples were macerated by standard techniques modified by eliminating treatments with nitric acid and potassium hydroxide, and analyzed for palynomorphs. Eighty species of palynomorphs were distributed in 4 form genera of freshwater algae, 3 of dinoflagellates, 9 of fungi, 15 of pteridophytes, 11 of gymnosperms and 24 of angiosperms. Angiosperms were the dominant components in assemblages at all localities. Representatives of the Normapolles pollen group (characteristic angiosperm pollen group of middle and high northern latitudes of eastern North America and Europe) occur throughout the Tar Heel Formation and collectively comprise 29%-54% of the angiosperm assemblages. Palynological age assessment is in concordance with earlier dating determined by other workers based on invertebrate faunas. Minimum variance clustering with squared Euclidean distances in the Q-mode (clustering of samples) indicates that stratigraphically older layers of Ivanhoe, Lock and Willis Creek are similar in palynofloral composition, and one section of the Goldsboro locality is compositionally equivalent to the Tar River locality. Minimum variance cluster analysis in the R-mode (clustering of taxa) indicates the association of Campanian taxa in the same cluster. This reconfirms that localities of the Tar Heel Formation are of Early Campanian age. Informal biostratigraphic zones of Campanian (CA2-CA4) known from other Atlantic Coastal Plain deposits do not occur in the Tar Heel Formation. Quantitative analysis is consistent with the long-standing hypothesis of diversification and dominance of angiosperm pollen groups during the Campanian. The palynological record of the Tar Heel Formation, based on some indicator taxa with modern equivalents, suggests that subtropical to warm, moist temperate conditions prevailed in the southeastern region of North America during Campanian time.</field><field name="date">2002-04-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04292002-113849/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gravity Hill</field><field name="creator">Gravitte, Kristen</field><field name="description">Gravity Hill is a collection of poetry.</field><field name="date">2005-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04292005-095537/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparison of Chemical Pretreatment Methods for Converting Cotton Stalks to Ethanol</field><field name="creator">Silverstein, Rebecca Anne</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone pretreatments for conversion of cotton stalks to ethanol. Sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2% (w/v) were used to pretreat ground cotton stalk samples at a solid loading of 10% (w/v). Treatment temperatures of 90 degrees Celsius and 121 degrees Celsius at 15 psi were investigated for residence times of 30, 60, and 90 minutes. Ozone pretreatment was performed in the liquid phase at 4 degrees Celsius with constant sparging. Lignin, carbohydrate, and moisture content analyses were performed on the pretreated solids. The pretreated solids from sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, and hydrogen peroxide pretreatment (at 2%, 60 min, 121C/15psi) showed significant lignin degradation and/or high sugar availability and hence were hydrolyzed by cellulases from Trichoderma reesei and &#226;-glucosidase at 50 degrees Celsius. The results showed that time, temperature and concentration were all significant (p is less than or equal to 0.05) factors in delignification for NaOH and xylan removal for H2SO4. Sulfuric acid pretreatment resulted in the highest xylan reduction (95.23% for 2% acid, 90 min, 121C/15psi) during pretreatment and the lowest cellulose to glucose conversion during hydrolysis (23.85%). Sodium hydroxide pretreatment resulted in the highest level of delignification (65.63% for 2% NaOH, 90 min, 121C/15psi) and the highest cellulose conversion (60.8%). Hydrogen peroxide pretreatment resulted in significantly lower (p is less than or equal to 0.05) delignification (maximum of 29.51% with 2%, 30 min, 121C/15psi) and cellulose conversion (49.8%) than sodium hydroxide pretreatment, but had a higher (p is less than or equal to 0.05) conversion than sulfuric acid pretreatment. Ozone pretreatment showed no significant changes in lignin, xylan, or glucan contents with increasing time. Quadratic models using time, temperature, and concentration as numeric variables were developed to predict xylan reduction for H2SO4 pretreatment and lignin reduction for NaOH pretreatment. In addition, linear models relating a modified severity parameter (log Mo) combining the pretreatment parameters with xylan or lignin reduction were developed and resulted in R-squared values of 0.89 and 0.78, respectively.</field><field name="date">2005-05-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04292005-104024/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rat Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes as a Surrogate for Expression of TCDD Inducible Genes</field><field name="creator">Miller, Brian Douglas</field><field name="description">2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is persistent in the environment and the food chain resulting in a chronic exposure to human populations. The effects of this known human carcinogen are evaluated by measuring various TCDD-inducible endpoints. Cytochrome P450 1B1, a recently identified TCDD responsive gene, shows inducibility in both the rat and humans that is similar to Cytochrome P450 1A1, a widely accepted marker for TCDD responsiveness. In order to evaluate a Sprague Dawley rat model to predict human tissue effects with easily accessible human tissue, such as peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), rat PBL and granulocyte CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 expression were compared to expression among several tissues. Two treatment groups were used: an acute group, dosed with a 540 ng/kg single daily dose over a 3-day period followed by a day 4 sacrifice, and a chronic group, dosed biweekly with 7.6 ng/kg/day for 15 weeks. Competitive quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to show the different levels of expression of CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 in resting PBLs, granulocytes and various other tissues. CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 were shown to be inducible in liver, adrenal gland, lung, kidney, granulocytes and in PBLs. However, a lower induction for PBLs and granulocytes was observed compared to the highly inducible tissues such as liver and lung. Furthermore, male rats showed a 200-fold induction in CYP1B1 expression in PBLs and 16-fold induction in granulocytes in the chronic group following TCDD exposure compared to a 2 fold induction in PBLs and 2-fold induction in granulocytes for the female rats of the same dosing group. The differences in inducibility between PBLs, granulocytes and tissue may be due to the different levels of TCDD that reach each tissue due to the pharmacokinetics dependent upon that tissue. With the different expression patterns and low copy number of CYP1B1 and CYP1A1 in PBLs and granulocytes in Sprague Dawley rats, their use as surrogates for expression in tissues of interest does not correlate with recent published data for human studies on PBLs exposed to TCDD. Therefore, the comparison needs to be further investigated and the use of PBLs better established as a surrogate for expression.</field><field name="date">2005-05-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04292005-105927/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Involutions of SP(2n,k)</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Farrah Monique</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we discuss the relationship between involutions of the two matrix groups SL(2n,k) and SP(2n,k).

We begin by giving a complete classification of involutions of the group SL(n,k) over the algebraically closed fields, the real numbers, the rational numbers, and the finite fields. As a method of classifying a particular type of involution of SL(n,k) we focus on how they may be obtained from a non-degenerate symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. With the classification of involutions of SL(n,k) in hand we focus our attention on the subgroup SP(2n,k) of SL(2n,k). We first show that all involutions of SP(2n,k) are the restriction of an involution of SL(2n,k) to SP(2n,k). We determine that an automorphism theta=Inn_A leaves SP(2n,k) invariant if and only if A=pM for some p in k bar and M in SP(2n,k). Next we give specific criteria to characterize which involutions of SL(2n,k) remain involutions when restricted to SP(2n,k).

Maximum detection distance decreased on average by 36.61 m +- 5.44 with the addition of background noise, 29.52 m +- 6.25 with leaves on trees, and 35.68 m +- 5.58 between mixed pine/hardwood forest and deciduous forest. Average estimated detection probabilities varied greatly by factor combination and species, but in general they decreased with the addition of background noise, under leaf-on conditions, and in deciduous forest sites compared to mixed pine/hardwood sites. Average detection probabilities at 100 m ranged from 0 to 1 among species and under different environmental conditions. Average detection probability estimates never exceeded 0.19 for the Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia) at 100 m in deciduous forest. We found that a relative hearing index explained a maximum of 37% of the variation in observer detection probabilities. Interacting factors differed among species and were therefore difficult to predict. Environmental conditions can impart substantial bias in auditory point count data. We suggest estimating detection probability directly and incorporating this estimate in abundance estimates.</field><field name="date">2007-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04292007-102547/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Aerodynamic Analysis and Aeroelastic Tailoring of a Forward-Swept Wing</field><field name="creator">Roberts, David William</field><field name="description">The use of forward-swept wings has aerodynamic benefits at high angles of attack and in supersonic regimes. These consist of reduction in wave drag, profile drag, and increased high angle of attack handling qualities. These increased benefits are often offset due to an increase in structural components, to overcome flutter and wing tip divergence due to high loading of the wing tips at high angles of attack. The use of composite materials and aeroelastic tailoring of the structures eliminates these instabilities without a significant increase in weight. This work presents the design of an aeroelastic wing structure for a highly forward-swept wing, and the verification of the aerodynamic and structural finite element analysis through experimental testing.</field><field name="date">2006-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04302006-165940/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Materials Science and Sensing Applications of Surface Plasmon Resonance in Conducting Metal Oxides</field><field name="creator">Rhodes, Crissy Lynette</field><field name="description">Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was developed for the conducting metal oxide, indium tin oxide (ITO). This technique detects changes in the refractive index of a substrate produced by a monolayer or biomolecule binding. To determine if effective monolayer binding occurred, many characterization techniques were employed including reflectance FT-IR, XPS, and near edge X-ray fine structure absorption (NEAXFS) spectroscopy. The reflectance FT-IR experimental data revealed not only confirmation of monolayer formation but evidence for the existence of the plasma frequency (&#61559;p) as predicted by the Drude Free Electron Model. The XPS data was primarily used as corroborating deposition evidence and NEXAFS spectroscopy was vital in recognizing the order or disorder of a deposition monolayer. Fundamental studies with Indium tin oxide revealed a strong dependence of the excitation of surface plasmons upon preparation conditions, crystal orientation, and skin depth. Complementary theoretical studies allowed for separation of the different plasmonic contributions in the thin film.</field><field name="date">2007-06-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04302007-162038/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Apparent Electrical Conductivity (ECa) via Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) to Characterize Soils and the Stratigraphy for Wetland Restoration</field><field name="creator">Davis, Karen Melissa</field><field name="description">Wetland restoration can be difficult due to the time consuming efforts it requires to evaluate the soils and vegetation within the area being considered. The objective of this study was to determine whether apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) measured via electromagnetic induction (EMI) (a non-contact method) could be used to identify soil particle size distribution, map units, and selected chemical properties at a Carolina bay wetland restoration site, Juniper Bay. Surveys of ECa were performed at Juniper Bay in December 2000, June 2001, October 2005, and December 2005 using the EM38, GEM-2, and GEM-300 in the horizontal and vertical dipole positions. Cores were dug to depths of 6.1 and 15.2 m based on an equilateral triangle grid and adequate representative sampling of soil map units. Pits were dug to 1- and 1.5-m depths. Core and pit samples were analyzed for particle size distribution and soil chemical properties. Surficial samples were collected from 0- to 15-cm and 15- to 30-cm depths; chemical properties were evaluated on these samples. Correlations of ECa with soil particle size distribution and chemical properties were determined. Linear models were derived relating soil clay content and ECa. Soil ECa was compared with soil organic C and water table depth to determine if either property could be detected using EMI. Also, ECa from different survey dates were compared to determine whether there were short-term (within a day) and long-term (months to years) temporal changes in ECa. The ECa from the initial overall December 2000 survey was strongly correlated with soil core clay content at depths from 0.61 to 1.22 m and 2.74 to 3.96 m. The reason for this is unknown. Initial overall December 2000 ECa was also strongly correlated with pit clay content. No other soil core or pit particle size analysis properties had strong significant and consistent correlations with ECa for the December 2000 survey or for any of the other surveys. Few chemical properties were correlated with ECa; however, ECa was weakly correlated with pit organic C. Results showed that ECa could not be used to delineate soil map unit, but the map unit ECa means were different. However, ECa could not detect water table depth at Juniper Bay. Soil ECa was found to be temporally variable, and ECa surveyors should be conscious of potentially varying conditions from survey to survey. Along with ground-truthing, ECa modeling could be used to estimate clay content at certain depths and locations within Juniper Bay. This could aid wetland restoration by identifying locations of aquitards, which might have been penetrated by drainage ditches. Filling the ditches in the correct places could allow restoration to progress faster and more efficiently.</field><field name="date">2007-07-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04302007-204731/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Microstructural Characterization of High Strength Aluminum Alloys</field><field name="creator">Lee, William Morgan</field><field name="description">The use of aluminum alloys for commercial and military applications has increased substantially due to the alloys&#226; low areal density, toughness, and processability. It has recently been shown that an aluminum alloy, Al 2139, with copper, magnesium, and silver can be significantly toughened and strengthened by combinations of &#206;&#184;&#226; and &#206;&#169; precipitates and dispersed manganese particles. What has not been quantified are how these precipitates and dispersed particles affect behavior and what the material mechanisms and microstructural characteristics are that control the behavior of Al 2139 for strain-rates that span the quasi-static to high rates of strain. Hence, in this investigation, detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), orientation imaging microscopy (OIM), and optical microscopy (OM) were used to delineate the different physical scales that range from the nano for the precipitates and dislocations to the micron for the dispersed particles, grain orientations and texture, grain-sizes, slip-bands, and grain-boundary orientations. The deformed specimens were from an Al 2139 plate that was impacted by 4340 steel fragmentation stimulating projectiles (FSPs) at impact velocities ranging from 813 to 1043 m/s. The majority of the projectiles were defeated by the Al 2139 plate, which is another indication of the alloy&#226;s potential for damage mitigation and projectile defeat and resistance. Based on this detailed microstructural characterization, mechanisms for projectile defeat and full penetration are proposed. Deformation and damage modes include petalling on the impact face, shear cracking through the middle section of the plate due to projectile penetration, and discing due to bending stresses at a spall plane near the back of the plate. Shear cracking appears to be GB related, and the discing is dependent on the rolling direction. The extent of these modes for cross-sections where the target was penetrated was greater than that in regions where the projectile was defeated. For projectile defeat, large and elongated grains and precipitate deformation due to dislocation interaction can lead to highly ductile performance, which resists discing failure and plate penetration. Large grains significantly reduce the fraction of GBs, which then reduces the amount of GB cracking due to intense shear accumulation and spall. The elongation of the grains due to rolling also increased the dislocation densities, and subsequently the ductility of the grains, which reduced tensile failure due to the bending in the discing regions. High angle GB&#226;s can also limit heterogeneous &#206;&#184;&#226; precipitation at the GB&#226;s, which would reduce intergranular fracture. Precipitation of &#206;&#169; also increases the spall strength and decreases localized shear through its multiple cutting interactions with dislocations at the matrix interface. Dispersed particles also increase the strength of the alloy in high strain-rate applications by resisting localized shear. The results of this study are a first step in developing a tailored methodology that can be used to optimize microstructural characteristics and behavior of aluminum alloys for optimal strength and toughness.</field><field name="date">2008-05-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04302008-114019/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Propagation by Stem Cuttings and Nitrogen Nutrition of Eastern Redbud (&lt;i&gt;Cercis canadensis&lt;/i&gt;)</field><field name="creator">Wooldridge, John Michael</field><field name="description">A series of studies were conducted with eastern redbud (&lt;i&gt;Cercis canadensis&lt;/i&gt; L.) to identify clones with rooting potential, determine the optimum growth stage for taking stem cuttings, investigate the effect of auxin treatment on rooting of stem cuttings, and determine optimum nitrogen (N) nutrition for seedlings grown in containers. The first study consisted of two experiments, one utilizing softwood cuttings and the other semi-hardwood cuttings, to investigate the influence of growth stage and auxin treatment on rooting of four related clones of eastern redbud. The clones were &#226;Flame&#226;, dwarf white, and two selections (NC99-6-1 and NC99-6-2) of an F1 generation of a cross of &#226;Flame&#226; and dwarf white. At each growth stage, rooting responses of the clones varied and were influenced greatly by auxin treatment, demonstrating the variable rooting potential of the genotypes. In both experiments, &#226;Flame&#226; rooted well [63% rooting in the softwood experiment when treated with the potassium (K) salt (K-salt) of indolebutyric acid at 5000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;(ppm), 83% rooting when treated in the semi-hardwood experiment with K-IBA at 10,000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;]. For the softwood cutting experiment, cuttings of dwarf white (46%) and NC99-6-2 (75%) rooted best when treated with K-IBA at 15,000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Softwood cuttings of NC99-6-1 rooted most successfully (46%) when treated with K-IBA at 10,000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Dwarf white and the F1s rooted poorly in the semi-hardwood experiment. In the second study, stem cuttings of four popular clones of eastern redbud (&#226;Ace of Hearts&#226;, &#226;Appalachian&#226;, &#226;Forest Pansy&#226;, and &#226;Hearts of Gold&#226;) were taken on seven dates following budbreak during Spring and Summer 2007 and evaluated for rooting potential. Rooting was affected by a clone x cutting date interaction, indicating the optimum time to take cuttings was different for each clone. Cuttings of &#226;Ace of Hearts&#226; taken 6 weeks after budbreak (WAB) rooted at 75% and 71% when treated with K-IBA at 5000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 15,000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. In contrast, cuttings of &#226;Appalachian&#226; rooted at 96% and 93% when taken 15 WAB, the last date tested for that clone, and treated with K-IBA at 5000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 15,000 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

Cuttings of &#226;Forest Pansy&#226; rooted poorly no matter when they were collected or the K-IBA treatment. In the final study, containerized seedlings of eastern redbud were grown in a greenhouse for 10 weeks with N application rates (NARs) ranging from 0 to 300 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Seedlings fertilized with N at 180 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; had the greatest leaf area, leaf dry weight, and total dry weight. Plants allocated more resources to root growth at NARs &lt; 60 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. At NARs &#226;&#165; 60 mg&#226;&#162;L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, allocation of carbohydrates to roots and tops was constant, with a root:top ratio of 0.25. Foliar concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus increased linearly with increasing NAR while concentrations of potassium were not affected by NAR.</field><field name="date">2008-05-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04302008-115630/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Methodology for Translating Detonation Wave Effects between One and Two Dimensions</field><field name="creator">Susi, Bryan</field><field name="description">This research focuses on evaluating empirical methods and implementing a prototype Transitional Airblast Model (TRAM) for facilitating communication between one-dimensional and two-dimensional airblast models. An overview of detonation phenomena is presented, especially concerning detonation waves and accompanying airblast effects. Two existing airblast models are discussed that were designed to predict the effects of a detonation in two separate types of geometries, one-dimensional and two-dimensional. The functionality and behavior of each airblast model will be scrutinized giving particular insight into their performance in applications with both one-dimensional and two-dimensional components. The strengths and deficiencies of the different airblast models will offer motivation for the development of the TRAM prototype. The TRAM prototype consists of two separate methodologies, one for translating one-dimensional airblast propagation to two dimensions, and another for translating two-dimensional airblast propagation to one dimension. The selection of those two methodologies will be presented, along with results of detonation scenarios using both existing airblast models as well as the TRAM prototype. The TRAM prototype performed well for both types of detonation scenarios and is recommended for further development.</field><field name="date">2008-05-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04302008-202701/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Law, Legislation, and Lending: An Examination of the Influence of the Crusades on the Usury Prohibition</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Matthew James</field><field name="description">The focus of this work is an exploration of the potential impact of the economic necessities of crusading on the usury prohibition of the Latin Church.

The question remains as to why, especially in a period of corresponding commercial growth. The protection of combatants became an area of critical importance, as highlighted by the canonical legislation of the period. Property protection, the continuance of fair market practices, and the extended policy of limiting trade with the Saracens each played a crucial role in the enforcement of usury statues.

Multiple locus sequence typing (MLST) showed that the major sequence types (STs) were turkey-specific. Further subtyping using fla typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI and KpnI as well as plasmid profiles revealed that each of the major MDR STs contained strains of related, but distinct subtypes, providing evidence for genomic diversification within these STs. Numerous strains, with indistinguishable PFGE profiles, but different fla types suggested selection for specific flagellin sequences. The observed correlation between STs and the MDR profiles of the microbes indicates that MLST-based typing holds potential for source-tracking applications specific to the animal source (turkeys) and the antimicrobial resistance profile (MDR) of C. coli. The molecular basis for resistance of MDR strains to selected antimicrobials was investigated, and tetracycline resistant isolates were shown to harbor tet(O). Natural transformation studies were used to study the mechanism of transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in C. coli. Resistance to erythromycin and nalidixic acid/ciprofloxacin mediated by chromosomal sequences, were easily transferred from MDR strains to other C. coli, whereas resistance to tetracycline and kanamycin was not possible by transformation, suggesting that genes mediating these resistance attributes were plasmid-borne in MDR strains. Interestingly, tetracycline resistance could be readily transferred by transformation using DNA from another clonal group of C. coli strains prevalent in turkeys, suggesting chromosomal presence of the tetracycline resistance gene. MDR strains were found to be stable and maintained their MDR phenotype over 60 serial passages in vitro. The strains maintained their PFGE and plasmid profiles; and only minor differences in MICs before and after the 60 passages were observed. The findings from this study suggest that the certain strain types and clonal groups are prevalent among MDR C. coli from turkeys, and that resistance determinants to certain antibiotics can be transferred from these MDR strains to other C. coli strains.</field><field name="date">2007-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05012007-090334/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abundance, Fruit Presence, and Growth Enhancement of Prestoea montana and Roystonea borinquena, Two Palm Species of Importance to Amazona vittata (Puerto Rican Parrot), in R&#237;o Abajo Forest, Puerto Rico.</field><field name="creator">Malone, Meredith B.</field><field name="description">The endangered Puerto Rican parrot (Amazona vittata) has been bred in captivity for decades, and since 2000, over 50 parrots have been released into native habitats to rebuild wild populations in Puerto Rico. One group of 21 parrots was released into R&#237;o Abajo Forest in the karstic region of Puerto Rico in November 2006, where high quality habitat resources exist, but the management of sustainable food resources, such as the fruit of Prestoea montana (sierra palm) and Roystonea borinquena (royal palm), is imperative. An inventory of accessible regions in R&#237;o Abajo Forest was conducted to assess differences in size and abundance of P. montana and R. borinquena palms between three forest community types and fruiting patterns under differing growing conditions. Twenty palms in each of three size classes of both palm species were located in R&#237;o Abajo Forest and approximately half were supplied with a controlled-release formula of inorganic NPK fertilizer with micronutrients to investigate potential soil nutrient limitations to growth of palms. Thirty R. borinquena seedlings were located in artificial canopy gap plots previously created in abandoned Hibiscus elatus (mahoe) plantations in R&#237;o Abajo Forest and approximately half were supplied with the same fertilizer formula to evaluate combined soil and light limitations on seedling growth. In the size and abundance inventory, seedlings were the most abundant size class of both palm species. No significant difference in size or abundance existed between any size classes of either palm species in different forest community types. P. montana seedling size and abundance were correlated with moderate shade, available soil P and other micronutrients, and relatively alkaline soils. Seedling height and diameter significantly increased with the addition of NPK and micronutrients to surrounding soil. Wet soils appeared most important to fruit production of mature P. montana. In the size and abundance inventory, R. borinquena seedling success was correlated to sites containing relatively high soil micronutrient concentrations and seedlings and mature R. borinquena palms exhibited larger size, abundance, and fruit production in open canopies. R. borinquena seedling height significantly increased with the addition of N-P-K and micronutrients to surrounding soil. Diameter significantly increased with the addition of fertilizer to soil surrounding seedlings in artificial canopy gap plots. Mortality was decreased in R. borinquena seedlings with the addition of fertilizer, under the full canopies of fertilizer experiments and in the open canopies of artificial canopy gap plots. Management to increase abundance and fruit production of these palm species in RAF may initially include techniques to provide increased light availability and nutrients to mature R. borinquena. Strategic management objectives may include provision of the same resources to smaller R. borinquena and increased soil moisture and nutrients to P. montana of all sizes.</field><field name="date">2007-07-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05012007-121725/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimodel Ensembles of Streamflow Forecasts: Role of Predictor State in Developing Optimal Combination.</field><field name="creator">Devineni, Naresh</field><field name="description">Information on season-ahead streamflow forecasts is beneficial for the operation and management of water supply systems. Developing such long-lead (3-12 months) stream flow forecasts typically depend on exogenous climatic conditions particularly sea surface temperature (SSTs) conditions in tropical oceans. Identification of such conditions that influence the moisture transport into water resources regions is important to develop low-dimensional statistical models and to analyze climatic forecasts from General Circulation Models (GCMs). The main purpose of this study is to develop probabilistic streamflow forecasts for the Falls Lake Reservoir, NC, for the summer season that is critical for developing water management strategies so that the City of Raleigh?s water demands could be met through water conservation measures. The study develops two low-dimensional statistical models based on SSTs in the tropical Pacific, tropical Atlantic and over the NC Coast. Given that prediction from any model is bound to have unavoidable error/model uncertainty, the study intends to combine the forecasts from individual models to develop an improved multi-model forecast. For this purpose, the study develops an algorithm for combining forecasts from individual forecasts by evaluating the performance of individual forecasts contingent on climatic (predictor) conditions. The methodology is demonstrated through the development of multi-model ensembles of streamflow forecasts for the Falls Lake reservoir by combining probabilistic streamflow forecasts from two low dimensional statistical models. Using Rank Probability Score (RPS) for evaluating each year?s streamflow forecasts for the summer months (July-August-September) from the two low dimensional models, the methodology proportionately gives higher representation by drawing increased ensembles for a model that has better predictability under similar predictor conditions. The performance of the multi-model forecasts is compared with the individual model?s performance using various performance evaluation measures. By developing multi-model ensembles based on leave-one out cross validation and split sampling, the study shows that evaluating the model?s performance based on the predictor state provides a better alternative in developing multi-model ensembles instead of combining the models purely based on their long-term predictability. The method is also extended to combine various GCMs to get improved winter (December-January-February) precipitation forecast for the entire US. Finally the study shows the utility of the multi model precipitation ensembles to develop improved streamflow forecasts for the Falls Lake through statistical downscaling.</field><field name="date">2007-05-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05012007-153021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post Heat Treatment Effects of Ti-6Al-4V Produced via Solid Freeform Electron Beam Melting</field><field name="creator">Ervin, Jennifer Kelly</field><field name="description">Traditionally, Ti-6Al-4V components are fabricated by forging or casting. However, these methods of production require expensive dies or molds. The cost per part is very high for those parts produced in low quantities. The solid freeform electron beam melting process aims to produce high dimensional tolerance parts with similar mechanical properties at a lower cost by melting Ti-6Al-4V powder in a layer by layer fashion using high energy electrons. Due to the directional solidification effects, the microstructure seen in this process consists of a columnar grain structure along the growth direction and an equiaxed structure at the cross-sectional growth plane. This type of structure is thought to contribute to the anisotropy of tensile properties discovered in previous research. Although, preferred orientation of the &#206;&#177; laths may play a role as well. Heat treatments above the &#206;&#178; transus are performed in order to improve the tensile properties, specifically ductility, with intensions to remove preferred orientation and to disunite the columnar grain structure. Tensile testing, fractography, optical microscopy, and x-ray diffraction are used to characterize and compare the as-processed and &#206;&#178; heat treated electron beam melted specimens. It is found for all &#206;&#178; treated conditions, the ductility increases compared to the as-processed specimens, although the strength decreases. The mode of fracture changes from ductile dimple rupture in the asprocessed condition to transgranular cleavage with ductile dimple rupture for the heat treated specimens. The macrostructure and microstructure in the as-processed and heat treated specimens contrasted greatly. The macrostructure changes from a fully columnar structure to a mixture of columnar and equiaxed grains. A fine acicular microstructure is observed in the as-processed samples, whereas a broad lamellar colony microstructure is formed during heat treatment. The presence of a colony microstructure is a possible reason for the improvement in ductility. From the x-ray data obtained, the preferred orientation is not reduced but instead increases after heat treating in the &#206;&#178; region which likely is a result of the favorable rearrangement of slip systems due to the change in &#206;&#177; lath orientation.</field><field name="date">2008-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05012008-105845/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Database Level Implementation To Enforce Fine Grained Access Control</field><field name="creator">Arjun, Vinod</field><field name="description">As privacy protection has gained significant importance, organizations have been forced to protect individual preferences and comply with many enacted privacy laws. This has been a strong driving force for access control in relational databases. Traditional relation level access control is insufficient to address the increasingly complex requirements of access control policies where each cell in the relation might be governed by a separate policy. In order to address this demand, we are in need of a more fine grained access control scheme, at the row-level or even the cell-level. A recent research paper proposed correctness criteria for query evaluation algorithms enforcing fine grained access control and showed that existing approaches did not satisfy the criteria. In addition, the paper proposed a query modification approach to implement a sound and secure query evaluation algorithm enforcing fine grained access control. To evaluate queries involving moderate table sizes of 50000 and 100000 records we experimentally find that the implementation takes approximately 8 and 32 seconds respectively. This is approximately 10 times, on an average, slower than query evaluation algorithms without access control. This performance gap increases significantly with increase in table size, thus rendering it impractical. In this thesis, we modify the query evaluation engine of POSTGRESQL to enforce fine grained access control at the database level. We address a few challenges and propose optimizations to counter inefficiencies that we encounter when moving the access control scheme to the database level. We analyze the performance of our implementation using data sets with various properties and find that it performs approximately 10 times better compared to the query modification approach on moderate table sizes of 50000 and 100000 records. Also, we find that our implementation scales well with table size. Experimental results show that our implementation is comparable to the performance of query evaluation algorithms without access control and hence is practical.</field><field name="date">2008-05-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05012008-123255/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Target Costing Principles in Publically Funded Green Buildings</field><field name="creator">Perez, Jaime Mauricio</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to propose a Target Costing principles-based frame work for publically funded Green Buildings.

The results from this research were gathered to create a Green Building specific Target Costing application framework which includes a flow chart, and a list of barriers and solutions.</field><field name="date">2009-06-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Construction Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05012009-221017/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the Multiple Solvent Crystal Structures Method to Analyze the Protein Binding Surface of H-Ras Protein</field><field name="creator">Buhrman, Gregory Kale</field><field name="description">H-Ras is a member of the small, monomeric GTPase protein superfamily. H-Ras functions as a ?molecular switch?, using nucleotide dependent conformational changes to relay signals in a number of signal transduction pathways. Mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 creates an oncogenic version of the protein which does not hydrolyze GTP, resulting in the constitutive activation of downstream effector proteins. Ras proteins participate in multiple protein : protein interactions in the cell, making Ras a good candidate protein to extend the Multiple Solvent Crystal Structures method (MSCS) to the analysis and prediction of protein binding surfaces. MSCS involves solving the crystal structure of the protein after soaking the protein crystal in a variety of organic solvent molecules. Replacing an aqueous solvent with an organic solvent affects the Ras protein structure in several ways. The disordered Switch II region of Ras is ordered in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol or 1,6-hexanediol. Polar interactions that stabilize the ordered switch are enhanced in the presence of hydrophobic co-solvents. This suggests that hydrophobic solvents can be used in general to order short biologically relevant segments of disordered regions in protein crystals. We have used MSCS to study two crystal forms of active H-Ras bound to a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog (GMPPNP). We have also solved the structure of an oncogenic mutant of H-Ras (Q61L) in a non-canonical crystal form. This crystal form of H-Ras shows a new conformation for the flexible Switch II region that is not affected by crystal packing forces. This provides a structural explanation for the oncogenic properties of the Q61L mutation, showing that the Q61L mutation stabilizes a non-catalytic conformation of Switch II. MSCS analysis of Ras identifies the known Ras-effector binding domain as a site of protein: protein interaction and predicts a new protein binding site that is located in a large, solvent exposed pocket between Switch II and helix 3. In applying MSCS to the Ras protein, we show that by using polar organic solvent molecules as probes, we can identify binding sites that are highly charged and dynamic.</field><field name="date">2005-05-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05022005-064543/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender Stereotypes about Emotion Portrayed in Children's Picture Books</field><field name="creator">Craig, Ashley B</field><field name="description">The purpose of the present study was to investigate the emotional messages in children&#226;s picture books and how they differ by both gender and age. Specifically, I hypothesized that female characters would be illustrated and described in the text as more emotional than males especially with regards to love, sadness, and fear whereas male characters were hypothesized to be illustrated and described more often as angry than females. These differences were also considered by age of the character, especially for sadness and anger whereby adult males were hypothesized to be portrayed showing the least sadness and adults were hypothesized to be portrayed expressing more anger than children. Lastly, the present study was intended to examine the gender-emotion stereotypes in children&#226;s picture books over time, and so a sample of current best-selling books published between 1950 and present were selected. Results revealed that gender-emotion stereotypes were less prevalent than expected, but that in fact females were portrayed expressing more love than males and males more anger than females. Further, adults were portrayed expressing more love and anger than children. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-08-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05022008-085227/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emission of Non-methane Organic Compounds (NMOCs) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) from Decomposing Refuse and Individual Waste Components and Under Different Conditions</field><field name="creator">Cowie, Stephen James</field><field name="description">Lab scale reactors were used to measure the emissions of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs)and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from decomposing refuse.

Decomposition of MSW under aerobic and nitrate-reducing conditions was also studied. NMOC yields ranged from 0.016 mg-C/dry gm (paper) to 0.347 mg-C/dry gm (food).

Since subclass distributions can vary widely from person to person, individuals with the same levels of LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol may be at different cardiovascular risk and respond differently to dietary and drug therapy. Unfortunately, existing laboratory methods of subclass measurement are too time-consuming and expensive to be used in routine clinical practice. Using a new approach to lipoprotein analysis that exploits the natural proton NMR spectroscopic differences exhibited by lipoprotein particles of different size, we have developed a new quantitative NMR technology for use in clinical laboratory medicine. The newly developed NMR LipoProfile assay rapidly and simultaneously quantifies the lipoprotein subclass particle concentrations of 10 lipoprotein species (3 VLDL, IDL, 3 LDL and 3 HDL) with good intraassay and interassay precision. Extensive validation studies were conducted that established robustness of the NMR lipoprotein particle assay. The average particle sizes of the major lipoprotein classes determined by NMR correlate very well with those estimated by gradient gel electrophoresis. Emerging clinical data from several coronary disease outcome studies indicate that NMR-derived lipoprotein particle parameters are superior predictors of cardiovascular disease risk compared to traditional cholesterol risk factors. The speed and efficiency of NMR lipoprotein subclass profiling make it a potentially valuable research tool and cost-effective means of assessing and managing heart disease risk in the general population.</field><field name="date">2005-05-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05032005-105307/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic and Stochastic Modeling of Various Components of the Hydrological Cycle for East Africa</field><field name="creator">Davis, Neil Nathaniel</field><field name="description">This research has investigated the ability to model precipitation over East Africa using the RegCM regional climate model, and the ability of a stochastic model to predict Lake Victoria lake level one season in advance.

Gwynn</field><field name="description">Narrative coherence, or the measure of how well a particular memory has been structurally organized and interpreted, is receiving increased attention from memory researchers, likely due to its presumed links with effective coping and long-term remembering. The current study shed light on this important but elusive construct by exploring factors that influenced coherence in children?s personal memory narratives of events that occurred in both the recent and distant past. Specifically, 112 4- to 8-year-old children were asked to remember parent-nominated events that transpired within the past 4 months. One year later, when the children were 5- to 9-years-old, they were asked to remember both the previously discussed events that occurred over a year in the past and more recent events that occurred within the past 4 months. The research employed a recently devised standardized coding scheme to examine the chronology and theme dimensions of coherence in the children?s memory narratives. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that 8-year-olds produced memory narratives that were significantly higher in both the theme and chronology dimensions of coherence than 4- and 6-year-olds. Multilevel modeling of children?s recent memories indicated that verbal comprehension scores related positively to both theme and chronology, but only the theme dimension was affected by memory breadth. Further, a child?s current reporting ability was found to be a significant influence on the theme and chronology of children?s narratives of events that transpired over a year in the past, but these dimensions of coherence were no longer affected by the initial breadth of that memory. Overall, the influences on children?s narrative coherence differ both between the theme and chronology dimensions and between recent versus distant memories. Implications for memory research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007-05-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05032007-112000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of spatial resolution on an object-oriented classification of downed timber</field><field name="creator">Swain, Jeff B</field><field name="description">Advancements in remote sensing technology continue to aid natural disaster damage assessment. Quick and accurate damage assessment significantly increases the speed of recovery efforts and allows aid to reach those most severely affected. Object-oriented classification techniques require minimal user input to remotely classify large areas and may be utilized to provide timely and accurate damage assessments of affected areas. In this study, I explored the use of object-oriented classification techniques to classify downed timber areas in the Dare County Bombing Range in North Carolina. The spatial resolution of scanned color-infrared aerial photography was degraded from 0.2-meter to 3 other spatial resolutions (1-meter, 5-meter, and 10-meter). Training data developed from the 0.2-meter pixel imagery were used to establish training data for all spatial resolutions. Each set of images was classified using object-oriented classification techniques. Results were compared statistically to each other and to results obtained from a manual delineation and a conventional supervised classification. Before the accuracy assessment began, we anticipated that the classification produced by the 0.2-meter imagery would be the most accurate due to the high level of detail in the imagery. After comparing the results of the classifications, there was no statistically significant difference among the object-oriented classifications, but there was a significant difference between the object-oriented results and the other classifications. Using the training data created on the high-resolution imagery to classify the coarser spatial resolution imagery did not cause classification accuracy loss. The potential damage assessment impact of this technique is that low-resolution imagery can be utilized to quickly classify damaged areas, provided high-resolution imagery is used to create training data. This classification technique demonstrates that damage assessment can be accomplished less expensively, without sacrificing accuracy and speed.</field><field name="date">2007-08-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05042007-150056/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Conquest of Woolsorters? Disease (Industrial Anthrax) That Never Happened</field><field name="creator">Collier, Sarah Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis will examine the triumph over anthrax that never really happened. In the history of diseases and medicine, Triumphalism or the triumphal story is a common genre of historical writing. At first glance, it may seem as if the standard triumphal story applies to the history of anthrax. Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur, the heroes of bacteriology, made their major discoveries in anthrax in the 1870s and 1880s. Then, John Henry Bell?s work in the Bradford wool mills in England created a practical application of Koch and Pasteur?s findings. Bell makes his recommendations to the British government, and the story is over. The disease is understood, and thus there is a medical standard to follow. But it is doubtful that there will be very many more cases because science and medicine have solved the problem. Unfortunately, this narrative is just too simple, and in this thesis, I will show how anthrax does not fit into the mold of a triumphal story and is, instead, a story about an industrial disease from the beginning using outbreaks and legislation that manifested after Koch, Pasteur, and Bell made their breakthroughs in the 1880s.</field><field name="date">2007-06-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05042007-194510/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci in Outbred Half-sib Populations</field><field name="creator">Gong, Xiaohua</field><field name="description">Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in outbred populations faces some challenges unique to the divergent genetic background and complex pedigree relationships. Motivated by a dairy cattle half-sib data set from a grand daughter design, we present in this dissertation a series of endeavors to address various challenges along the analysis flow of QTL mapping. A first step is to infer the haplotypes in sires based on the observed genotypes in sires and his offspring. Our method was shown to outperform peer methods with greater robustness and accuracy yet with fast speed performance. Then in light of adapting the multiple interval mapping method to within-family QTL analysis, we extended the modeling framework by allowing for heteroscedastic residual variances and upgraded the Windows QTL Cartographer accordingly. The advantageous post-analysis result parsing from Windows QTL Cartographer and more importantly, the improved analysis outputs due to more powerful maximum likelihood-based mixture modeling than the least squares regression manifest our efforts in delivering better methodology via practically user friendly software. We further developed a mixed model approach for the purpose of QTL mapping across multiple families that was aimed at modeling QTL effects as both the fixed effect across families and the random effect within families. Our mixed model was shown to encompass similar or higher statistical testing performance on QTL variation than the widely used variance component modeling approach, yet still allowing permutations for obtaining chromosome-wide or genome-wide significance threshold. What's more, the flexibility of our mixed model in constructing alternative hypotheses testing on either fixed or random QTL effects or both was shown to offer interesting insight into the varying sources of signal that would not be unveiled by least squares regression or variance component methods. In concluding our comprehensive approach to QTL linkage mapping in dairy cattle populations, we continue to explore methods of fine mapping by combining both the linkage disequilibrium and linkage information and prospective method improvements are being sought.</field><field name="date">2009-05-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Co-major in Bioinformatics and Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05042009-160015/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial Polypeptides, Piscidins and Histone-Like Proteins, in Important Aquacultured Fish and the Effect of Nutrition on their Expression and Susceptibility to Infection in Hybrid Striped (Sunshine) Bass (Morone saxatilis &#226; x M. chrysops &#226;)</field><field name="creator">Corrales, Jone</field><field name="description">Innate immunity is the initial response of a host in defending against pathogen invasion (Beutler 2004, Janeway and Medzhitov 2002). The key features of an innate immune response are that it is: non-specific (broad-spectrum), rapid (often within minutes to hours) and conserved in its pattern of recognition. Antimicrobial polypeptides (AMPP) are a key component of the innate system and present in virtually all life forms (Zasloff 2002). One of the most widespread AMPP in fish are the piscidins. Piscidins have potent, broad-spectrum activity against viruses (Chinchar et al 2004), bacteria (Silphaduang and Noga 2001), fungi (Lauth et al 2002) and parasites (Colorni et al, Accepted). Another family of AMPP are histone-like proteins (HLPs), which are highly homologous to core nuclear histones (Robinette et al 1998, Noga et al 2002). Because disease is often the major cause of economic losses in fish farming, understanding how stress affects innate immunity (e.g., expression of AMPP) and thus disease susceptibility could be highly beneficial to the industry. One very important factor that can contribute to stress in aquaculture is inadequate nutrition. Feed is the single largest expenditure in semi-intensive and intensive farms (Lunger et al 2007, Twibell et al 2003, Mbahinzireki et al 2001). Thus, reducing feed costs while still maintaining optimal health is critical for successful production. As nutrient intake decreases, metabolic processes are impaired and susceptibility to disease increases. I anticipated that this would be reflected in the levels of piscidins and HLPs. The overall goal was to investigate the levels of these antibiotics that indicate fish are stressed prior to any pathological signs. For this first, an ELISA for piscidin 4 was developed and validated and its application to asses stress was confirmed. Using this ELISA and various other independent assays the presence of piscidin 4 related AMPP were detected in important aquacultured fish. Next, I found that nutritional deprivation has a deleterious effect on piscidin 4 expression and that susceptibility to an ich increases in hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis &#226;x M. chrysops &#226;). The nutritional deprivation also lead to dermatological condition in channel catfish.</field><field name="date">2008-05-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05052008-171103/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender Equity Issues in Technology Education: A Qualitative Approach to Uncovering the Barriers</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in order to discover existing barriers that discourage females from enrolling in technology education (TED) classes in high school and college and to offer suggestions on ways to overcome those barriers.

One of these theories, known as autoantigen complementarity, states that the initiator of an autoimmune response may not be the target autoantigen itself or an exogenous mimic, but instead is a peptide or protein that is &#226;antisense&#226; or &#226;complementary&#226; in shape and/or charge to the autoantigen. The first immune response is therefore production of an antibody specific for this complementary protein, followed by an anti-antibody (i.e. anti-idiotypic antibody) that reacts with the paratope of the first antibody and also recognizes the &#226;sense&#226; or self-protein due to surface contour, charge, and/or hydropathy complementarity. Our laboratory group has published evidence for autoantigen complementarity in one autoimmune glomerular disease, proteinase-3 specific antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody glomerulonephritis. The overall objective of the work described here was to provide further evidence for complementary proteins as inciting antigens in autoimmune glomerulonephritis using anti-GBM disease as the classic antibody-mediated autoimmune glomerulopathy; our central hypothesis was that anti-GBM disease is caused by a protein or peptide complementary to the anti-GBM autoantigen. The design of synthetic peptides complementary in sequence to portions of the human and rat &#206;&#177;3(IV)NC1 collagen domains, and the design and production of a recombinant complementary &#206;&#177;3(IV)NC1 protein more likely to possess appropriate tertiary structure to be complementary in sequence and in structure to the full-length anti-GBM epitope are described. These antigens were used to demonstrate that a subset of patients with anti-GBM disease have anti-idiotypic antibodies specific for &#206;&#177;3(IV)NC1-complementary peptides and proteins, that these antibodies are distinct from their pathogenic idiotypic partners, and that the anti-GBM antibodies bind to these anti-complementary protein antibodies as expected by idiotypic:anti-idiotypic partners. Finally, we describe the immunologic and clinicopathologic consequences of immunization of two rodent models with anti-GBM-complementary peptides, thus providing provisional evidence for autoantigen complementarity-induced anti-GBM disease.</field><field name="date">2008-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05062008-155750/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of Co-Siderophore Complexes by Ligand-Promoted Dissolution</field><field name="creator">Bi, Yuqiang</field><field name="description">Recent research indicates that siderophores, a class of biogenic ligands with known exceptional affinity for Fe(III), can also strongly complex Co(III), an element essential to normal metabolic function of microbes and animals. This study was conducted to examine the siderophore-promoted dissolution rates and mechanisms of Co from model synthetic Co-bearing minerals to elucidate the role of siderophores in biogeochemical processes of Co. Dissolution of heterogenite (CoOOH) and four Co-goethites (Co-FeOOH) with different levels of Co substitution were investigated in the presence of a trihydroxamate siderophore, desferrioxamine B (DFOB), using batch and flow-through experiments, respectively. By measuring the complex and total metal concentrations in dissolution products, dissolution rates via multiple pathways were measured as a function of pH. Results showed that DFOB promoted dissolution of Co from Co-bearing minerals via pH-dependent mechanisms. For heterogenite, ligand-promoted dissolution was the dominant pathway at neutral to alkaline pH, while reductive dissolution became dominant for pH &lt; 6. Cobalt substitution in Co-goethite resulted in increased total dissolution rates of both Co and Fe, but ligand-promoted and reductive Co dissolution pathways were difficult to examine due to the slow dissolution rates. The fast dissolution rate of heterogenite, coupled with the high affinity of Co(III) for DFOB, suggests that siderophore-promoted dissolution of Co(III) oxides is a biogeochemically favorable process. Although the association of Co with Fe oxide mineral may limit the Co dissolution rate, siderophore-promoted Co dissolution may still be an effective enough way to increase Co bioavailability. The results also suggest the possibility of radionuclide 60Co by siderophores from recalcitrant Fe oxide phases, which may be important to the fate and transport of 60Co in contaminated environments.</field><field name="date">2009-07-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05062009-120031/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sacramental Conversation: The Poetry of Coleridge and Hopkins</field><field name="creator">Morris, Gabriel Stephen</field><field name="description">While much scholarship has considered the theological and metaphysical foundations of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#161;&#175;s and Gerard Manley Hopkins&#161;&#175; poetry, this study seeks to add to the conversation by examining how a conversational mode of meditation unique to Christian sacrament inspires that poetry. Both Coleridge and Hopkins demonstrate an understanding of Christian sacrament that emphasizes engagement and encounter with God through language and creation; in turn, they create a poetry that uses all aspects of the form -- musical sound yoked to philosophical sense -- to record and reenact this sacramental encounter. Chapter 1 discusses how Coleridge, beginning from the Idealism of George Berkeley, counters Berkeley&#161;&#175;s passive, non-sacramental reading of nature with a theory of active engagement with nature, man, and God. We see how this theory issues in the &#161;&#176;conversation poems,&#161;&#177; a set of meditations that enact the sacramental interchange that results from the poet&#161;&#175;s awareness of God&#161;&#175;s presence in the fullness of creation. Chapter 2 considers how Hopkins steps beyond the subtle machinations of Scotist theology to the meditative engagement of Ignatius Loyola&#161;&#175;s Spiritual Exercises. Encouraged by Ignatius&#161;&#175; emphasis on detail and particularity, Hopkins creates a poetic practice that uses the music of words to their fullest sacramental potential, demonstrating in poetry how man encounters God through active engagement with the world and takes on the image of Christ through sacrament.</field><field name="date">2004-05-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05072004-104238/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The systemic response to fire damage in tomato plants: A case study in the development of methods for gene expression analysis using sequence data</field><field name="creator">Coker, Jeffrey Scott</field><field name="description">Fire is a natural component of most terrestrial ecosystems and can act as a local wound stimulus to plants. The ultimate goal of this work was to characterize the array of transcripts which systemically accumulate in plants after fire damage. Before this could be accomplished, substantial development of methods for gene expression analysis using sequence data was necessary. This involved developing methods for identifying contamination in DNA sequence data (Chapter 2), identifying over 78,000 false sequences in GenBank and several thousand more in the indica rice genome (Chapter 2), developing a novel method for identifying housekeeping controls using sequence data (Chapter 3), performing relative expression analyses for 127 potential housekeeping control transcripts (Chapter 3), and characterizing 23 transcripts which encode all 13 subunits of vacuolar H+-ATPases in tomato plants (Chapter 4). A subtractive cDNA library served as a starting point to identify and characterize 9 novel tomato transcripts systemically up-regulated in leaves in the first hour after a distant leaf is flame wounded (Chapters 5). Real-time RT-PCR using leaf RNA isolated at different times after flaming showed that the most common pattern of transcript accumulation was an increase within 30 to 60 minutes, followed by a return to basal levels within 3 hours. Expression analyses also showed that most up-regulated transcripts were already present in unwounded tissues. A total of 46 different transcripts were identified from the subtractive cDNA library (Chapters 6). Compared with the entire tomato transcriptome, these 46 transcripts are very highly conserved in plants. The vast majority fell into 5 classes: enzymes of general metabolism; protein synthesis, modification, and transport; transcription; membrane transport; and photosynthesis and respiration. At least half of the transcripts have been previously associated with wounding or stress, suggesting that the systemic response to fire damage has components similar to those of other wound and stress responses. On the other hand, 30% of transcripts were associated with photosynthesis and respiration, suggesting that part of the response to fire damage is notably different from other wound and stress responses.

This research involves: an assessment of productivity measures with the goal of determining which resource category are key areas to monitor after merger activity, an evaluation of profitable textile mergers with the goal of delineating the execution of the merger strategies, an analysis of the effect of increased outsourcing on productivity growth with respect to the textile industry, and an evaluation of the adequacy of productivity measures in representing the economic competitiveness of the US Textile Industry. For the sample of textile companies, merger activity impacts the productivity of capital and knowledge resources the most. The most common strategies employed during successful textile mergers targeted the improvement of: corporate structure, product differentiation and speed to market. The influence of outsourcing on productivity growth in the textile industry was found to be negligible when comparing productivity measures that include and exclude outsourcing. In order to get a better understanding of competitiveness, companies are not looking solely at productivity, but are pairing productivity with other measures mainly profitability measures. Of all the resource categories, the productivity of knowledge resources is the leading contributor to competitiveness. However, one difficulty is that knowledge resources are also the category for which there were not concrete measures productivity that denote how well this resource was being used.</field><field name="date">2007-05-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05072007-091242/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Religion, Spirituality, and Popular Culture: Where College Students Learn About Religion and Spirituality</field><field name="creator">Ofstein, Jennifer Beth</field><field name="description">This study aims to assess if students are learning about religion and spirituality from popular culture, and if it subsequently affects their understanding of their own religious or spiritual identity, or the religious and spiritual identities of others.

Currently, the application rate of swine lagoon liquid is based on the N concentration of the lagoon liqu id and the N required by the receiver crop to obtain a realistic yield. In North Carolina, only 50% of the total N in the swine lagoon liquid applied by irrigation is considered available for plant use during the first year after application. Uncertaint y exists as to whether this coefficient accurately predicts the amount of plant-available N. Therefore, research was conducted in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina to determine the efficiency of N uptake by corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max M errill) receiving swine lagoon liquid through irrigation. The line-source sprinkler irrigation method was used to provide a continuous variable N rate, ranging from 0 to 290 kg N/ha, across the field during 1999 and 2000. Ammonia volatilization losses r anged from 6 to 22% during irrigation. Crop yield and grain N recovered were affected more by the amount of liquid than N applied in 1999. Nitrogen recovered in grain in 1999 was &lt;15% for both corn and soybean at 168 kg N/ha of either swine lagoon liqui d or ammonium nitrate. In 2000 at the 168 kg N/ha rate, grain N removal by corn, nonnodulating soybean, and nodulating soybean was 28, 25, and 39% from swine lagoon liquid and 45, 31, and 56% from ammonium nitrate. Based on yields and grain N removed by corn and nonnodulating soybean in 2000, N from applied swine lagoon liquid, accounting for N losses during irrigation, was about 70% as effective as ammonium nitrate. Symbiotic N2 fixation by the soybean was reduced by 60% when applied N reached 175 kg N/ha for both ammonium nitrate and swine lagoon liquid. While nodulating soybean removed more grain N than did either corn or nonnodulating soybean in 2000, soil inorganic N concentrations at the end of the growing season were higher for the nodulating s oybean. Therefore, it is not conclusive if soybean would be a better receiver crop than corn for swine lagoon liquid. Based on the results of this study, using the 50% available N coefficient of the lagoon liquid comes close to predicting plant-availabl e N when N losses during irrigation are around 25%. Nitrogen losses during irrigation can significantly affect plant-available N when applied N is based on the N concentrations of the lagoon liquid.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-125033/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE EFFECTS OF PM2.5 ON ALLERGIC INFLAMMATION IN MAST CELL DEFICIENT MICE</field><field name="creator">Madison, Sharon L.</field><field name="description">MADISON, SHARON LYNN. The effects of PM2.5 on allergic inflammation in mast cell deficient mice. (Under the direction of Bruce Hammerberg.) Animal models of asthma have confirmed epidemiological findings that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can enhance asthmatic symptoms, including eosinophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Critics have dismissed the possibility that these studies utilizing artificial exposure scenarios, like intratracheal instillation (i.t.), can be legitimately extrapolated to human risk largely due to the fact that the doses required for this type of model exceed the normal ambient concentrations of PM2.5. In order to improve the credibility of the findings from previous animal studies utilizing the i.t. method for delivery of aqueous particle suspensions to the lung, and to determine the biological mechanisms responsible for the observed enhancement of allergic inflammation following PM2.5 exposure, large-scale air samplers have been developed making it possible to directly expose wild type (WT) and genetically altered mice to fine, concentrated ambient particles (CAPs). In this study allergic asthma was modeled in both WT and mast cell deficient (MCD) mice by local (L) or systemic (S) sensitization to ovalbumin (OVA). Two weeks later mice were challenged with OVA (day 0) and then exposed to CAPs (day 0 &amp; 1) with numerous endpoints collected (day 0-2). Overall, there was a temporal difference in the bronchoalveolar lavage cell profile between L and S sensitized mice, and the contribution of mast cells (MC) to this differential response was best observed for neutrophils at day 0 and day 1. Compared to air exposed mice, CAPs depressed total inflammatory cell infiltrates in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid at day 0 and day 1 after OVA challenge for all groups. This overwhelming difference of limited cellular infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid following CAPs exposure, and the significant difference between the L and S sensitization protocols, confound interpretation for all of the factors examined. However, the specific finding that CAPs can enhance eosinophil recruitment by day 2 after OVA challenge indicates that the results from previous animal studies utilizing i.t. PM2.5 exposures do in fact support the epidemiological associations linking PM2.5 exposures with the enhancement of allergic inflammation indicative of the asthmatic phenotype. Given the strict regulation of immunological tolerance at mucosal surfaces like the lung, the genetic variability of different mouse strains, and the daily changes in ambient PM2.5 composition, the findings of this study prompt many unique questions. However, the bottom line is that this study demonstrates that ambient PM2.5 does alter Th2-like responses in mice by enhancing pulmonary BAL eosinophils in the late phase response (day 2), and that mast cells are critical to their recruitment.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-132938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fruit neighborhoods and interactions between birds and plants in Puerto Rico</field><field name="creator">Saracco, James Frederick</field><field name="description">Many species of plants that produce fleshy fruits depend on birds for seed dispersal, and many of the birds that disperse seeds rely on fruits for a substantial proportion of their diets. From an ecological and evolutionary standpoint, it is important to understand why frugivorous birds feed in the particular plants they do. Intrinsic plant characteristics (e.g., crop size) influence the foraging patterns of birds; however, these factors cannot be fully understood outside the context of the communities within which birds and plants find themselves. Here I report on spatial patterns of bird use of fruiting plants in central Puerto Rico and its relationship to plant distributions and fruit abundance. From Feb.-Jun. 1998 I quantified frugivorous bird visitation to fruiting trees of Schefflera morototoni in a secondary forest-shade coffee plantation mosaic. Visitation rate was positively related to crop size and negatively related to conspecific fruit abundance within 30 m of focal plants. The presence or abundance of heterospecific bird-consumed fruits had mixed relationships with visitation: four species were positively related to visitation; one was negatively related. The fruit neighborhood explained most variation in visitation to focal trees, suggesting that such variables might help explain the high variability seen in other fruiting plant frugivore systems. In order to evaluate spatial dependency in tree distributions, fruiting, and frugivory over a range of tree species and spatial scales, I mapped bird-consumed fruiting plants on a 4.05 ha study grid in secondary wet forest and monitored fruiting and frugivory from Aug.-Nov. 1999. I focused analyses on four tree species: Dendropanax arboreus, Guarea guidonia, Miconia serrulata, and Schefflera morototoni. All of these were intraspecifically aggregated at scales &lt; 80 m, but differed markedly in degree of crowding experienced by individuals. G. guidonia was the most, and M. serrulata the least crowded. Distributions of visited trees and autocorrelation in the number of frugivory observations at trees suggested that individuals of some species (e.g., S. morototoni) facilitated visitation to one another at small spatial scales (&lt; ~30 m). Frugivory was positively correlated with fruit abundance on trees for all species; spatial variation in fruit abundance appeared to have reduced, and in some cases outweighed (e.g., M. serrulata), facilitative benefits of visited neighbors. Evidence of facilitation was especially weak for G. guidonia and may have reflected its particularly high density in the study area. Consideration of interspecific tree distributions showed S. morototoni to be aggregated with M. serrulata at scales &gt; 69 m, and G. guidonia to be aggregated with D. arboreus at scales &lt; 5 m. All other pairs were randomly or regularly distributed with respect to one another. Spatial patterns of fruiting and frugivory of M. serrulata appeared linked to the distribution of fruiting S. morototoni. Spatial patterns of frugivory also overlapped for other species and generally suggested facilitation at larger scales. Interspecific interactions were probably strongest at larger scales because of shifts in the relative abundances of conspecifics and heterospecifics at those scales. These findings highlight the potentially large size of plant neighborhoods with respect to use by avian frugivores and the dependence of neighborhood effects on local plant densities and crop sizes. From the perspective of birds, spatial patterns of frugivory suggested birds closely tracked fruit abundance. I observed few agonistic interactions between birds and found little evidence of their negatively influencing one another?s use of fruiting trees. Similarity in spatial patterns of frugivory between bird species, and positive cross-correlation in frugivory of different species at patch boundaries, suggested birds may have assisted one another (via calling) in locating new foraging patches. This could explain mixed-species flock formation.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-160516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of a spark ignition flame kernel interacting with a laminar vortex toroid</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Yin</field><field name="description">Chemistry-turbulence interactions play a critical role in most practical combustion environments. Understanding the interaction between a flame kernel and a vortex is an important fundamental step. This dissertation presents high-speed movies of combustion luminosity during the interaction of a laminar vortex toroid with a spark -generated premixed flame kernel in a quiescent combustion chamber. The resulting time evolution of the perturbed flame kernel shows that laminar vortices of various sizes and vortex strengths can increase the kernel growth rate by at least a factor of 3 and significantly increase combustion reaction rates by involving additional highly curved and stretched flame fronts. This dissertation also describes experiments that were conducted to study the Lewis number effect on the flame kernel-vortex interaction. The influence of a time varying strain rate on kernel growth was investigated by studying both lean methane-air (thermo-diffusively unstable) and lean propane-air (thermo-diffusively stable) flame kernels, using both natural CH/OH emission image sequences acquired by a high-speed intensified camera to show details of the disturbed flame kernel growth, and OH-PLIF images to determine the true two-dimensional nature of the interaction. Significant differences are observed in the highly curved regions on the backside of the invading vortex in the two different mixtures. Lewis number effects on local burning rate variations, flame front wrinkling, and pocket formation are reported, and in general, the results are in agreement with predictions from asymptotic theory assuming low stretch rates. Local mixture enrichment by direct injection in the vicinity of the spark plug at the time of ignition can affect flame kernel development and extend the lean limit of flammability of a fuel/air mixture. In the third set of the experiments, flame kernels were ignited in a lean premixed CH4/air mixture with an equivalence ratio of 0.6, while CH4/air mixtures at six different equivalence ratios ranging from 0 to infinity were used to generate the vortex. Chemiluminescence images of kernel -vortex interactions have been captured using both anICCD camera and a high-speed intensified camera. Details about flame kernel-vortex interactions of the six test cases are presented and discussed by comparing image sequences for different cases.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-161250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INDUCTIVELY COUPLED PLASMA ETCHING OF III-N SEMICONDUCTORS</field><field name="creator">Smith, Scott Alan</field><field name="description">The principal focus of this research was the employment of an in-house designed and constructed inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system for integrated studies pertaining to the etching rates and etching selectivity among AlN, GaN, and Al(x)Ga(1-x)N. An (ICP) system was chosen because of its high plasma density and low cost relative to other high-density plasma etching systems. The etch rates were studied as a function of ICP power, pressure, DC bias, and gas composition. The use of a mixture of 2 sccm BCl3 and 18 sccm Cl2 resulted in a maximum etch rate of 2.2 microns/min for GaN as well as nearly vertical sidewalls with proper masking. A selectivity value, i.e. the ratio of the etch rates between two materials, as high as 48 was achieved between GaN and AlN with the addition of low concentrations of O2 to a Cl2/Ar chemistry. The use of another selectivity technique, namely, low DC biases resulted in a maximum selectivity of 38. The mechanisms responsible for the GaN etching were determined by monitoring both the ion density with a Langmuir probe and the relative Cl radical density with an optical emission spectrometer. Increasing the ion density resulted in a non-linear increase in the etch rates; increasing the Cl radical density had a minim al affect on etch rate.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-162142/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ru-based Gate Electrodes for Advanced Dual-Metal Gate CMOS Devices</field><field name="creator">Zhong, Huicai</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to search for proper metallic gate electrodes for CMOS devices. The most important criteria for an alternative metal gate electrode are (a) appropriate work function for NMOS or PMOS (b) excellent thermal/chemical stability under high temperature (c) low resistivity and high active electrical concentration and (d) feasibility for integration. This dissertation covers the following research areas. The properties of reactive sputtering deposited Ru and RuO2 films were systematically studied. Techniques such as XRD, AFM, XPS and TEM were used to characterize the films. High temperature stability was observed for both Ru and RuO2 films on SiO2 and ZrO2. The films also exhibited low stress, good oxygen barrier properties and were easy to dry etch. Electrical properties were evaluated on MOS capacitors with SiO2 and high-K dielectrics including ZrO2, Al2O3, and Y2O3. Excellent stability of oxide thickness and flatband voltage was observed for SiO2 dielectric capacitors. For capacitors with high-K dielectrics, equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) change and flatband voltage shift as a function of annealing temperature were observed. This was attributed to excess oxygen in the high-K dielectrics that was causing the oxidation of the Si substrate. Next, Ru-Ta alloy films prepared by reactive sputtering were evaluated as gate electrode materials. The alloy film resistivities had a strong dependence on film composition and annealing temperature. XRD and XPS measurements were used to evaluate the phases for alloy films. Ru1Ta1 phase was formed in alloy film with at. % Ta between 40% and 60%. Excellent thermal stability of alloy films with Ta at.% &lt; 60% was observed up to RTA anneal temperatures of 1000C. A non-linear relationship between work function and Ru-Ta alloy composition was measured. The values ranged from 4.2eV to 5eV, making it possible for this alloy to be used as gate electrode for both N- and P-MOSFET device. Finally, NMOSFETs and PMOSFETs using the best gate electrodes, namely, Ru-Ta alloy for NMOS and Ru for PMOS, were fabricated using SiO2 as the gate dielectric. A comprehensive analysis of device performance was made with metal gate electrodes and poly-Silicon controls. Excellent hole mobility for Ru gate P-MOSFET was observed. The mobility of N-MOSFETs with Ru-Ta alloys gate electrode were found to be slightly lower than the universal curve and this was attributed to the presence of interface states arising from the sputtering process. This suggests the need for optimizing the deposition process. In conclusion, Ru-based alloys were evaluated as gate electrodes and were found to exhibit desirable properties to be considered as proper candidates for CMOS devices.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-162921/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of Calcium Binding Peptide Derived from Calreticulin and Its Effect on Increasing Bioavailable Calcium in Plants</field><field name="creator">Tsou, Pei-Lan</field><field name="description">Modulation of cytosolic calcium levels in both plants and animals is achieved by a system of Ca2+ -transport and storage pathways that include Ca2+ buffering proteins in the lumen of intracellular compartments. We used a transgenic approach to modulate calcium stores in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in plants. We were able to use the low affinity, high capacity Ca2+ binding characteristics of the C-domain of calreticulin (CRT) to selectively increase Ca2+ storage in the endoplasmic reticulum, and to determine if those alterations affected plant physiological responses to stress. I fused the CRT C-domain to the C-terminal portion of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and obtained transgenic plants that expressed high levels of the GFP-CRT C-domain fusion protein in the ER. I showed that this fusion protein was able to bind Ca2+ in vitro. These plants had increased Ca2+ stores in the ER and the ER calcium stores were used by the plant in times of calcium stress. The transformed seedlings also showed delayed loss of chlorophyll after transfer to high salt medium. The data suggest that expression of this calcium binding protein not only has the ability to increase bioavailable calcium stores but that the ER Ca2+ stores are important for plants to relieve the effect of salt stress. In the process of developing the transgenic plants, I also developed an array of other tools for subcellular localization, and targeting of the C-domain to various subcellular organelles. With two other colleagues, we also developed a GFP imaging system using the onion epidermal cells for visualizing subcellular localization of GFP and GFP fusion proteins.</field><field name="date">2002-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082002-163334/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GaN-dielectric interface formation for gate dielectrics and passivation layers using remote plasma processing</field><field name="creator">Bae, Choelhwyi</field><field name="description">In previous studies, device quality Si-SiO2 interfaces and dielectric bulk films (SiO2) were prepared using a two-step process; i) remote plasma-assisted oxidation (RPAO) to form a superficially interfacial oxide (~0.6 nm) and ii) remote plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RPECVD) to deposit the oxide film. The same approach has been applied to the GaN-SiO2 system. After a 300 oC remote N2/He plasma treatment of the GaN surface, residual C and Cl were reduced below Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) detection, and the AES peak ratio of O KLL and N KLL was ~0.06 or ~0.1 monolayer of oxygen. RPAO of GaN surfaces using O2, N2O, and N2O in N2 source gases were investigated by on-line AES to determine the oxidation kinetics and chemical composition of the interfacial oxide. Without an RPAO step, subcutaneous oxidation of GaN takes place during RPECVD deposition of SiO2, and on-line AES indicates a ~0.6-0.8 nm subcutaneous oxide. Compared to single step SiO2 deposition, significantly reduced interface state density (Dit) was obtained at the GaN-SiO2 interface by independent control of GaN-Ga2O3 interface formation by thin RPAO oxide (~1 nm) and SiO2 film deposition by RPECVD. High-low frequency method and conductance method indicate that Dit of GaN Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) sample without RPAO is ~5 times larger than that of the sample with RPAO. For the GaN MOS structure with remote plasma oxidation and nitridation, Dit determined at DCmax was low-to-mid x 1011 cm-2eV-1. Also, we report on high temperature and photo-assisted capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics.</field><field name="date">2003-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082003-023332/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooling Tower Fan Control for Energy Efficiency</field><field name="creator">Stout, Malcolm Russell Jr.</field><field name="description">This thesis evaluates the economics of alternative cooling tower capacity control methods. Annual fan electrical energy requirements are calculated for towers with single-speed, two-speed, and variable-speed fans. Fan energy requirements are determined for counter-flow and cross-flow towers designed for low initial cost and for energy efficiency. Effectiveness-NTU equations are solved to predict cooling tower performance at various fan speeds. Natural convection, which determines the cooling capacity when the fan is off, is accounted for using a mean enthalpy difference. Ambient conditions are simulated using typical meteorological year data for five locations. The results show that potential savings are not strongly dependent on the approach temperature, but do increase with increasing range in colder climates. The potential for saving is greatest for cooling towers designed for low initial cost, and is generally higher in locations where the wet-bulb temperature remains relatively constant throughout the year. Two-speed fans that can operate at half speed are generally more suitable for low-cost cooling towers. Two-speed fans that can operate at two-third speed are better for towers designed for energy efficiency and are generally better when the range exceeds 10 F.</field><field name="date">2003-05-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082003-122724/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic modeling of transcription factor binding fluctuations</field><field name="creator">Pirone, Jason R</field><field name="description">Cell populations typically exhibit binary or graded transcriptional responses to external stimuli. Transcription factor interactions with DNA have been hypothesized to account for both of these scenarios. To address this hypothesis, two stochastic models were constructed to describe transcription in simple, engineered eukaryotic systems. In the first system, three transcription factors bind independently to enhancer sites directing production of protein. This system has no regulation in the form of feedback loops, but the system nonetheless exhibits a clear binary response when transcription factor binding fluctuations are slow. The graded response occurs when transcription factor binding fluctuations are rapid. Thus, transcription factor binding fluctuation is an important mechanism underlying and reconciling the graded and binary transcriptional responses. In the second model, the influence of autoregulatory feedback loops on transcription was assessed. Autoregulated systems are capable of exhibiting bistability, a mechanism cited to explain the binary transcriptional response. In this autoregulated system, a dimeric protein acts as a transcription factor to increase its own production. Using biologically realistic parameter values, the system was determined not to be bistable. However, binary transcriptional responses were still observed in stochastic models due to discrete fluctuations in transcription factor binding. The results of both models suggest that transcription factor binding fluctuations play an important, and often overlooked role, in observed patterns of transcriptional activation.</field><field name="date">2004-05-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082004-200902/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of Enteric Bacteria in Swine Feces Before and After Lagoon Treatment</field><field name="creator">Qian, Leilei</field><field name="description">Antibiotics are used in livestock production for the treatment of diseases and for improvement of feed efficiency and growth. However, agricultural use of antibiotics may be partly responsible for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Large amounts of managed manure are land applied, which opens the door for the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Thus, the goal of this project was to evaluate the effects of lagoon treatment on the persistence of antibiotic resistant enteric bacteria isolated from swine feces. Both cool season and warm season samples were collected from a swine farm located in Sampson County, NC. Each season samples included three nursery swine fecal samples, three nursery swine lagoon liquid samples, four finishing swine fecal samples, three finishing swine lagoon liquid samples, and four soil samples from both nursery and finishing swine spray field. A total of 4032 E. coli isolates and 4896 Enterococcus isolates were obtained from the samples. The antibiotic resistance profiles of the isolates were determined using a set of antibiotics at various concentrations. The antibiotic cephalothin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, tetracycline, streptomycin, and neomycin were tested for both bacterial species, but different concentrations were applied. For E. coli, rifampicin was also tested; for Enterococcus, chlortetracycline, vancomycin, and amoxicillin were also tested. After antibiotic resistance analysis was achieved, 25 isolates were randomly selected from each sample for further evaluation by polymerase chain reaction test. Soil samples were collected; however, fecal indicator bacteria were not recovered. Additionally, E. coli was not recovered from warm season nursery lagoon samples. All isolates displayed multiple antibiotic resistance, and for the isolates from the same source, the resistance patterns were similar for the antibiotics within the same antibiotic family. Percentages of resistant isolates were greater in nursery fecal samples than in finishing fecal samples for majority of antibiotic tests. For nursery samples, percentages of antibiotic resistant isolates decreased after lagoon treatment for majority of antibiotic tests. For finishing samples, no such trend was obvious. The results indicated that antibiotic resistant isolates still persist in the lagoon liquid, which may cause potential risk to human and environmental health. And because antibiotic resistance may affect later therapeutic and subtherapeutic value of these antibiotics, management strategies of agricultural antibiotic use may be improved. The antibiotic resistance patterns and molecular banding patterns of the isolates were not unique to a specific source. The results suggest that there is considerable overlap among nursery feces, nursery lagoon, finishing feces and finishing lagoon samples. However, if combine of the feces and the lagoon isolates together and only classify isolates from nursery to finishing swine, the percentages of correctly classified isolates became larger. The results suggest that ARA and PCR would best be used for identifying fecal contamination from swine sources based on broad categories (nursery versus finishing) instead of relying on these procedures for specific identification of lagoon and feces separately.</field><field name="date">2007-06-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082007-161836/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network Resource Scheduling and Management of Optical Grids</field><field name="creator">Tanwir, Savera</field><field name="description">Advance reservation of lightpaths in an optical network has become a popular concept of reserving network resources in support of Grid applications. In this thesis, we have evaluated and compared several algorithms for dynamic scheduling of lightpaths using a flexible advance reservation model. The main aim is to find the best scheduling policy that improves network utilization and minimizes blocking. The scheduling of lightpaths involve both routing and wavelength assignment. Our simulation results show that minimum cost adaptive routing where link costs are determined by the current and future usage of the link provides the minimum blocking. Moreover, searching for k alternate paths within the scheduling window significantly improves the performance. For wavelength assignment, we have used a scheme that reduces fragmentation by minimizing unused leading or trailing gaps. We have also analyzed approaches for failure recovery and lightpath re-optimization. Finally, an advance reservation scheme needs timely information regarding the status of the optical links. To this end, we have surveyed various monitoring tools and techniques and we have proposed a monitoring framework to support fast restoration.</field><field name="date">2007-05-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Networking</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082007-194445/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the Efficiency of Tests and Estimators of Treatment Effect with Auxiliary Covariates in the Presence of Censoring</field><field name="creator">Lu, Xiaomin</field><field name="description">In most randomized clinical trials, the primary response variable, for example, the survival time, is not observed directly after the patients enroll in the study but rather observed after some period of time (lag time). It is often the case that such a response variable is missing for some patients because of censoring such as administrative censoring that occurs when the study ends before all the patients had the opportunity to observe their response but also censoring may result from patient dropout. It is often assumed that censoring occurs at random which is referred to as noninformative censoring; however, in many cases such an assumption may not be reasonable. If the missing data are not analyzed properly, the estimate or test for the treatment effect may be biased. In this paper, we considered two situations. In the first situation, we only consider the special case where the censoring time is noninformative and the survival time itself the time-lagged response. We use semiparametric theory to derive a class of consistent and asymptotically normal estimators for the unconditional log-hazard ratio parameter. The prognostic auxiliary covariates are used to derive estimators that are more efficient than the traditional maximum partial likelihood estimator and the corresponding Wald tests are more powerful than the logrank test. In the second situation, we extended the results under the first situation to a general case where the censoring time can be informative and the time-lagged response can be any type. We also use the semiparametric theory to derive a class of consistent and asymptotic estimator for the treatment effect estimator. The prognostic baseline auxiliary covariates and post-treatment auxiliary covariates, which may be time-dependent, are also used to derive estimators that both account for informative censoring and are more efficient then the estimators which do not consider the auxiliary covariates.</field><field name="date">2007-05-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05082007-235129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service Sector Growth and Income Inequalities: A Longitudinal Analysis from an International Sample</field><field name="creator">Rizk, Stephanie Carissa</field><field name="description">The rise of the service sector has been offered as a possible reason for rising income inequalities in highly developed countries.

Results of random effects models show that 1)service sector growth has a positive relationship with income inequality, 2) that level of development has a strong positive relationship with income inequality, and 3) that redistribution efforts have had little impact on income inequality over time. Some support is given to the idea that there is an interaction effect between service sector growth and relative placement within the overall world system. This raises the question of whether service sector growth affects the income inequality of a nation differently based on where they are ranked in the hierarchy of world development.</field><field name="date">2003-05-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092003-124333/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MORPHOLOGICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF CARBON NANOTUBE/POLYMER COMPOSITES VIA MELT COMPOUNDING</field><field name="creator">Dondero, William Edward</field><field name="description">The mechanical properties and morphology of multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT)/polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites were studied as a function of nanotube orientation and concentration. Through melt mixing followed by melt drawing, using a twin screw mini-extruder with a specially designed winding apparatus, the dispersion and orientation of multi-wall carbon nanotubes was optimized in polypropylene. Tensile tests showed a 32% increase in toughness for a 0.25 wt % MWNT in PP (over pure PP). Moreover, modulus increased by 138% with 0.25 wt % MWNTs. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) all demonstrated qualitative nanotube orientation. Wide angle X-ray diffraction was used to calculate the Herman?s Orientation Factor for the composites as function of nanotube loading and orientation. No significant changes in PP crystal orientation were found indicating that the alignment of the nanotubes did not significantly affect the orientation of the PP crystals. In addition, differential scanning caloriometry (DSC) qualitatively revealed little change in overall crystallinity. In conclusion this work has shown that melt mixing coupled with melt drawing has yielded MWNT/PP composites with a unique combination of strength and toughness suitable for advanced fiber applications, such as smart fibers and high performance fabrics.</field><field name="date">2005-07-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092005-110617/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exact and Heuristic Methods for solving the View-Selection Problem for Aggregate Queries</field><field name="creator">Asgharzadeh Talebi, Zohreh</field><field name="description">In this thesis we present a formal study of the following view-selection problem: Given a set of queries, a database, and an upper bound on the amount of disk space that can be used to store materialized views, return definitions of views that, when materialized in the database, would reduce the evaluation costs of the queries. Optimizing the layout of stored data using view selection has a direct impact on the performance of the entire database system. At the same time, the optimization problem is intractable, even under natural restrictions on the types of queries of interest. We introduce an integer-programming model to obtain optimal solutions for the view-selection problem for aggregate queries on data warehouses. Through a computational experiment we show that this model can be used to solve realistic-size instances of the problem. We also report the results of the post-optimality analysis that we performed to determine the impact of changing certain input characteristics on the optimal solution. We solve large instances by applying several methods of reducing the size of the search space. We compare our approach to the leading heuristic procedure in the field [20].</field><field name="date">2006-06-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092006-123513/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphorus dissolution in soil material from a Carolina bay as affected by reducing conditions</field><field name="creator">Brownfield, Christopher Scott</field><field name="description">The restoration of drained agricultural soils to wetlands may result in the dissolution of P from reduced soils, causing the eutrophication of nearby surface waters. Therefore, continued improvements in the ability to predict P dissolution are necessary to minimize its potential environmental hazard. The objectives of this project were to determine if P dissolution would occur when soil material from a drained Carolina bay wetland was reduced, and to hypothesize explanations of differences in P dissolution between soils based on aqueous solution chemistry. Suspensions (15 g kg-1) of &lt; 53 &#956;m separates from surface samples (0-10 cm) of six poorly drained soils were subjected to microbial reduction for 25 d in a continuously stirred reactor. In a separate experiment, saturated whole soil samples (2.5 g H2O g-1 solids) were incubated under O2-free conditions for 62 d. In addition to total P, Fe, Mn, and Al; dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP), Fe(II), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were measured in filtrate samples from both experiments. A net increase in P dissolution (two-fold increase, up to 1.2 mg L-1) was observed for only one of six suspensions (Ponzer 1) in the continuously stirred reactor experiment. In that suspension the molar P:Fe(II) suggested that reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-bound P could not fully account for the P that dissolved, and DOC was highly correlated with P dissolution. For reactor suspensions in which no net P dissolution occurred, oxalate-extractable Al was negatively correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with final [DRP], and DOC concentrations were approximately 2-fold lower than in the Ponzer 1 suspension. In the static incubation experiment, P dissolution occurred in all four samples, and the highest concentration was seen in the Ponzer 1 sample (three-fold increase, up to 2.2 mg DRP L-1). Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were between 2 and 4 fold higher in the static incubation experiment than the highest concentration observed in the stirred reactor experiment, and offer a qualitative explanation for the additional P dissolution that occurred in static incubation experiment. The results of these experiments suggest that P concentrations in soils of the restored wetland will increase upon reduction to levels that are environmentally threatening, and that interaction of DOC with PO4 or minerals that bind PO4 plays an important role in the release of P.</field><field name="date">2007-08-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092007-122444/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supper on the Trail: How Food and Provisions Shaped Nineteenth-Century Westward Migration</field><field name="creator">Gray, Andrea Rebecca</field><field name="description">Between the late 1830s and the 1860s, over 350,000 men, women, and children traveled overland along the Oregon and California Trails to the American West. Using primary sources including narratives, diaries, journals, reports, and letters, one discovers that obtaining food was perhaps the most critical concern for westward migrants. That overlanders and their animals had to eat is nothing new or alarming, but their need for food did carry many unexpected implications. Food connected migrants to the land, and in turn the land connected people to each other through competition over resources such as water, grass, and timber. Through their primary role as cooks, women&#226;s experiences of the trail centered around the preparation of food. Native Americans and white migrants interacted peaceably by sharing or trading food, while competition over natural resources at the same time strained relations and devastated many western tribes whose land was ravaged by the train of migrants. Food influenced the timing and routes of travel, the health and mood of travelers, and the economic and physical status of settlers upon arrival in the West. The overlanders&#226; need for nourishment serves as the framework for understanding how provisions helped determine the overall experience of westward travel and reveals that food shaped mid-nineteenth-century westward migration.</field><field name="date">2008-05-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092008-134048/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microwave Sintering of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Materials</field><field name="creator">Kapoor, Abhishek Surinder</field><field name="description">The influence of sintering temperature and hold time on the microstructure of of a microwave sintered LSM-YSZ (lanthanum strontium manganate - yttria stabilized zirconia) cathode has been studied. For experimental purposes, a microwave furnace was designed and fabricated with a closed loop temperature feedback control system. A type R thermocouple was used to provide accurate temperature readings inside the microwave cavity. An Allen Bradley Micrologix PLC was used to control the system. This furnace was used as a test bed for experiments involving the rapid sintering of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) materials. The SOFC specimens were made by depositing LSM-YSZ cathode material onto YSZ-8 electrolyte buttons. The specimens were sintered for a variety of temperatures and hold times. The microstructure obtained through microwave sintering showed equal or better pore size distribution as compared to those obtained through conventional sintering. The sintered structure was found to be less dense and to contain smaller pores as the sintering temperature was reduced to 1100&#203;C or lower. Rapid sintering of SOFC materials has potential advantages in terms of SOFC performance and offers potential energy savings when compared with conventional sintering. This research has demonstrated the feasibility of rapid sintering of porous SOFC materials. The next step is to optimize the microwave sintering schedule with respect to the electrical performance and the long term stability of the SOFC.</field><field name="date">2008-05-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092008-144010/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insider Threat: User Identification Via Process Profiling</field><field name="creator">McKinney, Steven</field><field name="description">The issue of insider threat is one that organizations have dealt with for many years. Insider threat research began in the early 80's, but has yet to provide satisfactory results despite the fact that insiders pose a greater threat to organizations than external attackers. One of the key issues relating to this problem is that the amount of collectable data is enormous and it is currently impossible to analyze all of it, for each insider, in a timely manner. The purpose of this research is to analyze a portion of this collectable data, process usage, and determine if this data is useful in identifying insiders. Identification of the person controlling the workstation is useful in environments where workstations are left unattended, even for a short amount of time. To do this, we developed an insider threat detection system based on the Naive Bayes method which examines process usage data and creates individual profiles for users. By comparing collected data to these profiles we are able to determine who is controlling the workstation with high accuracy. We are able to achieve true positive rates of 96\% while maintaining fewer than 0.5\% false positives.</field><field name="date">2008-05-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Networking</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092008-154325/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlling Sub-Microdomain Structure in Microphase-Ordered Block Copolymers and Their Nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Bowman, Michelle Kathleen</field><field name="description">Block copolymers exhibit a wealth of morphologies that continue to find ubiquitous use in a diverse variety of mature and emergent (nano)technologies, such as photonic crystals, integrated circuits, pharmaceutical encapsulents, fuel cells and separation membranes. While numerous studies have explored the effects of molecular confinement on such copolymers, relatively few have examined the sub-microdomain structure that develops upon modification of copolymer molecular architecture or physical incorporation of nanoscale objects. This work will address two relevant topics in this vein: (i) bidisperse brushes formed by single block copolymer molecules and (ii) copolymer nanocomposites formed by addition of molecular or nanoscale additives. In the first case, an isomorphic series of asymmetric poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene) (S1IS2) triblock copolymers of systematically varied chain length has been synthesized from a parent SI diblock copolymer. Small-angle x-ray scattering, coupled with dynamic rheology and self-consistent field theory (SCFT), reveals that the progressively grown S2 block initially resides in the I-rich matrix and effectively reduces the copolymer incompatibility until a critical length is reached. At this length, the S2 block co-locates with the S1 block so that the two blocks generate a bidisperse brush (insofar as the S1 and S2 lengths differ). This single-molecule analog to binary block copolymer blends affords unique opportunities for materials design at sub-microdomain length scales and provides insight into the transition from diblock to triblock copolymer (and thermoplastic elastomeric nature). In the second case, I explore the distribution of molecular and nanoscale additives in microphase-ordered block copolymers and demonstrate via SCFT that an interfacial excess, which depends strongly on additive concentration, selectivity and relative size, develops. These predictions are in agreement with experimental findings. Moreover, using a poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate) (SM) diblock copolymer with an order-disorder transition temperature (TODT) of 186&#194;&#176;C, we find that the addition of clustered and discrete nanoparticles of varying size and surface selectivity can cause TODT to generally decrease, but occasionally increase. Also experimenting with a poly(styrene-b-isoprene) (SI) diblock copolymer with an TODT of 116&#194;&#176;C, we find that the addition of smaller nanoparticles at small volume fractions effect the TODT more profoundly. The latter unexpected results are likewise predicted by SCFT and provide a unique strategy by which to improve the nanostructure stability of block copolymers by physical means.</field><field name="date">2008-08-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05092008-155151/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity is in the Eye of the Beholder: Examining the Function of the Gaze in Charlotte Bronte's The Professor and Jane Eyre</field><field name="creator">Whittington, Elizabeth Michelle</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I use G.W.F. Hegel?s notions of self-consciousness and self-awareness to examine the function of the gaze in two of Charlotte Bront&#235;?s early novels, The Professor and Jane Eyre. The first chapter of the thesis discusses William Crimsworth?s intimate relationship with two women, Mademoiselle Zoraide Reuter and Frances Evans Henri. The first relationship with Mademoiselle Reuter does not result in a balance of power, but is essential in understanding his relationship with Frances, which does ultimately result in a balance of power. The second chapter of the thesis discusses the relationship of Fairfax Rochester and Jane Eyre. While this relationship is fraught with a great deal of complexity, I argue that ultimately Jane and Rochester achieve a balance of power in the gaze. Through the discussion of the lover?s gaze in each of these novels, I demonstrate that, contrary to Jean--Paul Sartre?s influential but very negative rendering of the power dynamics implicit in the gaze, in Bront&#235;?s works we see an affirmative, mutual reinforcing exchange in the lover?s gaze.</field><field name="date">2004-05-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05102004-190955/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selected Demography and Population Estimation of Trachemys scripta (Yellow-bellied Slider) in North Carolina as it Relates to Turtle Harvesting.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Veronica A.</field><field name="description">In the year 2000, a reported 460 turtles were removed from North Carolina for commercial use. In 2002, the reported take of turtles soared to a staggering 23,311 turtles. A continuation of this trend could severely deplete the turtle populations of North Carolina in a short time. Therefore a moratorium on commercial turtle harvesting was instituted by the North Carolina General Assembly on July 1, 2003, effective until the NC Wildlife Resources Commission could determine rules and regulations for harvesting. It is crucial to know the level of harvest that populations can sustain, and, if a population is harvestable, which age groups are most sensitive to harvest. Regulations on reporting and validation of numbers, identifications, sizes, and sex of turtles will be crucial. I conducted a mark-recapture survey of freshwater turtles in six eastern Piedmont ponds: three of which had been harvested and three of which had no record of harvest. I tested for differences in sex ratios, size and age distributions, and population densities between the harvested and unharvested populations of Yellow-bellied Sliders (Trachemys scripta). Although no significant differences were found between the two types of populations, the amount of variance in the results does not allow any clear conclusions to be drawn. Severe weather impacts on habitat may have influenced sampling results. More research is required to determine the true effects turtle harvesting has on populations, including extensive stage-based simulation modeling and determination of metapopulations.</field><field name="date">2006-05-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05102006-094922/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the Zoo and On the Farm: The Effects of an Initial Interview on Pre-Kindergarten Children?s Subsequent Recall and Resistance to Retroactive Interference</field><field name="creator">Pierce, Lauren Esther</field><field name="description">Despite the attention researchers have given to the effects of repeated interviews on eyewitness testimony, relatively few investigations have examined the effects of an initial interview on children?s event memory. This study added to the literature by investigating the effects of an initial interview on recall, resistance to retroactive interference, and source monitoring errors. One hundred four-year-old children were engaged in a staged event and were interviewed about this event 4 weeks later. Two between-participant factors, the presence or absence of an initial interview and the administration or lack of administration of a related event during the retention interval, were varied orthogonally. Children in the initial interview group demonstrated greater recall and more elaborations of the target event, regardless of whether or not they had experienced the intervening event. Among the children who were exposed to the intervening event, those who had the initial interview made fewer source monitoring errors than did those who did not have the interview. The findings are interpreted as indicating that an initial interview enhances young children?s memory reports by strengthening the memory trace and consolidating the event representation, at least under some conditions.</field><field name="date">2006-07-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05102006-135205/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">African American Perspectives: A Qualitative Study of an Informal Science Enrichment Program</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Jamila Rashida</field><field name="description">The purposes of this study were to determine what program characteristics African American parents consider when they enroll their children into an informal science education enrichment program, the parents? evaluation of a program called Jordan Academy in which they enrolled their children, and the alignment of the parents? perspectives with Black Cultural Ethos (BCE). BCE refers to nine dimensions posited by Wade Boykin, a psychologist, as comprising African American culture. Participants were parents of students that attended Jordan Academy, an informal science enrichment program designed for third through sixth grade students from underserved populations. Qualitative methodologies were utilized to perform a thorough assessment of parents? perspectives. Data sources included classroom observations, student surveys, academy curriculum, photos and video-taped class sessions. Data included teachers and parents? responses to semi-structured, audio recorded interviews and students? written responses to open-ended items on the program?s evaluation instrument. The data were analyzed for themes. and the findings compared to Black Cultural Ethos. Findings revealed that the participants believed that informal science education offered their children opportunities not realized in the formal school setting - a means of impacting their children holistically. The parents expressed the academic, cultural, and personal development of their children in their characterizations of the ideal informal science education experience and in their evaluations of Jordan Academy. Overall, the parents? views emphasized the BCE values of harmony, affect, verve, movement, orality and communalism.

It is slowly progressing chronic disease and has no precise known causes. Impact injury can lead to cellular and matrix changes in articular cartilage similar to those seen in osteoarthritis. Impact injury models are often used as models for osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to use an in vitro impact injury model to examine the distribution and timing of apoptosis cell death following an impact injury. In this study it was hypothesized that there will be an increase in apoptosis cells with increasing impact load; that over time in culture the number of apoptotic cells will increase due to lingering effects from the impaction; and that apoptosis will be most severe directly below the impaction. Paired porcine knees were obtained fresh and patellae were removed using sterile techniques. Controlled mechanical impactions were made on 12 patellae at 25 mm/s, using MTS load frame, to pre selected force levels of 1000N (characterized as medium) and 12 patellae were subjected to 2000N (characterized as high). The twelve non-impacted patellae were used as controls. Following impaction, the impact patellae were placed in organ culture for 0, 3, 7, or 14 days and subsequent degenerative changes over time were assessed. Apoptotic cells were quantified using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique. The stained cells were quantified as a percentage of the total number of cells. Changes in percentage of apoptotic cells was analyzed with experimental factors impact level, days in culture ( 0, 3, 7, 14), distance from center of impaction, and depth in tissue. There was a significant depth and time dependent increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells for high impactions. A significant increase in percentage of apoptotic cells was observed from high impactions after 14 days culture time and a significant increase in percentage of apoptotic cells, for 0 days culture time was observed from medium impactions. In conclusion magnitude of load has significant effect on chondrocyte apoptosis throughout the depth of the cartilage tissue, but depends on culture time.</field><field name="date">2007-05-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05102007-092520/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk Preference, Correlation Choice, Sabotage, and the Design of Promotion Tournaments</field><field name="creator">Yumoto, Yuji</field><field name="description">I examine properties of worker behavior under promotion tournaments, and discuss their implications for the design of promotion tournaments. Given their tasks, workers will decide how much effort they exert. In addition to this decision-making, they have the opportunity to decide their approaches to perform their tasks within their delegated authority. I define the term approach as a method, way, procedure, plan or project to perform his task, into which a worker infuses his effort. Through their approach choices, they can control the riskiness and correlation of their performances. It is shown that under the loser-selecting tournament, which means the promotion ratio is more than one-half, workers prefer a low risk approach or a common approach which peers also know well; on the other hand, under the winner-selecting tournament, which means the promotion ratio is less than one-half, they prefer a high risk approach or their own original approaches. These results suggest that the loser-selecting tournament is more efficient than the winner-selecting tournament in terms of the cost for implementing high efforts of risk-averse workers. I rigorously show this in the case of three workers. I argue that the winner-selecting tournament is better suited for the upper job levels or for firms in innovative and immature markets or industries; on the other hand, the loser-selecting tournament is better suited for the lower job levels or for firms in stable, mature, or strictly regulated markets or industries. Furthermore, I investigate properties of sabotage under tournaments. Under the one-winner tournament, each worker attacks his peers so as to minimize the maximal value of their expected performances. The sabotage operates to create more homogeneity. Under the one-loser tournament, each worker intensively attacks one peer so as to minimize the minimal value of his peers' expected performance. One worker is intensively attacked by all peers. I argue that the one-loser tournament is more subject to damage by sabotage than the one-winner tournament.</field><field name="date">2003-05-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05112003-105037/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting Electronic CRC Card Sessions with Natural Interaction</field><field name="creator">Siegler, Brad</field><field name="description">This paper is an exploration into the potential of a new collaborative tool called the DiamondTouch.

Specifically, this research explored the role that a social characteristic of the testing situation, group composition, had on memory performance. The study tested older adults (N=72) between the ages of 65 and 75 who were evenly divided into three testing conditions. In the minority status condition, one older adult was tested with two younger adult confederates whereas in the majority status condition, older adults were tested with two similarly aged individuals. The third condition involved individualized testing. It was expected that older adults would experience stereotype threat in the minority status condition and that this would result in poorer performance on a memory task relative to those in the majority status and alone conditions. Contrary to expectations, memory performance did not significantly differ between the three conditions, providing no support for the hypothesis that group composition at testing would be related to stereotype threat . In addition, no evidence was found that the hypothesized moderators (stigma consciousness, value placed on memory) and mediators (anxiety, evaluation apprehension, strategy use) were related to threat-based effects.</field><field name="date">2005-05-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05112005-023212/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiagent Referral Systems: Maintaining and Applying Trust and Expertise Mode</field><field name="creator">Ranjit, Narendran</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the challenge of assisting people to solve a problem by helping locate other people who might have the expertise required to solve that problem.

It provides heuristics by which an agent can estimate the expertise and trust to be placed in a user with whom the agent's user interactis. Our approach seeks to reduce the problem of finding an answer to a query to the problem of finding a path to a trustworthy expert who can answer the query.

Proteomics is the venture to identify and characterize proteins encoded by genes, including post-translational modifications and alternatively-spliced forms. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has become a key technology for proteomics measurements owing to the afforded sensitivity and molecular specificity of the technique. Moreover, in this dissertation it is shown that the ability of Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry to analyze large numbers of analytes (known as the peak capacity) enables complex mixture analysis. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics measurements to date in large part have focused on the identification of proteins, including post-translational modifications. Increasingly, mass spectrometry based proteomics methods for absolute and relative quantification are emerging. Herein, normalization strategies utilizing synthetic exogenous peptides with masses that do not overlap with endogenous peptides, allowing for the assessment of mass measurement accuracy and retention time reproducibility, are presented. In combination, the internal standards and normalization strategies afford accurate and reproducible protein quantification. Little research has been published to date that explores the fundamental aspects of quantitative proteomics. The work presented in this dissertation examines fundamental aspects, specifically, the role physical (post-excite radius, axial confinement fields, signal decay rate, temperature) and chemical (hydrophobicity) characteristics have on accurate protein quantification by electrospray ionization-Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Examination of the instrumental parameters (post-excite radius, excitation voltages, trapping voltages, excitation waveforms) that lend to confident identification and accurate quantification of proteins in complex mixtures enables future quantitative proteomics measurements. Moreover, the understanding and development of strategies that increase ion abundance (hydrophobicity), and subsequently lower the limit of detection, will facilitate future studies of low abundance proteins.</field><field name="date">2007-05-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05112007-173516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of a Pneumatic Baling System for Burley and Flue-cured Tobacco.</field><field name="creator">Boaz, Robert Dale</field><field name="description">Current tobacco baling technology utilizes hydraulic power to press tobacco into bales. The high system pressures at which hydraulic systems operate pose a risk to workers. Hydraulic systems are costly and hydraulic oil leaks contaminate baled tobacco. A pneumatically driven, vertically oriented, multi-stroke baler was designed as an affordable alternative to current hydraulic balers. Pneumatics was chosen due to the lower system operating pressure and absent risk of tobacco bale contamination. The transmission of power was achieved through a reversible pneumatic gearmotor turning left and right hand acme threaded rods coupled together to form a powerscrew. The plunger was driven by a scissor-jack design and was used to take advantage of the non-linear force response of tobacco. The scissor-jack was driven by acme nuts traveling along the acme rod of the powerscrew. The baler was tested with burley tobacco grown during the 2007 season at the Central Crops Research Station in Clayton, NC. The compressive force and plunger displacement was measured for each bale produced. These readings were used to determine the compressive force as a function of plunger travel and the compressive force as a function of bale density. The baler required 3-4 presses to produce burley bales roughly 42 inches cubed and weighing approximately 500-600 pounds.</field><field name="date">2008-06-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05112008-145659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Stable Isotopes and GIS Modeling to Study Late Pleistocene to Holocene Environmental Change in the Waipaoa Sedimentary System, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Childress, Laurel</field><field name="description">The source to sink investigation of complex sedimentary systems necessitates chemical (stable isotope and elemental) and physical (modeling) analyses to elucidate temporal changes in volume and provenance of sediment supply. The stable isotopic composition of organic matter in continental margin sediments provides a useful, long-term record of environmental change. The Waipaoa River watershed, New Zealand, represents a system of interest due to its location on an active margin, very large sediment supply, and well known, relatively recent history of anthropogenic disturbance. Radiocarbon measurements of three continental shelf cores taken aboard the RV Marion Dufresne in January 2006 offshore from the river mouth suggest a record extending into the late Pleistocene, dating as far back as 14,000 years. Geographic information systems (GIS) modeling suggests large increases in erosion with reduction in landcover due to natural volcanic events and anthropogenic disturbances. Carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of terrestrial sources including soil profiles, sedimentary rocks and riverine sediments from within the watershed suggest terrestrial processes such as shoreline progradation, hillslope erosion and gully incision, volcanic eruptions, and the capture of river tributaries are possibly influencing isotopic ratios and impacting the marine stratigraphic record. Unique isotopic signatures of soil profiles from disparate areas of the watershed could explain some isotopic variation seen in the cores as deviation in delivery volume from certain tributaries. Within the marine record in all three cores exists a distinct excursion of carbon isotopes to more positive values. Possible explanations for this include: 1) an increase in the flux of an isotopically heavy terrestrial fraction from the erosion of kerogen and 2) a decrease in the proportion of terrestrial organic matter due to dilution of river sediments with volcanic ash. Increasing nitrogen isotope values also within the excursion could suggest an increase in marine organic matter, however this could be the result of increased input of degraded refractory terrigenous organic matter or contributions of inorganic nitrogen.</field><field name="date">2009-08-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05112009-154657/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploiting Computational Locality in Global Value Histories.</field><field name="creator">Bodine, Jill T.</field><field name="description">Value prediction is a speculative technique to break true data dependencies by predicting uncomputed values based on history. Previous research focused on exploiting two types of value locality (computation-based and context-based) in the local value history, which is the value sequence produced by the same instruction that is being predicted. Besides local value history, value locality also exists in global value history, which is the value sequence produced by all dynamic instructions according to their execution order. In this thesis, a new type of value locality, computational locality in global value history is studied. A prediction scheme, called gDiff, is designed to exploit one special and most common case of this computational model, the stride-based computation, in global value history. Experiments show that there exists very strong stride type of locality in global value sequences and ideally the gDiff predictor can achieve 73% prediction accuracy for all value producing instructions without any hybrid scheme, much higher than local stride and local context prediction schemes. However, the ability to realistically exploit locality in global value history is greatly challenged by the value delay issue, i.e., the correlated value may not be available when the prediction is being made. The value delay issue is studied in an out-of-order (OOO) execution pipeline model and the gDiff predictor is improved by maintaining an order in the value queue and utilizing local stride predictions when global values are unavailable to avoid the value delay problem. This improved predictor, called hgDiff, demonstrates 88% accuracy and 69% prediction coverage on average, outperforming a local stride predictor by 2% higher accuracy and 13% higher coverage.</field><field name="date">2002-05-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122002-121743/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Verification of Non-Linear Behavior of Over-end Yarn Unwinding From Cylindrical Packages</field><field name="creator">GODAWAT, PRAPHUL</field><field name="description">Over-end unwinding has been proved to be the most optimal process to transfer yarn from one package to another in order to improve the quality and the characteristics of subsequent processes like warping and weaving. It is the highly non-linear behavior of this unwinding process that the variation in the quality of the final product is found and if this behavior is not controlled, the variation becomes more pronounced. This non-linear behavior should be well understood to select the optimum process parameters for a given operation and subsequent processing. This research study is done to analyze the effects of various process parameters on the tension distribution and balloon profile and to experimentally validate the mathematical model set forth for predicting the behavior of over-end unwinding. The materials used for the experiments are Polyester multifilament yarns of different linear densities (70, 270 and 500 denier). The variables used for the study purpose are Unwinding Speed, Mass Linear Densities, Package Diameters, and Guide-eye Distances. Balloon images are captured using a high-speed camera and the images are synchronized with the tension readings. Since three levels of each variable are used, 81 numbers of tests are conducted. Accordingly, the influence of changes in variables as well as the direction of unwinding (front-to-back or back-to-front) is seen for the tension distribution and balloon profile. The results of the experiments are compared with the theoretical predictions. In agreement with the theory, increase in the balloon height causes increase in tension. Also, the reduction in balloon count is accompanied by the increase in tension. Highest possible tension is seen with single balloon formations. With the same balloon count, an increase in unwinding speed gives rise to increased tension.</field><field name="date">2003-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122003-023900/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphic Distribution, Taphonomy, and Isotope Paleoecology of the Dinosaurian Fauna in the latest Campanian lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, Alberta, Canada</field><field name="creator">Straight, William Herbert</field><field name="description">Vertebrate fossils in the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation are remains of dinosaurs, crocodilians, champsosaurs, turtles, and fish supported during the last ~2 m.y. of the Campanian by a coastal lake-strewn wetland occupying what is now south-central Alberta, Canada. Bones accumulated on the floodplain through attritional mortality and are preserved unweathered except for surface polish, scratches, and mottling characteristic of bioturbation during rapid burial in fine-grained sediment. Fossil-bearing sites cluster stratigraphically in laterally extensive horizons between thicker less fossil-rich intervals of similar fluvial strata. These horizons, formed by a long-term balance between bone supply, accommodation, and depositional rate, result from a newly recognized ?floodplain fill? mode of preservation for vertebrate fossils and are analogous to marine condensed sections. Like condensed sections, these fossiliferous horizons lie adjacent to lithostratigraphic surfaces created by stillstands in base-level. Together, hiatal surfaces and fossiliferous horizons reveal repeating rhythms in the facies distribution and fluvial architecture. These rhythms, ?packages? of strata bounded by hiatal surfaces, arose through two scales of variation in base-level: a grand-scale base-level cycle reflecting tectonic control during the construction of the clastic wedge, and a smaller ?package?-scale cycle reflecting Milankovitch control over local climate and precipitation. Both the fluvial architecture and the accumulations of fossils are a consequence of this change in accommodation and sediment supply through time. Fossil evidence does not indicate a faunal change through time, but changes in climate through time resulted in a reduction in organic-rich mudrocks and coal, an increase in soil development, and changes in the dominant configuration for fossil preservation from sparse bonebeds to microsites. Climate change was also investigated through stable oxygen isotopes in tyrannosaur tooth enamel phosphate, which daily recorded the response of surface (drinking) water to changes in humidity and temperature. The enamel isotopic record shows a transition from highly variable, seasonal climate to relatively constant conditions, consistent with the interpretation of change in the stratigraphy and taphonomy. This combined application of architectural stratigraphy, vertebrate taphonomy, and stable isotope paleoecology represents a new approach for paleontologists interested in evaluating changes through geologic time in paleoenvironment and animal communities in a fluvial succession.</field><field name="date">2003-06-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122003-193130/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of Cortisol in Saliva Relative to Serum in Lactating Cows, Heifer Calves and Piglets in Response to Applied Stress.</field><field name="creator">Weston, Emily Iris</field><field name="description">The objective was to examine the efficacy of saliva collection techniques and salivary cortisol assay to determine potential stress response in dairy heifers post challenge with adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) (Experiment 1), lactating cows without experimental stressors (Experiment 2), and gilt piglets versus boar piglets within two hours post castration stress (Experiment 3). Data were from the Holstein and Jersey dairy herd maintained by the Dairy Educational Unit at North Carolina State University and the crossbred swine herd maintained by the Swine Educational Unit also at North Carolina State University. In cattle (Experiments 1 &amp; 2), saliva was collected using gauze squares secured by hemostats and introduced to each animal&#226;s mouth until soaked. The same procedure was followed for the piglets (Experiment 3) with the addition of Sprite&#226;&#162; to the gauze before introduction into the animals&#226; mouth. Serum and saliva cortisol concentrations show a similar pattern after a stimulus to the adrenal gland with ACTH in Experiment 1. Salivary cortisol concentrations were lower than that found in serum and ranged from 27.40% to 59.94% of serum concentrations. In Experiment 2 the lack of an induced stress in lactating cows did not provide sufficient circulating cortisol for the sensitivity of the radioimmunoassay procedure utilized in this project. Data from these collections do illustrate the lack of a measureable stress response in animals from all three cow groups studied: Blood only, blood and saliva, or saliva only collection suggesting that neither sampling method elicits more stress response than the other. Sufficient saliva and circulating cortisol were obtained from the boar and gilt piglets in Experiment 3 to support our hypothesis that saliva is a viable tool for assessing stress in piglets. Mean concentrations for gilts were significantly lower than that of the castrated boars (1.36&#194;&#177;0.301 versus 2.3074&#194;&#177; 0.22 ng/mL).</field><field name="date">2009-08-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122009-103900/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating a Positive School Culture in Newly Opened Schools</field><field name="creator">Holmes, Michael Todd</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine the most effective practices by school administrators when creating school culture in newly opened schools. Using semi-structured interviews, four principals who opened a new school were interviewed individually and in a focus group. The constant comparative method was used to analyze the data. Two themes emerged from the data. First, principals at new schools should spend a significant amount of time ensuring quality staff members are hired. Additionally, once hired, principals are responsible for providing appropriate professional development activities to better prepare staff members to meet the challenges of opening a new school. Second, principals must find a balance between their role as principal of the school and their personal and family lives. This balance takes three forms: 1) Shared Responsibility, 2) Manager vs. Instructional Leader, and 3) Personal and Family Responsibilities. Limitations to the study included generalization to other studies, personal biases and objectivity on the part of the researcher, small sample size and lack of a high school participant. By applying what has worked, and avoiding what was not successful, administrators are in a better position to ensure a smooth opening, a satisfied school community, and, most importantly, successful students, all which are reflective of the school&#226;s culture.</field><field name="date">2009-07-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Administration and Supervision</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122009-150844/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Testing of Unreinforced Masonry Walls Strengthened with Orthogonal Near-Surface Mounted CFRP Subjected to Out-of-Plane Loading</field><field name="creator">Wylie, John Curtis</field><field name="description">Unreinforced masonry (URM) structures comprise a considerable proportion of the building stock worldwide. However, these structures generally do not behave well under extreme wind or earthquake loading. As part of on-going research, methods of repairing or strengthening URM walls subject to out-of-plane loading using fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) are being investigated. For several reasons, one method showing particular promise is the use of near-surface mounted (NSM) Carbon FRP strips. Research to-date has made significant progress in quantifying the fundamental behavior of the bonded FRP-to-masonry interface and the behavior of URM walls repaired with vertical FRP strips subject to out-of-plane loading. This thesis presents the experimental results of five large-scale clay brick masonry walls strengthened using NSM CFRP strips and loaded out-of-plane statically to failure using an airbag system. Vertical and Horizontal NSM configurations were tested separately as well as orthogonal grid configurations constructed using two different techniques. The experimentally observed failure mechanisms are described in detail for each wall.</field><field name="date">2009-08-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122009-152004/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparative Study of Serotype 1/2a and Serotype 4b Strains of Listeria monocytogenes in Biofilms Using a Simulated Food Processing System</field><field name="creator">Pan, Youwen</field><field name="description">The majority of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from foods and the environment are serotype 1/2a strains. However, serotype 4b strains cause the majority of human listeriosis outbreaks. The purpose of the research has been to compare the growth of serotype 1/2a strains and serotype 4b strains in biofilms. A method to enumerate viable L. monocytogenes cells of each serotype in mixed culture biofilms was developed using real-time PCR with propidium monoazide. To determine the competitive fitness of strains of serotype 1/2a and 4b, cocktails of each serotype were mixed to form biofilms. The biofilms were treated with a simulated food processing (SFP) system composed of repeated cycles of growth, sanitation treatment, and starvation. Data show that the serotype 1/2a strains were generally more efficient than the 4b strains at forming biofilms and predominated in the mixed culture biofilms. The growth of 4b strains was not inhibited in mixed culture biofilms compared to the single serotype (4b) biofilms in the SFP system. To compare the density of biofilms formed by strains of the two serotypes, 18 strains of each serotype were examined for biofilm formation under a variety of conditions, including varying concentrations of glucose, sodium chloride and ethanol at different temperatures using a microplate assay. Results indicate that the serotype 1/2a strains formed higher density biofilms than the 4b strains under most conditions. The data from this project support the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a strains are more efficient in biofilm production than 4b strains and may help to explain the higher percentage of 1/2a isolates from foods and the environment.</field><field name="date">2009-06-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05122009-233611/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effectiveness of Cerclage Wiring on Stabilizing Intra-Operative Femoral Fractures During Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty in Canines.</field><field name="creator">McCulloch, Ryan McCulloch Sterling</field><field name="description">Force is required to prepare the bone and achieve the initial press fit for an uncemented hip implant during Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) surgery. In some situations, this force may cause of an intra-operative femoral fracture resulting in an unstable implant, subsidence, and pain for the patient. Many of the less extensive fractures can be repaired with cerclage wire or cables. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of double loop cerclage wire(s) to restore the stability of the implant-bone interface after a simulated intra-operative fracture. Nine femora from euthanized canine were harvested for in vitro testing. The femora were prepared for implantation of an uncemented femoral stem (BFX&#226;&#162; series, BioMedtrix, Boonton, NJ). They were then potted and mounted in a materials testing machine (MTS 858 Mini Bionix II, Eden Prairie, MN). The implant was driven to a clinically appropriate height, struck with 3 impacts (simulating seating hammer blows), and then the stem loaded to failure. Once a fracture occurred, the implant was extracted, the femur was repaired with appropriate cerclage, re-broached, and re-implanted. The repaired specimen was then tested in the same fashion as the intact bone. During loading, the displacement of the implant relative to the bone was measured using a linearly variable differential transformer LVDT. The force to initiate subsidence, the peak force at failure, and the peak subsidence distance were compared between intact (pre-fracture) and repaired (post-fracture) specimens using ANOVA with blocking by specimen. The wired specimens demonstrated a higher force to initiate subsidence than the intact specimens (2378.8N &#194;&#177; 656.9N c.f. 1705.1N &#194;&#177; 584.5N; p= 0.0019). The wired specimens also sustained a higher peak force at failure than the intact specimens (3309.0N &#194;&#177; 609.14N c.f. 2276.3N &#194;&#177; 855.6N; p=0.0022). Furthermore, the wired specimens did not subside a significantly greater amount than the intact specimens (Intact: 3.90mm, SD=2.09mm; Wired: 6.71mm, SD=3.66mm; p-value = 0.0600). Cerclage wiring of intra-operative femoral fractures was able to restore the integrity of the femur and enable a stable implant-bone interface to be achieved.</field><field name="date">2008-05-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05132008-095547/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Acceptability of Treatment Plan Implementation Monitoring and Feedback Methods</field><field name="creator">Easton, Julia Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Treatment plan implementation (TPI) monitoring and feedback methods have increased TPI levels in single subject designs (e.g., DiGennaro, Martens, &amp; McIntyre, 2005) and a randomized field trial (e.g., Noell, Witt, Slider, Connell, Gatti, et al., 2005). However, when procedures like these are innovative and require significant changes in regular practices, the level of teacher satisfaction is an important consideration (Eckert &amp; Hintze, 2000), and the extent to which teachers view various monitoring and feedback methods as acceptable is unknown. The purposes of this research were to examine teachers&#226; acceptability ratings of specific TPI monitoring and feedback methods, differences in acceptability ratings between teachers with certain characteristics, and other TPI support methods that teachers identify. In this study, teachers completed a survey that assesses acceptability of specific monitoring and feedback methods, gathers information on various teacher characteristics, and provides teachers with an opportunity to write about other potential methods of TPI support. Results from this study suggested that there are significant differences between acceptability ratings regarding the personnel involved, frequency, communication format, and procedures of TPI monitoring and feedback methods. There was also a significant effect of primary teaching assignment on acceptability of TPI monitoring methods.

In 1991, the USDA Forest Service installed the Long-Term Soil Productivity study in the Croatan National Forest in Craven County, NC. The study objectives were to compare indices of plant-available inorganic N from ion-exchange resin (IER) in bead and membrane form and aerobic incubations in a 8-week study, and to analyze the effects of harvest intensity and site preparation on N availability and tree growth ten years after planting. Site treatments included three levels of organic matter removal and two levels of compaction arranged in a strip-plot design replicated in three blocks. Block 1 consisted primarily of Goldsboro soil, while Blocks 2 and 3 consisted of Lynchburg. The two-month study showed no correlation of the N availability among the three techniques. The short duration of the study and the low soil fertility at the site may have contributed to the lack of correlation, indicating that the two forms of IER may not be equally effective at low nutrient concentrations. Through the 2001 growing season, IER membranes were used to measure soil NO3 and NH4 biweekly. Non-linear analysis indicate that total inorganic N recovered from the IER membranes was significantly influenced by interactions between block, organic matter removal treatment and compaction level (p=0.005). Total basal area of loblolly pines was significantly impacted by block (p=0.015) and organic matter removal treatment (p=0.032).

Unfortunately it is sometimes difficult for on-campus students to be taken to a lab setting and impossible for those who are off campus due to work, disabilities, or other complexities and taking class through distance education. This project describes a shake table experiment that is being converted to a distance-learning environment. This will include remote access, control, and protection from misuse. An aspect of the project that differentiates it from simple remote viewing of a lecture or experiment is the need to control the experiment and to protect against the possibility of damage occurring to this particular setup if left unmonitored. This last point necessitates the inclusion of sufficient safety protocols. The environment must allow remote controlling of the system, multi-user viewing, data saving, and download capabilities. The technology selected for use in this project is the LabVIEW programming environment in conjunction with its real time counterpart, LabVIEW RT. By using this language, practical and intuitive control panels coupled with easy to follow data flow block diagrams are made possible. The LabVIEW code likewise handles the data acquisition. The information sent and received through the DAQ card is processed by LabVIEW RT code embedded in the real time processor. The information is then sent to a host computer for saving, visualization, and distribution to remote clients. This visualization includes an oscilloscope for displaying the accelerations from both the table and the structure residing on the table. Further visualization is given by way of a video camera. The code must be made safe from unauthorized usage in addition to allowing for the university network to remain protected. This research outlines in detail the setup required and programs needed to implement such a system and presents the information in a manner that can be helpful regardless of the programming language chosen.</field><field name="date">2003-06-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05142003-003926/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Malagasy Primates: Nutrition and Gastrointestinal Physiology with an Emphasis on Fiber Utilization</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Jennifer Louise</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to compare lemur species and characterize differences that are related to gastrointestinal morphology and physiology. Four lemur species that differ in feeding ecology, V. variegata, E. fulvus, P. verreauxi, and H. griseus, were selected for use in studies designed to focus on key aspects of gastrointestinal morphology or physiology that may differ. V. variegata, a frugivore, and E. fulvus, a generalist, were similar in many respects. Transit time through the gut was rapid (4.03 &#177; 1.6 h and 3.25 &#177; 1.6 h; mean &#177; SE ) and without discernable compartmental slowing. Gastric emptying of 1.5mm radio-opaque spheres (BIPS) was rapid for both species (0.25-0.50 h). Dry matter (DM) (55.5 &#177; 1.4% and 58.6 &#177; 1.4%) and insoluble fiber (IF) (19.7 &#177; 3.4% and 27.7 &#177; 3.4%) digestibility was low for both by comparison to H. griseus and P. verreauxi. However fecal inoculum from V. variegata fermented soluble fiber substrates (citrus pectin) at a greater rate at 3 h of total short-chain fatty acid fermentation (141.1 &#177; 12.1 &#181;mol*h-1*g of original substrate (OS) for V. variegata vs. 44.4 &#177; 12.1 &#181;mol*h-1*g of OS for E. fulvus), suggesting enhanced fermentation of soluble fiber (SF). H. griseus, a bamboo feeder, and P. verreauxi, a folivore, showed similarities, despite large differences in gastrointestinal morphology. The relative tract length compared to body length was 13:1 for P. verreauxi and 4.2:1 for H. griseus but both were equal in DM (72.0 &#177; 1.4% and 76.3 &#177; 1.4%) and IF (53.1 &#177; 3.4% and 62.3 &#177; 3.4%) digestibility. Within tract transit differed also in that gastric emptying of 1.5mm radio-opaque spheres was delayed (8.0-12.0 h) for P. verreauxi and was more immediate for H. griseus (1.0-2.0 h). TT and MRT of liquid and particle phase markers were also longest for H. griseus. These data add to the body of work available on primate feeding ecology, and also provide novel information useful for the nutritional management of lemurs.</field><field name="date">2003-06-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05142003-090343/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Relationship Between a Type of Spatial Ability and Two Types of Reading Errors, Symbol Reversals and Letter Interchanges</field><field name="creator">Schick, Thomas</field><field name="description">A substantial percentage of the population suffers from the effects of reading difficulties. These reading difficulties are caused by a wide array of proximate factors, some cognitive in nature, others emotional. This thesis examines whether some proximate factors, which contribute to reading difficulties, may be caused by underlying attributes which coincidentally also may provide strength in other areas of endeavor. One such proximate factor is interchanging letters, reading the word saw when was is indicated. Another such factor, symbol or letter reversing such as reading a b when a d is indicated, is most pronounced before the age of four and substantially decreases, but not entirely, over the next few years. Reversing letters presents a weakness when reading, but it may result from an underlying attribute which, coincidentally, also could underlie strength in spatial relations. This thesis examined the relationship between each factor and one type of spatial ability (mental rotation). It was hypothesized that spatial ability would be positively correlated with (a) frequency of reversals, as well as with, (b) frequency of interchanges. Experimentation was performed to test these hypotheses. The correlations found were not statistically significant. A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between frequency of symbol-letter reversals and frequency of letter interchanges. Furthermore, the frequency of these reversals and interchanges were each found to be substantially higher than had been anticipated. These results were especially interesting because they relate to a college population that might have been assumed, for the most part, to be free of such errors. Collectively, further study with a larger sample is needed in order to more fully test the hypotheses.</field><field name="date">2003-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05142003-132645/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions and Performance of African American Male Student-Athletes at a Historically Black University and a Predominantly White University</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jennifer Marie</field><field name="description">The current study examined the self-perceptions of African American male student-athletes in regards to academic abilities, athletic role, and ethnicity. More specifically, this investigation explored how academic self-concept, athletic identity, and racial identity are related to the academic performance of 101 African American male student-athletes. In addition, differences in institutional affiliation (i.e., Historically Black University and Predominantly White University) and academic level (i.e., underclassmen and upperclassmen) were examined. The participants were administered four instruments: (a) the Academic Self-Concept (ASCS), (b) the Athletic Identity Measurement Scale (AIMS), (c) the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI), and (d) the Student-Athlete Questionnaire. Results of this investigation revealed that African American male student-athletes with higher levels of athletic identity had more confidence about their academic abilities and had significantly higher cumulative grade point averages. The more African American male student-athletes identified strongly and exclusively with the athlete role the less likely they were to commitment to an ideology that emphasizes commonalities of all human beings (i.e., humanist). In addition, African American male student-athletes who had higher academic self-concept scores had significantly higher cumulative grade point averages. As for Racial Ideology, African American male student-athletes attending the Predominantly White University reported significantly higher Assimilation, Humanist, Oppressed Minority, and Nationalist subscale scores. Finally, the results for athletic identity showed a three-way interaction among university affiliation, academic level, and sport participation.

The research involved the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel biomanipulation system that is a test-bed for applying intelligent control algorithms. The microinjection process was controlled from a computer via a joystick or by software controllers. These included real-time video processing for the acquisition of experimental data and control. Teleoperated microinjections under the control of both expert and novice operators showed that the system is effective, easy to use, and capable of eliminating the need for the extensive training of microinjection personnel. Experimental results showed that all operators obtained a microinjection success rate over 80%, demonstrating a significant improvement over the tradition manual microinjections. Furthermore, blastocysts injected using this system were more likely to develop to term, and to yield chimeras, than blastocysts injected using the traditional manual method. The experiments also highlighted common problems encountered during the blastocyst microinjection stage, allowing the design and development of effective control algorithms to guide the teleoperated and automatic microinjections. Overall, this research contributed to the full automation of blastocyst microinjection by: 1) significantly improving the microinjection process; 2) significantly improving the microinjection efficiency; 3) creating a new system design optimized for computer controlled microinjections; 4) implementing and evaluating speed-up methods that enable real-time template matching; 5) creating new algorithms to identify and analyze blastocyst images; 6) designing and conducting preliminary tests with control algorithms that automate the microinjection process.</field><field name="date">2007-05-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05142007-120831/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling to Quantify the Capacity and Efficacy of Emergency Preparedness and Response Systems: A Study of the North Carolina Health Alert Network</field><field name="creator">Wynter, Sharolyn Antonia</field><field name="description">Following the attacks of September 11th, the growing fear of a bioterrorist attack emerged within the United States and pushed the threat of bioterrorism to the forefront of the public health emergency preparedness and response agenda. Despite the investment of more than six billion dollars in federal funding towards emergency preparedness and response initiatives, well defined and broadly accepted performance measures for determining the efficacy of these systems have yet to be established. Because of the complex and dynamic conditions under which emergency preparedness and response systems must perform, it is becoming apparent that traditional measures of evaluating the performance of public health systems simply will not suffice. The inability to accurately capture and quantify this information has created knowledge gaps which hinder our ability to measure our true level of preparedness and ultimately weakens our response capacity. It is therefore essential that we develop methodologies that enable us to establish valid metrics which capture the information needed to quantify the capacity and efficacy of these systems. As a key information sharing and communication component of North Carolina&#226;s Public Health Information Network (NC PHIN), the North Carolina Health Alert Network (NCHAN) serves as a promising means to measure emergency preparedness and response capacity. The goal of this thesis is to present a methodology for extending approaches in operations research and systems engineering to better understand the value of emergency preparedness and response systems, such as NCHAN. Ultimately we seek to determine how NCHAN has aided to emergency preparedness and response by quantifying the added value of the system to the greater &#226;preparedness and response&#226; process. We demonstrate the use of statistical analysis, simulation and the IDEF0 mapping process as valid tools for modeling and quantifying the less-tangible aspects of emergency preparedness and response. We find that although the capacity exists within NCHAN to increase emergency preparedness and response, other factors, such as usage variability amongst NCHAN users, lack of integration with other NC PHIN components, and limited capacity of tangible system resources (such as labs, funding and public health practitioners) limits the efficacy of NCHAN. These findings suggest that user standardization, component integration and proper resource allocation will be necessary in order to realize the true value of emergency preparedness and response systems.</field><field name="date">2009-08-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05142009-010831/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faculty Outcomes from Industry-University Collaboration</field><field name="creator">Meagher, Beth Marie</field><field name="description">A large amount of research and development in the United States takes place at universities. In spite of the great number of research projects that have been done on industry-university research collaboration and industry-university research centers, the university faculty member has been relatively neglected in these studies. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to determine what information was available about faculty involved in industry-university collaboration. Limitations of the literature are discussed. Though the literature provides a general description of faculty involvement in industry-university collaboration, there is a strong need for further research in this area. This study sought to determine the kinds of benefits and outcomes that faculty members receive from their involvement in industry-university research centers and whether these benefits predict outcomes related to publications and satisfaction. Faculty from industry-university research centers nationwide were surveyed about their center involvement. Results showed variables at three organizational levels, the university, the center, and the individual, predicted satisfaction and scholarly productivity of the faculty member. The receipt of benefits by the faculty member (such as support for graduate students, access to equipment, opportunities for consulting, opportunities for research contracts, chances for promotion and tenure, and interaction with faculty) positively influenced outcomes related to satisfaction, theses and dissertations, total publications and presentations, publications and presentations with students, and publications and presentations with member scientists. Further, faculty symmetry with industry also predicted satisfaction and scholarly productivity.</field><field name="date">2002-05-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152002-102758/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benchmark Characterization of Embedded Processors</field><field name="creator">Dasarathan, Dinesh</field><field name="description">The design of a processor is an iterative process, with many cycles of simulation, performance analysis and subsequent changes. The inputs to these cycles of simulations are generally a selected subset of standard benchmarks. To aid in reducing the number of cycles involved in design, one can characterize these selected benchmarks and use those characteristics to hit at a good initial design that will converge faster. Methods and systems to characterize benchmarks for normal processors are designed and implemented. This thesis extends these approaches and defines an abstract system to characterize benchmarks for embedded processors, taking into consideration the architectural requirements, power constraints and code compressibility. To demonstrate this method, around 25 benchmarks are characterized (10 from SPEC, and 15 from standard embedded benchmark suites - Mediabench and Netbench), and compared. Moreover, the similarities between these benchmarks are also analyzed and presented.</field><field name="date">2005-05-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152005-170108/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SURFACE-CONFINED RESPONSIVE POLYELECTROLYTE BRUSHES</field><field name="creator">Stone, Jason Lee</field><field name="description">Polyelectrolytes contain either acidic or basic monomeric units along their backbones.

We synthesize surface-grafted weak polyelectrolytes (polyelectrolyte brushes) and explore how their physico-chemical characteristics (most notably the brush height) depend on molecular weight, composition, solution pH, and ionic strength.

The kinematics involved in this type situation requires that a constant point in space (trocar point) is maintained along a rigid tool while repositioning the manipulator. Results show that the localization algorithm and interactive interface developed is capable of using this unique robot configuration to perform the desired task. For this system, error was used as the performance metric. Positioning of the endoscopic manipulator relative to the world coordinate frame was possible to within 0.05 inch. Error in maintaining a constant point in space is evident during repositioning however this was caused by limitations in the robot arm.</field><field name="date">2006-05-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152006-160438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age-Related Differences in the Influence of Affect on Judgment Processes: Selectivity versus Selective Preservation?</field><field name="creator">Leclerc, Christina Marie</field><field name="description">Research has indicated that aging is associated with declines in executive functioning, as well as with significant neuronal loss in associated brain regions. Interestingly, research has also indicated relatively less age-related decline in regions of the brain linked to affective processing, and no significant age differences in performance on tasks assessing affective functioning. Given that older adults experience executive declines, it may be that the selective preservation of affective processing structures in the brain results in a greater reliance on affective processing systems compared to younger adults. This shift in reliance on affective processing may be reflected in increased dependence on less resource-demanding, automatic processing mechanisms, as well as maintenance in performance on tasks dependent on processing of affective information. The current work is an attempt to examine the relative influence of deliberative versus affective processes of younger (ages 18-30, M = 18.6) and older (ages 63-73, M = 71.8) adults using a social judgment task. Participants read a series of descriptions that varied in the number of positive and negative traits they contained. A subset of these traits was relevant to performance in a particular occupation. Participants were required to either make an overall impression judgment (based on all traits) or a job-related judgment (based only on the relevant subset of traits). Results indicate that all participants were able to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant attributes and made more accurate general impression ratings than job effectiveness ratings. The hypothesized lower levels of performance in older adults in the job judgment condition due to the presumed involvement of executive processes in distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant traits was not supported in spite of lower observed levels of functioning of older adults on a variety of executive functioning tasks. Social judgment abilities appear to be relatively well preserved in healthy older adults. It may be that social judgment tasks are unique in that performance on these tasks draws from relatively well preserved brain systems, or is maintained as a result of greater social expertise, permitting older adults to exhibit continued high levels of functioning.</field><field name="date">2006-05-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152006-160956/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local dispersal and coexistence in a metacommunity model with trophic structure</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Matthew Williams</field><field name="description">One of the major goals of ecology is to understand the mechanisms which promote species coexistence. Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding how spatial processes influence diversity. Here we present a pair of models designed to investigate the role of one spatial process, localized dispersal, in promoting regional species coexistence when trophic structure is present. The model community considered is a two-predator, two-prey assemblage with cyclic endstates. Through analysis and simulation, we show that increasing the range of species dispersal can inhibit regional species coexistence. This result is at odds with the conclusions of some previous studies which considered locality within a single trophic level, and suggests that the relationship between dispersal distance and regional coexistence may be more complicated than previously realized.</field><field name="date">2007-05-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152007-153807/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological and Physiological Basis for the Distribution of Woody Plants along Water Availability Gradients in the Southeastern United States Mixed Forest</field><field name="creator">Abit, Pamela Po</field><field name="description">Higher temperatures under climate change are likely to result in greater evaporation and increased soil moisture deficits. Increased drought will likely cause a shift in the vegetation distribution. This study focused on woody plants of the Southeastern United States mixed forest. Although water is not a primary limiting factor in this forest, species distribution suggests that water availability exerts a strong control on the success of woody plants. I used a comparative approach to understand environmental factors and corresponding species traits that determine species composition across a gradient of water availability. I compared hydraulic architecture, vulnerability to cavitation, and the ability of xeric and mesic species to germinate, grow and survive under varying levels of water stress. Congeneric pairs composed of one xeric and one mesic species were used. Seeds were subjected to polyethylene glycol solutions of different water potentials to compare the effects of water availability on germination of xeric and mesic species. I used understory saplings to compare the difference in the xylem hydraulic properties between xeric and mesic species and the air-injection method was used to determine differences in their xylem vulnerability to cavitation. I performed a dry-down experiment to compare the ability of the xeric and mesic species to survive extreme drought by evaluating survival after re-watering subsequent to drought exposure. Growth performance was evaluated by measuring electron transport rate (ETR), stomatal conductance (gs), shoot and root biomass of seedlings that were exposed to different levels of water (well-watered, dry, and flooded) and nutrients (high and low). Results indicate that the ability to germinate under drought did not differ consistently between xeric and mesic species, but, germination ability under drought was associated with the ability to maintain turgor. Stems of xeric species were less vulnerable to wilting than mesic species under drought stress. I found greater resistance to xylem cavitation in xeric species than mesic species. It appears that cavitation resistance was independent of specific conductivity and wood density since I did not find any trade-off between specific conductivity and vulnerability to cavitation among the woody plants examined. In the growth performance study, xeric species tend to have lower whole plant biomass, higher Root:Shoot (R/S) ratio, higher coarse root mass ratio (CRMR) and less reduction in gs under drought stress than mesic species. The higher stomatal conductance and lower photorespiration rates among the mesic species may have influenced their increased photosynthetic rates, thereby producing a greater total plant biomass than xeric species. Species distribution along water availability gradients appears to be better explained by the ability of seedlings to resist cavitation, to tolerate and survive water stress, and by their biomass allocation patterns, rather than by their ability to germinate under drought.</field><field name="date">2008-07-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152008-104716/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vegetation of Geographically Isolated Montane Non-alluvial Wetlands of the Southern Blue Ridge of North Carolina.</field><field name="creator">Wichmann, Brenda Lynn</field><field name="description">The ecological significance of montane non-alluvial wetlands in the southern Blue Ridge region of North Carolina is well known. However, there is relatively little quantitative documentation of these community types. In particular, our understanding of montane, peat-forming wetlands is based primarily on qualitative data, and there has been no previous comprehensive classification and description of these community types. In this study, species composition and vegetation-environment relationships are described for the geographically-isolated, non-alluvial wetlands of the southern Blue Ridge region of North Carolina. A hierarchical classification is presented for 12 community types within 2 broad vegetation classes based on 136 vegetation plots spanning the range of the southern Blue Ridge region of North Carolina. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to delimit community types, and non-metric multidimensional scaling was subsequently used to help differentiate the community types identified by the cluster analysis. Although some of these community types fit well within currently recognized community concepts, others fit poorly within existing concepts, pointing to a need for definition of new types and/or significant refinement of types currently recognized. The 2 broad vegetation classes and 12 community types are discussed, each with a description of composition, related community concepts, and environmental context. Compositional variation among the types is most strongly associated with elevation, soil pH, soil nutrient availability, and soil cation exchange capacity.</field><field name="date">2009-12-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152009-120239/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal Tides and Internal Solitary Waves in the Northern South China Sea</field><field name="creator">Kim, Sungphil</field><field name="description">Large-amplitude internal solitary waves (ISWs) are frequently observed in the northern South China Sea (SCS). In a project sponsored by the US Office of Naval Research, four moorings were deployed between the Luzon Strait and the Chinese continental shelf by Steve Ramp of the Naval Postgraduate School and David Tang of National Taiwan University from late April 2005 to May 2006. Several CTD sections were taken during April and July in 2005. Satellite pictures were also collected during that period. In this study, these data were used to examine the characteristics, generation, and propagation of ISWs. In the satellite images, monthly change in stratification may cause northward shift of the propagation path, and ISWs are more frequently observed in July than in April and May. Speed estimation shows that ISWs propagate faster in the deep basin than over the continental margin and near the ridge. The generation of internal tides correlates with the eastward tidal flow over the ridge, while ISWs are produced by northwestward tidal currents over the ridges in the Luzon Strait.</field><field name="date">2009-07-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05152009-141246/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sparse Estimation and Inference for Censored Median Regression</field><field name="creator">Shows, Justin Hall</field><field name="description">Censored median regression models have been shown to be useful for analyzing a variety of censored survival data with the robustness property.

We show that, with a proper choice of the tuning parameter, the proposed estimator has nice theoretical properties such as root-n consistency and asymptotic normality. The estimator can also identify the underlying sparse model consistently. We propose using a resampling method to estimate the variance of the proposed estimator. Furthermore, the new procedure enjoys great advantages in computation, since its entire solution path can be obtained efficiently. Also, the method can be extended to multivariate survival data, where there is a natural or artificial clustering structure.

A driver may be able to view sign sheetings from a long distance with no sight obstruction. However, there are many cases in which the driver&#161;&#175;s line of sight is blocked by obstructions, such as trees, hills, curves, and other signs. These obstructions may reduce the effectiveness of the sheetings and therefore the frequency of safe response by drivers. The objectives of this project are to determine the distribution of the visibility distance for obstructed and unobstructed signs and to identify reasons for being obscure using videologs. The videologs contain images that can be used for this visibility distance study with the benefits of less cost, less potential danger, and less time than data obtained from a manual field survey. Most signs were obstructed. A little more than half of the obstructions were curves and hills, and trees were the most prevalent obstruction in the urban area that was biggest problem among the road types. About 25.4% of obstructed signs had less than 400 feet of visibility distance. In order to avoid the possible reduction of the effectiveness of traffic signs, sign placement should be considered during geometric highway design, and the impact of trees that may be growing should be taken into consideration.</field><field name="date">2003-05-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162003-102915/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnesium supplementation through drinking water to improve pork quality.</field><field name="creator">Frederick, Brent Ray</field><field name="description">Four experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of short term magnesium supplementation through drinking water prior to harvest on pork quality of pigs.

Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that the students were able to make a variety of connections among concepts related to polynomials and functions, and they easily applied their mathematical knowledge to real world phenomena. The participants suffered, however, from several misconceptions relating to the understanding of the roles of the independent and dependent variables in functions. They also struggled with the concept of symmetry and how it relates to polynomial functions. Statistical analyses suggested that belief systems were correlated with achievement, but the conclusions from this study were ambiguous since the correlations were unexpectedly negative.

The advent of the Rapid Prototyping machines partially fulfilled the realization of a personal fabricator by breaking the boundaries on the geometric form that could be realized through a machine in a single set up. The proliferation of the rapid prototyping machines into the industry and finally for domestic use, has been hampered by their costs, size and process limitations. The current trends in the Rapid Prototyping industry has been to develop machines capable of manufacturing parts in functionally graded materials. In order to achieve this, there is a need to develop means to precisely deposit a controlled combination of materials within the volume of a part. Electrophotography has been used for decades for monochrome and multicolor dry toner printing. The application of electrophotography for the generation of 3D parts through layered manufacturing has been left mostly unexplored. This thesis suggests guidelines for the development of an electrophotography based rapid prototyping process that would be cost effective in comparison with current commercial rapid prototyping technologies, as well as have the capability of depositing multiple materials. The initial research involved attempts to adapt a commercial electrophotographic printer to print in 3D. Later, experiments were conducted to indigenously build an electrophotography based layered manufacturing system. The research involved the development of transmission systems, development of power supplies to facilitate electrostatic charging, testing of polygon mirror based laser-scanning system, development of fusing and pressing station and experiments with multiple materials. Though a electrophotography based rapid prototyping machine was not realized at the end of this research, substantial evidence was generated to validate future research towards the development of such a system. Future work would involve the development of a completely automated system. Upon the completion of this system, further research could be carried out in the fields of personal fabrication, micro Rapid Prototyping, materials with directional properties, bio and materials, direct write technologies for printing circuits and functionally graded materials.</field><field name="date">2003-06-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162003-164444/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring Bimanual Tool-Based Interaction in a Drawing Environment</field><field name="creator">Butler, Colin Grant</field><field name="description">In this document, I will present HabilisDraw DT, a drawing environment in which bimanual direct manipulation and a strong tool-use metaphor are supported via the DiamondTouch input device from Mitsubishi Electronics Research Lab.

Host resistance, involving constitutive and induced defensive measures, and the factors associated with pest success are now widely understood and some losses can be avoided with proper management. Recent research with Norway spruce (Picea abies) has provided additional insight into the chemical pathways involved in host resistance, and has determined that trees exposed to mechanical wounding or fungal inoculation show acquired resistance to future pathogen attacks. This aspect of defense in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) has not been adequately investigated. However, our recent studies indicate that fungal inoculation results in elevated resin flow levels that last up to one year after treatment. Further research in southern Appalachian pines showed that elevated resin flow occurs in response to low intensity fire, and that this response is still present at 18 months after burning. These studies indicate that acquired resistance through induced resin flow in southern pines is a possibility. Further research with beetle or fungal challenges could determine new possibilities for management of both natural and planted stands in order to maximize host defenses against southern pine beetle.</field><field name="date">2005-07-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162005-201137/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TAO: A Topology-Adaptive Overlay Framework</field><field name="creator">Kandekar, Kunal</field><field name="description">Large-scale distributed systems rely on constructing overlay networks in which nodes communicate with each other through intermediate overlay neighbors. Organizing nodes in the overlay while preserving its congruence with the underlying IP topology (the underlay) is important to reduce the communication cost between nodes. In this thesis, we study the state-of-the-art approaches to match the overlay and underlay topologies and pinpoint their limitations in Internet-like setups. We also introduce a new Topology-Adaptive Overlay organization framework, TAO, which is scalable, accurate and lightweight. As opposed to earlier approaches, TAO compiles information resulting from traceroute packets to a small number of landmarks, and clusters nodes based on (1) the number of shared hops on their path towards the landmarks, and (2) their proximity to the landmarks. TAO is also highly flexible and can complement all existing structured and unstructured distributed systems. Our experimental results, based on actual Internet data, reveal that with only five landmarks, TAO identifies the closest node to any node with 85% - 90% accuracy and returns nodes that on average are within 1 millisecond from the closest node if the latter is missed. As a result, TAO overlays enjoy very low stretch (between 1.15 and 1.25). Our results also indicate that shortest-path routing on TAO overlays result in shorter end-to-end delays than direct underlay delays in 8-10% of the overlay paths.</field><field name="date">2006-05-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162006-141449/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erythromycin Susceptibility and Genomic Regions Characterization of Campylobacter coli</field><field name="creator">Chan, Kamfai</field><field name="description">Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are major bacterial food-borne pathogens that cause enteric diseases worldwide, resulting in significant public health and economic burden. These two closely related species colonize a wide range of farm animals including turkeys, pigs, chickens, and cattle. Consumption of meat (especially poultry) contaminated with C. jejuni or C. coli has been implicated as the major route of infection. When needed, antibiotics used for treatment are fluoroquinolones or macrolides such as erythromycin. Recent studies have shown that the percentage of C. coli that have resistance to antimicrobials, including those typically used for treatment of human campylobacteriosis, has increased, making it a top priority to investigate the mechanisms for acquisition and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in these pathogens. Certain Campylobacter strains harbor a transcribed intervening sequence (IVS) in their 23S rRNA genes. Following transcription, the IVS is excised, leading to fragmentation of the 23S rRNA. The origin and possible functions of the IVS are unknown. Furthermore, the distribution of IVS-harboring strains within Campylobacter populations is poorly understood. In this study, strains of Campylobacter coli from turkeys, representing numerous different multilocus sequence typing (MLST)-based sequence types (STs), were characterized in terms of IVS content and erythromycin susceptibility. We identified strains that harbored IVSs in all three 23S rRNA genes, as well as strains lacked IVSs from at least one of the genes. The STs of the latter strains belonged to an unusual cluster of C. coli STs (?cluster II?), earlier found primarily in turkey strains, and characterized by presence of the C. jejuni aspA103 allele. The majority of strains harboring IVSs in all three 23S rRNA genes were resistant to erythromycin. In contrast, cluster II strains, which harbored at least one IVS-free 23rRNA gene, were susceptible to the antibiotic. Cluster II strains could be transformed to erythromycin resistance with genomic DNA from C. coli that harbored IVS and the A2075G transition in the 23S rRNA gene, associated with resistance to erythromycin in Campylobacter. Erythromycin-resistant transformants harbored both the A2075 transition and IVS. The findings suggest that absence of IVS in C. coli from turkeys is characteristic of a unique clonal group of erythromycin-susceptible strains, and that IVS can be acquired by these strains via natural transformation to erythromycin resistance. Analysis of C. coli and C. jejuni strains isolated from broilers, turkeys and swine has shown the association of the lack of IVS and erythromycin susceptibility is unique to C. coli from turkeys. The presence of the C. jejuni aspA103 allele in the chromosome of cluster II C. coli strains is a unique characteristic of this clonal group. To further characterize the genome composition in the aspA region in cluster II strains, we determined the corresponding DNA sequences from two turkey-derived cluster II C. coli strains (6979 and 7474, of ST-1150 and ST-1161, respectively). Genomic organization upstream of the aspA gene was divergent between these two cluster II strains and the reference strain C. coli RM2228, the genome sequence of which has been completed. Genes encoding a putative Crp-family transcriptional regulator (CCO0137) and a conserved hypothetical protein (CCO0138) that were present in C. coli RM2228 and C. coli 6818 were not found in the same genomic region in C. coli 6979 or C. coli 7474. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis revealed that genes encoding subunit II of cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase (cydB) and a putative aspartate racemase (CJ0085c) harbored numerous C. jejuni-specific SNPs. Interestingly, genes encoding subunit I of cytochrome d ubiquinol oxidase (cydA) and uracil-DNA glycosylase (ung) harbored C. coli-specific SNPs in their 5? portions but C. jejuni-specific SNPs in their 3? portions, suggesting that these may be hybrid genes that were originated from C. jejuni and C. coli. Our data suggest the presence of recombination events in the genomic region between cydA and ung in cluster II strains of C. coli. Such genomic features may contribute to the observed prevalence of cluster II strains among C. coli from turkeys, and to the characteristic susceptibility to erythromycin exhibited by these strains.</field><field name="date">2007-08-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162007-114033/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationships Between Parental Beliefs About Children?s Emotions, and Children?s Perceptions and Behavior</field><field name="creator">Stelter, Rebecca Lynn</field><field name="description">The purpose of the current research was to investigate how parents? beliefs about children?s emotions are related to children?s outcomes.

Participants were African American (n = 41), European American (n = 4), and Lumbee Native American (n = 38) parents and their 4th or 5th grade children. Contrary to hypotheses, parents? beliefs did not directly relate to children?s engagement or children?s perceptions of the parent-child relationship. Howerver, parents? stress in the last 24 hours moderated the relationship between parents? beliefs and children?s perceptions of their attachment security. The relationship between parents? beliefs that negative emotions are good and children?s engagement was moderated by children?s security in the parent-child relationship. In addition, parents? reported daily stress from the last 24 hours was related to children?s engagement during the problem solving discussion.</field><field name="date">2007-05-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162007-125341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Empirical Analysis of Adaptability to Climate Change and Risk in Forest Management</field><field name="creator">Huang, Jin</field><field name="description">This dissertation provides a quantitative analysis of the adaptability in forest management to future risks using existing data describing pine growth and management across a range of conditions in the southern U.S. Future risks include gradual climatic change, catastrophic events, price and yield risks. The adaptive options considered include rotation ages, thinning ages, thinning intensity and frequency, planting density and stand stocking. Using a bio-economic model approach, two empirical yield models based on U.S. Forest Service FIA data are integrated with an extended Faustmann and a Real Options optimization models respectively. Simulation results are obtained across risk categories and model types. Marginal and joint effects of risk are derived and comparisons between different integrated models are made. Forest managers' optimal decisions in response to risk are found to be sensitive to the set of adaptive options. The &#226;standard&#226; optimal rotation results do not necessarily hold if stand density control and thinning options are considered. The impacts of discrete catastrophic events on forest management adaptation and welfare are found to be more important than the gradual climate change impact. Gradual climate change within the range of Hadley 3 scenarios does not lead to significant changes in optimal rotation age, stand density or thinning ages but the change in forest rents may be significant. Depending on the impact of climate change on agriculture rent, we would expect more adaptations at the extensive margin (land use change) than the intensive margin (silvicultural intensity).</field><field name="date">2008-08-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162008-114847/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Status and soil requirements of Rhus michauxii.</field><field name="creator">Willis, Megan Suzanne</field><field name="description">This study mapped natural Rhus michauxii populations located in North Carolina and determined that NC populations are declining.

In addition, adolescent pregnancy imposes great taxpayer and other social costs to society. Previous research has shown that neighborhood characteristics influence adolescent females&#226; sexual risk perceptions and behaviors. However, neighborhood characteristics have rarely been compared to adolescents&#226; perceptions of their own neighborhoods when examining perceptions of STDs, HIV/AIDS, or pregnancy. In fact, it is reasonable to explore the degree to which adolescents in certain neighborhood contexts may perceive pregnancy as an adaptive strategy. This study uses longitudinal data from the in-home interviews of the National Adolescent Health Survey Wave 1 to examine neighborhood characteristics, adolescent females&#226; perceptions of their neighborhood, attitudes towards STDs, HIV, and pregnancy, and parent perceptions of the neighborhood. The results show significant between group mean differences for adolescents&#226; females&#226; living in neighborhoods with high poverty rates for their perceptions toward chances of contracting an STD. In addition, adolescent females living in neighborhoods with high rates of unemployment and high proportions of young children yielded higher perceptions of risk of AIDS without protection. Adolescent females&#226; perceptions of safety in their neighborhood predicted perceptions of risk towards pregnancy; however, neighborhood perceptions did not significantly predict any other perceptions of risk. Neighborhood perceptions did not mediate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and perceptions of risk for STDs, HIV/AIDS, or pregnancy. Lastly, favorable perceptions about pregnancy as a life event were predicted by high proportions of young children in the neighborhood, with less favorable perceptions predicted by low unemployment and perceptions the neighborhood as a safe place.</field><field name="date">2008-08-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05162008-164405/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MARGARET JARMAN HAGOOD?S MOTHERS OF THE SOUTH AS SOCIOLOGICAL DOCUMENTARY</field><field name="creator">Roebuck, Daire Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to discuss why and how Margaret Jarman Hagood?s 1939 monograph, Mothers of the South: Portraiture of the White Tenant Farm Woman, was a unique contribution to the sociological and documentary study of the rural white woman in the South during the Great Depression.

Here the company is going through the problem of inefficient performance of its data warehouse. To find an appropriate solution to this problem we first try to understand the data warehouse concept and its basic architecture, followed by an in depth study of the company data warehouse and the various issues affecting it. We propose and evaluate a set of solutions including classification of suppliers, implementing corporate commodity classification and coding system, obtaining level three spend details for PCard purchases, etc. The experimental results show considerable improvement in the data quality and the data warehouse performance. We further support these recommendations by evaluating the return on investment for improved quality data.

Experiences at North Carolina State University suggest that this task is best accomplished by utilizing two separate models; one to account for the material behavior and another to account for boundary conditions, such as tire-pavement interaction, temperature gradient along the layer thickness, pavement structural design, etc. The material characterization model should focus on the material irrespective of geometry, i.e., fundamental properties. The structural model should be robust enough to account for the range of conditions experienced by pavements in service. Two peer-reviewed and published papers are presented here which deal with the development of a constitutive material model for asphalt concrete. In the first, the viscoelastoplastic continuum damage model in tension is applied to materials from the Federal Highway Administration?s Accelerated Load Facility study on modified mixture performance. It is shown that the material model is capable of describing the behavior of the tested mixtures over a range of conditions from primarily viscoelastic to primarily viscoplastic. Further, the model shows sensitivity to changes in asphalt binder and the ability to predict the behavior of asphalt concrete mixtures containing polymer modified binder. The second paper presents results from an experimental study of anisotropy in asphalt concrete. Anisotropy occurs due to the preferential orientation of aggregate particles in the mixture and is found to have varying levels of significance depending on both the mode of loading and the levels of deformation applied. In the linear viscoelastic range, anisotropy is found to have little effect on the material behavior, whereas under monotonic compressive loading until failure, it is found to contribute significantly. Further, it is found that temperature and rate affect the significance of anisotropy in asphalt concrete. Conclusions and plans for future work are also presented.</field><field name="date">2006-06-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05172006-160856/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FPGA Implementation of a SIP Message Processor</field><field name="creator">Nimmelapelli, Raja</field><field name="description">Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is fast emerging as the next generation signaling protocol.

Acidic soils of the southeastern coastal plain typically have low fertility, but weeds remain problematic even in soybean and peanut fields where no fertilizer nitrogen is applied. Field experiments using &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N natural abundance examined whether nitrogen might be transferred between the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-fixing crop species and neighboring weeds. A five year field study demonstrated that substantial nitrogen transfer did occur. Because nitrogen transfer was largely dependent on the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae, the results strongly suggested that N moved from plant to plant through mycorrhizal hyphae that connected plant root systems. Another characteristic of acid soils is the presence of high levels of aluminum. When soil pH is below 5.0, the presence of Al&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; in soil solution can cause aluminum toxicity to occur in many plants. Aluminum toxicity inhibits root growth and predisposes crop plants to drought and nutrient deficiencies. Loblolly pine was determined to be extremely tolerant to aluminum. In a series of experiments, we examined the ability of loblolly pine to exclude aluminum from root tip meristems which are known to be the main sites of aluminum toxicity. The primary and secondary roots of pine exhibited high degrees of Al tolerance. Tolerance was associated with Al exclusion from the root tips and, of the Al accumulating in the root, exclusion from the root meristem. Ectomycorrhizal colonization was found to contribute to aluminum tolerance, evidently by providing an extra barrier to Al entry into the root. Additional experiments examined Al relations of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The root systems of more than 80% of all plant species are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizae. In the presence of aluminum, colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species was inhibited. The results suggested alterations in root function caused lower colonization, as mycorrhizal infection potential appeared unaffected. Aluminum also inhibited fungal spore germination, but only at very high Al levels. Much of the function of the mycorrhizal fungi was unaffected even as aluminum accumulated in fungal structures.</field><field name="date">2006-05-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05172006-200731/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable Selection in Linear Mixed Model for Longitudinal Data</field><field name="creator">Lan, Lan</field><field name="description">Fan and Li (JASA, 2001) proposed a family of variable selection procedures for certain parametric models via a nonconcave penalized likelihood approach, where significant variable selection and parameter estimation were done simultaneously, and the procedures were shown to have the oracle property.

In many of the leading approaches such as Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo integration, the marginal likelihood is approximated, and the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) can only be reached with error. An alternative, the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm is designed to maximize an integral and can be employed to find the exact MLE under the same circumstances. However, the SPSA does not directly provide an error estimate if the algorithm is stopped in a number of finite steps. In order to estimate the MLE properly with an statistical error bound, we propose the stationary SPSA (SSPSA) algorithm. Assuming that the marginal likelihood, objective function, is quadratic around the MLE, the SSPSA takes the form of a random coefficient vector autoregressive process. Under mild conditions, the algorithm yields a strictly stationary sequence where the mean of this sequence is asymptotically unbiased to the MLE and has a closed-form variance. Also, the SSPSA sequence is ergodic providing certain constraints on the step size, a parameter of the algorithm, and the mechanism that directs the algorithm to search the parameter space. Sufficient conditions for the stationarity and ergodicity are provided as a guideline for choosing the step size. Several implementation issues are addressed in the thesis: pairing numerical derivative, scaling, and importance sampling. Following the simulation study, we apply the SSPSA on several GLMMs: Epilepsy seizure data, lung cancer data, and salamander mating data. For the first two cases, SSPSA estimates are similar to published results whereas, for the salamander data, our solution greatly differs from others.</field><field name="date">2007-05-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05172007-164438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">College Student Computer Use and Ergonomics</field><field name="creator">Noack, Karen Lee</field><field name="description">Student computer users are at risk for Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), such as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendonitis, and tension neck syndrome. Past research has identified repetition, duration, and posture as contributors to the development of MSDs in the computer work environment and these risk factors are present in the activities of student computer users as well as professional computer users. A web-based questionnaire was administered to 234 undergraduate and graduate college students majoring in either engineering or humanities and social sciences. The results of this study were compared with the results of a previous survey of professional workers that has a similar question structure. Sixty four percent of college students reported assuming an awkward posture at least 'sometimes' while using a desktop computer. On the 24-hour clock, college students reported their computer use to be at least 'somewhat likely' between the hours of 8:00 a.m. ? 2:00 a.m., while for professional workers the time period was reduced to the 12 hours between 6:00 a.m. ? 6:00 p.m. The survey also showed that college students work on the computer for closer to 90 minutes before taking a break, while the professional workers worked closer to 60 minutes before taking a break. In participants under 35 years of age, graduate students reported on average 33.7 weekly computing hours, compared to the 35.2 hours reported by professional workers. In general, college students reported a higher frequency of upper extremity discomfort than professional workers, and female participants reported higher discomfort than their male counterparts. There is still much to be learned about college students? interaction with computers, their risk of developing MSDs, and means by which risk can be reduced. The importance of incorporating ergonomics in the daily life of student computer users is apparent; it is believed that college students are likely to enter the workforce with poor computing habits and that appropriate education while the students are still in college is necessary to reduce the lifetime risk of developing these disorders.</field><field name="date">2003-06-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05182003-160527/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Journey is the Destination: Pursuing Masculinity</field><field name="creator">Hall, Mark M.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the influence of male homosocial relationships on the masculine identity performances men develop in such relationships. Specifically, I argue that three American novels?Herman Melville?s Moby-Dick, Jack Kerouac?s On the Road, and Chuck Palahniuk?s Fight Club?illustrate a similar pattern of masculine identity performance and (re)construction. In each novel, the narrator initially experiences a masculine identity crisis. In order to resolve his crisis, he engages in homosocial relationships that refine and reaffirm his masculinity. Furthermore, each narrator examines and reports the life of another man?a man obsessed with a single-minded pursuit. Ishmael of Moby-Dick narrates the events of a whaling voyage led by the Moby Dick-obsessed Captain Ahab. Sal Paradise of On the Road recites the adventures he has on the road following the IT-obsessed Dean Moriarty. And, the unnamed narrator of Fight Club explains the development of Fight Club and Project Mayhem by the revolution-obsessed Tyler Durden. As I reveal, hunting for Moby Dick, traveling the road, fighting each other and terrorizing capitalistic society all represent pursuits of manhood and ways of constructing, performing, and asserting masculinities. By joining these pursuits, the narrators forfeit their agency to these obsessed men; however, as the narrators continue to follow, they realize that to regain their masculine identities they must also eventually establish agency in their lives. Ultimately, the pattern illustrated in this thesis involves the continual remasculation of an emasculated man?or a man under threat of becoming so?through purpose-oriented homosocial relationships and an assertion of agency.</field><field name="date">2004-05-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05182004-174611/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Firm's Demand for Money: Feenstra Equivalence, Monetary Super-Neutrality and Techincal Inefficiency</field><field name="creator">Saygili, Hulya</field><field name="description">This study investigates the implications of firm's demand for real balances from the production and monetary economics perspective. Money is a component of production as a factor increasing efficiency in exchange in input markets. Firms may improve efficiency in production by holding real money to decrease their transactions cost in input market. Feenstra (1986) equivalence states that transactions cost as a cosntraint in a firm's budget is functional equivalent to money in the production fucntion. Monetary expansion may change transactions cost, hence can affect the efficiency in both goods and input markets. If a monetary model is setup in accordence with Feenstra equivalence it can be used to examine the impact of the change in money supply over net consumption and net input. Monetary expansion is no longer super-neutral over net consumption and net input because it has the ability to alter efficiency in exchange. The study concludes with an empirical test on the theory by applying the stochastic production frontier approach over 12 EU countries. The test verifies the significance of real money in determining the technical inefficiency in production.</field><field name="date">2005-05-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05182005-141025/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prevalence and Persistence of Select Foodborne Pathogens in a mid-Atlantic Turkey Processing Facility</field><field name="creator">Stam, Christina Nicole</field><field name="description">Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and Campylobacter combined are responsible for the majority of foodborne disease hospitalizations and over 1200 deaths annually in the U.S. alone. Although raw poultry has been identified as a source of these pathogens, most microbiological studies have focused on broilers with little attention given to turkey processing. The purpose of this research was to investigate the prevalence of select pathogens (L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp.) and microbiological indicators (Enterococcus spp.) in the turkey processing environment. Environmental samples were collected in one Southeastern processing facility using swab methods at two month intervals over a period of 14 months. Samples were taken from conveyors, drains, walls and various food contact surfaces. Isolation and identification of bacteria was done using the USDA-FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook protocols. The prevalence of contamination was 11.5%, 7.4%, and 0.4% for L. monocytogenes, Salmonella, and Campylobacter, respectively. Enterococcus spp., an environmental indicator of fecal contamination, were isolated from over &gt;75% of the samples screened. Salmonella isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Enterococcus isolates were speciated by PCR with antibiotic resistance profiles characterized using the SensiTitre system. A diverse set of relatively non-persistent Salmonella strains were obtained from the processing environment, as evaluated by PFGE. Thirty-nine percent of the Enterococcus isolates were speciated as E. faecium and 55% were E. faecalis. Both E. faecalis as E. faecium strains were susceptible to most antibiotics of human clinical relevance. Thirty-three L. monocytogenes strains were screened for their biofilm formation capabilities using a microtiter well assay. None of the strains formed a biofilm in monoculture; however, sixteen of the strains were able to form a biofilm in the presence of another organism.

Understanding the growth requirements of specific filamentous organisms will allow the development of better control strategies for bulking. In this study, the short term effects of eight carbon sources and three inoculum sources on the growth of filamentous bacteria were tested. Three lab scale sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were operated. Microscopic (Gram and Neisser staining) and molecular methods (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis [DGGE], Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization [FISH]) were used to track the microbial population changes in the reactors. Sludge volume index (SVI) measurements were used to monitor bulking in the reactors. DGGE and sequencing results indicated the presence of the filamentous bacteria Sphaerotilus natans and Thiothrix. S. natans grew in glucose-, acetate-, and sucrose-fed reactors, regardless of the inoculum source. It also grew in propionate- and pyruvate-fed reactors inoculated with the sludge from the Neuse River Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Thiothrix was detected in propionate- and pyruvate-fed reactors inoculated with sludge from the South Cary WWTP, and in glucose- and acetate-fed inoculated with the sludge from the Neuse River WWTP inoculated reactors. In addition to these two filaments, Gram and Neisser staining indicated the presence of Nostocoida limicola in Neuse River WWTP inoculated reactors. The presence of S. natans and T. nivea was confirmed with FISH. SVI measurements were consistent with the level of bulking, showing an increase as the number of filaments in the reactors increased. This study confirmed that readily biodegradable substrates favored the growth of S. natans, T. nivea and, N. limicola in activated sludge. The simultaneous use of microscopic and molecular tools provided the information above with one method compensating for the other method?s biases.</field><field name="date">2005-05-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05182005-214310/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancement of Online Systems in Engineering by Expert TA</field><field name="creator">Morton, Jeremy Andrew</field><field name="description">This dissertation introduces a new online system called Expert TA.

The eleven treatment schools were selected through a grant writing procedure, high technology needs and Title I status. A detailed procedure was used to identify and recruit comparison schools. Treatment schools were provided with almost $1.5 million over three years to purchase educational technology, train their teachers and staff two full-time technology related positions: Media Coordinator and Technology Facilitator. In addition, schools were required to develop and integrate a Media Technology Advisory Committee (MTAC) to oversee planning and budgeting issues related to technology. Utilizing a quasi-experimental pre-post design, this study analyzed teacher attitude changes for treatment and comparison groups over year-one. Attitude and instructional practices were compared with pre-measure data to assess a baseline comparison of groups. Changes in group scores over time were conducted using RMANCOVA and differences were found between groups for two attitude subscales and for four instructional practices. The largest effect was found for technology implementation. Exploratory hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to assess the predictive relationship between attitude subscales and technology implementation. Only teachers?

Probabilistic analysis provides decision-makers with quantitative information about the confidence with which an emission factor may be used. Variability refers to the heterogeneity of a quantity with respect to time, space, or different members of a population. Uncertainty refers to the lack of knowledge regarding the true value of an empirical quantity. Ignorance of the distinction between variability and uncertainty may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding emission factor and emission inventory. This dissertation extensively and systematically discusses methodologies associated with quantification of variability and uncertainty in the development of emission factors and emission inventory, including the method based upon use of mixture distribution and the method for accounting for the effect of measurement error on variability and uncertainty analysis. A general approach for developing a probabilistic emission inventory is presented. A few example case studies were conducted to demonstrate the methodologies. The case studies range from utility power plant emission source to highway vehicle emission sources. A prototype software tool, AUVEE, was developed to demonstrate the general approach in developing a probabilistic emission inventory based upon an example utility power plant emission source. A general software tool, AuvTool, was developed to implement all methodologies and algorithms presented in this dissertation for variability and uncertainty analysis. The tool can be used in any quantitative analysis fields where variability and uncertainty analysis are needed in model inputs.</field><field name="date">2002-05-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05192002-201242/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and Assessment of an Active Learning environment: cAcL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;oncept &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;dvancement through &lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;hemistry &lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;aboratory-&lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;ecture</field><field name="creator">Allen, DeeDee Ann</field><field name="description">Concept Advancement through Chemistry Laboratory-Lecture, or cAcL&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, was developed to establish an active learning environment in introductory chemistry courses.

These functions, when combined with the text-based nature of the protocol, are highly CPU-intensive under a peak load. Practical limitation on the available CPU power of a single SIP server mandates that the SIP infrastructure supporting these functions be distributed over multiple servers. Existing approaches to this problem using multiple nodes for SIP processing with a shared location database or a replicated location database to distribute the load are unfortunately not scalable or fault-tolerant, incurring high maintenance and update overheads or introducing a single point of failure. This thesis presents a proof-of-concept design and analysis of a scalable, robust architecture for SIP infrastructures using a content addressable network (CAN) model, called CASIP (CAN-based SIP). The combination of CAN and SIP is highly complementary. The performance study of CASIP using an implementation using a real SIP stack and NS-2 simulations shows that the proposed system distributes the SIP processing (both location update and lookup) load of the network over multiple nodes very effectively without incurring much routing and maintenance overhead; with use of simple cache schemes, CASIP can linearly add the number of servers in proportion to the increase in the subscriber base. The study also indicates that CASIP keeps the reconfiguration overhead minimal. Furthermore, the CASIP architecture exhibits high availability: a CASIP network of 50 nodes recovers from a server crash within 5 minutes, during which only 2% of call setup requests are dropped. These features enable cost-effective, incremental deployment of SIP servers in response to the user population growth</field><field name="date">2004-06-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05192004-005845/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecule-Based Negative Differential Resistance Across a Self-Assembled Monolayer: Its Dependence on Monolayer Coverage and Tunneling Gap</field><field name="creator">Robuck, Holly Elizabeth</field><field name="description">A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was used to perform current-voltage (I-V) measurements over electroactive self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). It was hypothesized that the redox potential of an electroactive molecule influences the peak position of negative differential resistance (NDR). For this research, a ferrocene terminated alkanethiol, a ferrocenyl-ketone terminated alkanethiol, and a methyl viologen terminated alkanethiol were used, giving a range of redox potentials. Variability from the tip and the sample made the detection of any discernable differences impossible in the NDR peak position when the different SAMs were used. To address the variability, experiments were conducted where the order of the SAM was increased. The STM tip was also coated with 2,2,2-trifluoroethanethiol to make the tip surface more homogeneous. The results of the experiments discussed in this thesis suggest that the mechanism that leads to NDR is much more complicated than the resonant tunneling model suggests.</field><field name="date">2004-06-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05192004-143129/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Part-Time Faculty on First Semester Freshmen Retention: A Predictive Model Using Logistic Regression.</field><field name="creator">Hinz, Derik Michael</field><field name="description">This study used data from five years of first-semester entering freshmen cohorts (1999-2003) from North Carolina State University to assess the effects of exposure to part-time faculty upon student retention.

EMAL (Enzymatic Mild Acidolysis Lignin) from hardwood and softwood were isolated and an additional method for the complete dissolution of such biopolymers in THF was further developed. Once the challenge of the measurement procedures were worked out, some rather accurate dn/dC values for lignin solutions were obtained as a function of time.

Critics charge that critical pedagogy is marred by irreconcilable contradictions such as its inappropriateness for non-oppressed students, its neglect of students? needs, and its unsuitability for most instructors privileged by the dominant ideology. Examining the internal consistency of Kenneth Burke?s pentadic ratios can be a useful tool for analyzing these contradictions, specifically those related to scene-act, agent-purpose, and act-agent. However, these contradictions, inherent in the very nature of critical pedagogy, seem to defy Burke?s pentad. Without inconsistencies between critical pedagogy, its purpose, its agents, and the broader scene in which it operates, the impetus for the enactment of critical pedagogy would not be present. Therefore, instead of seeking to deny or eradicate contradiction, critical theorists and educators need to make use of it in their own philosophies and practices. Because both critical educators and their students should confront and grapple with these contradictions in critical practice, the apparent flaws in critical pedagogy can actually encourage the critical consciousness that is the goal of the enterprise.</field><field name="date">2003-06-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05202003-131348/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamically Reconfigurable Intrusion Detection System</field><field name="creator">Prasad, Praveen</field><field name="description">This dissertation implements a Network Based Intrusion Detection System on a Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture.

Scanning probe microscopy techniques have been a key goal in achieving this challenge. This work begins with an exhaustive review of scanning probe lithography techniques using self-assembled monolayer (SAM) systems reported in the literature to date. Experimental study describes the development of a scanning probe lithography technique (termed replacement lithography) in which an STM tip selectively desorbs organothiolate SAMs in a predefined pattern, allowing a replacement thiol to adsorb onto the exposed gold in the patterned region. The replacement parameters were investigated using electroactive containing replacement thiol species because they displayed large apparent height contrasts in STM images, allowing the efficacy of the pattern to be easily ascertained. These data were subsequently employed to create mesoscale chemical gradients with replacement lithography. The electronic properties of redox active SAMs were also shown to display negative differential resistance in current-voltage measurements, a behavior that has possible utility in the development of ME devices. Temporal investigations monitoring the stochastic variation in apparent height contrasts in STM images of electroactive containing SAM guest species isolated within insulating host SAM matrices was also studied. The observations from these data may lend insight to how ME candidates might behave when sandwiched in a two-electrode configuration (metal-SAM-metal junction).</field><field name="date">2004-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05202004-122633/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Molecular Analysis of Nitric Oxide Synthase During Bacterial Infection of Pea (Pisum sativum L.)</field><field name="creator">Wong, Mui-Yun</field><field name="description">Nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species are two key components in the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) during plant defense against pathogen infection. In animal cells, the production of NO is catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Although NOS activity has been documented in plants, the process of NO synthesis in plants is not well understood. Isolation of the NOS protein and/or cloning of the corresponding gene will greatly facilitate the understanding of NO synthesis and its role in plant defense. The objectives of this research were to analyze the physiological and biochemical properties of a NOS-like protein (peaNOS) of pea (Pisum sativum L.), to purify and characterize peaNOS, and to clone the gene(s) encoding peaNOS and relate its expression to NOS activity in pea-bacteria interactions. The application of abiotic agents that induce systemic defense in plants [copper chloride, Actiguard&#210;, Triton-X100 and salicylic acid (SA)] to pea leaves did not induce NOS activity and verified reports that NO and NOS function upstream of SA in the signaling pathway of defense responses. Maximum (two-fold) NOS activity was detected three hours before the onset of HR in pea leaves infiltrated with incompatible bacteria (Ralstonia solanacearum), which is consistent with the effect of NO in the activation of HR after interaction with H2O2. The compatible bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae pv pisi) induced NOS activity significantly, suggesting that NO generation may also be a general response to biotic stress in plants. Antibodies raised against mammalian NOS did not have apparent specificity and utility for isolating peaNOS and should be used with caution in non-mammalian systems. The peaNOS protein was most efficiently extracted under alkaline conditions (pH 8.5 and 9.0) as compared to the neutral conditions (pH 7.4-7.5) in animal systems. Precipitation of the peaNOS protein with various concentrations of ammonium sulfate, sodium citrate and sodium chloride caused rapid loss of NOS activity. The peaNOS protein did not bind to 2',5'-ADP-Sepharose and calmodulin (CaM)-agarose indicating that the protein lacks binding sites for NADPH and CaM. Cloning of a peaNOS gene based on mammalian NOS was unsuccessful suggesting that the structure of peaNOS gene may be significantly different from mammalian NOS. Analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome database identified two gene sequences related to animal NOS, i.e., accessions At4g09680 (similar to NOS of Rattus norvegicus) and At3g47450 (similar to NOS of Helix pomatia). Gene At4g09680 is probably not expressed since attempts to clone cDNA of this gene using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) consistently failed, even when RNA of Arabidopsis was used as a template. A potential expressed peaNOS gene was successfully cloned using RNA template of pea HR tissues in RT-PCR. The 784-bp peaNOS cDNA sequence had 50% nucleotide identity to the At3g47450 coding sequence and had no other significant match in the database. The correlation of the gene expression of P protein of glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) of pea (peaP) and NOS activity during HR in pea was not demonstrated here but peaP gene was highly expressed concomitant with NOS activity during disease development. The NOS-like protein involved in NO production during HR in pea appears to be more related to At3g47450 sequence, and is possibly encoded partially by the cloned 784-bp pea cDNA.</field><field name="date">2004-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05202004-173922/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological and Genetic Description of the Freshwater Mussel, Elliptio complanata (Lightfoot, 1786) in the Cape Fear River System, N.C.</field><field name="creator">Molina, Reverie Alvarez</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to provide a preliminary description of the morphological and genetic variation of a cosmopolitan freshwater mussel E. complanata from one North Carolina river system, Cape Fear River (CFR). Individuals from CFR were collected and compared with known specimens of E. complanata (topotype). Multivariate analyses, such as factor and discriminant analyses were utilized to differentiate the individuals based on thirty morphological shell landmarks. Genetic analyses involved the use of diversity estimates and cluster analyses based on cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprint data. Factor analysis suggest that E. complanata from CFR maybe differentiated based on the thickness of posterior and anterior shell angles, and obesity of the shells. Significant differences between the CFR samples and topotypes were demonstrated by discriminant analysis of morphological data and by COI gene diversity estimates. This difference corroborated earlier work suggesting geographic delineation of E. complanata shell form. Genomic fingerprinting suggests further variation even within the topotypes. Phenotype of the topotypic materials seems to support this genomic variability. Heirarchical cluster analyses of morphometry and genetic data further showed different groups supporting earlier research suggesting high form variation within the E. complanata species.</field><field name="date">2004-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05202004-184213/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil Tests for Corn Nitrogen Recommendations and Their Relationships with Soil and Landscape Properties.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Jared Dewey</field><field name="description">An accurate soil nitrogen (N) test is needed to improve corn production, profitability, and reduce environmental concerns of increasing nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) levels in groundwater. The objectives of this study were to (i) compare soil N tests: amino sugar N (ASN), gas pressure (GP), pre-plant NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PPNT), and incubation and residual N (IRN) for precision and ability to predict corn response parameters e.g., economic optimum N rates (EONR); and (ii) examine the spatial relationships of ASN with soil and landscape properties to develop a more efficient sampling strategy. Small-plot N-response trials (NRT) were conducted in 2001 to 2004 at 31 sites. Field scale (FS) ASN variability was measured in 2003 and 2004 at four sites located in the North Carolina Piedmont and Coastal Plain. The ASN test had lower coefficients of variation than the GP, PPNT, and IRN tests (10 versus 15, 30, 52%, respectively). Each tests was correlated with economic optimum N rates from NRT sites, but coefficients of determination were low for the PPNT, IRN, and GP tests. The ASN test had the strongest correlation with EONR, but only when sites were classified as well (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.85) or poorly (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.78) drained. A comparison of ASN and EONR regression models across years and cost ratios (different corn price and fertilizer cost) were not statistically different. Amino sugar N was positively correlated with humic matter (HM; r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.25 to 0.71) at each FS sites. Elevation was negatively correlated with ASN at the Lower and Middle Coastal Plain (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.44 and 0.11, respectively). In the Piedmont, ASN was negatively correlated with slope (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.10 and 0.04). Amino sugar N was positively correlated with soil texture (percent clay) for the Middle Coastal Plain (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.56) but negatively correlated for a site in the Piedmont (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.04). Amino sugar N is spatially sensitive to changes in soil and landscape properties, and soil sampling zones may be created using HM, soil texture, and soil type to reduce sampling costs and time. These results show that the ASN test was the best test for predicting economical optimum N rates and could be used to develop a site specific soil test based fertilizer recommendation.</field><field name="date">2005-05-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05202005-073610/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Aerosol Single Scattering Albedo in the Ultraviolet Spectrum</field><field name="creator">Petters, Jonathan Leonard</field><field name="description">Single scattering albedo (omega), the ratio of scattering coefficient to total extinction coefficient, at UV wavelengths is an important aerosol radiative parameter in determining surface UV irradiance. Surface measurements of total and diffuse UV irradiance in the summer and fall of 1999 at the seven narrowband wavelength channels of an UV multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (UVMFR-SR) at Black Mountain, NC were coupled with a tropospheric ultraviolet radiative transfer model to produce values of omega. Its value ranged from 0.53 ? 0.94 at 300 nm to 0.55 ? 1.00 at 368 nm. Error in this procedure decreases with increasing aerosol optical depth (AOD), from +/-0.19 at AOD = 0.05 to +/-0.02 at AOD=1.0. Values of omega were not found to be correlated with air mass origin. The current values of omega have a wider variation than values reported from a previous study at the same site, possibly attributable to changes in aerosol chemical composition over time. The value of omega was found to be quadratically correlated with wavelength. Little research has been conducted in the scattering and absorption properties of aerosols in the UV wavelengths, but what has been done suggests such a correlation is possible. More values of omega in the UV spectrum will allow for better estimation of this parameter for UV radiative transfer modeling and will lessen error in estimation of surface UV irradiances.</field><field name="date">2002-07-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05212002-142505/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Absorbency Characteristics of Kenaf Core Particles</field><field name="creator">Zaveri, Mitul Dilip</field><field name="description">ZAVERI, MITUL DILIP. " Absorbency Characteristics of Kenaf Core Particles " (Under the direction of Dr. Behnam Pourdeyhimi). Chopped Kenaf Core (2 " to 4" in length), obtained from Greene Natural Fibers ? a company located in Snow Hill, North Carolina, was ground into very fine particles (below 1 mm) and categorized into various size ranges. The ground particles were tested for water absorbency and the optimum particle size, giving maximum absorbency, was determined. Experiments revealed that Kenaf Core of size range 106 ? 425 microns gave the highest water absorbency at saturation, up to 12 times its weight. The 425 ? 840 micron range was the next highest and it absorbed water up to 10 times its weight. Factors leading to this optimum particle size range were determined, the absorption mechanisms taking place were studied and experimental analysis was done to prove the results obtained. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were also taken to understand the shape and profile of the granular particles in fine detail. Various chemical treatment and refining experiments were carried out on the highly absorbent particle sizes (106 ? 840 microns) to enhance their bonding properties and to make handsheets from them. The highly absorbent Core particles were treated with NaOH in water bath at 90 &#186; C, Cooked with NaOH and Na2S at 170 &#186; C in a bomb reactor and treated with water in a water bath at 90 &#186; C, all for 3 hours. Handsheets were made from the chemically treated particles to determine if there was sufficient bonding between them. To enhance the bonding further, the particles were refined in a blender for one hour. The effect of chemical treatment and refining on the absorbency properties of the Core was determined. SEM analysis of the particles was done to visualize the fibrillation caused due to refining. Handsheets were made with a blend of hardwood and highly absorbent (untreated and water treated 106 ? 840 micron) refined Core particles with 50 ? 70% of Kenaf Core in them. The absorption properties of these handsheets were determined and compared with the absorption of a handsheet made from fluff pulp (same basis weight). As the final step, the handsheets made from a blend of kenaf core and hardwood pulp were sandwiched between a pair of 17gsm lightly calendared polypropylene spun bond fabrics.</field><field name="date">2004-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile and Apparel, Technology and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05212004-012719/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Clothoidal Spirals to Generate Smooth Tool Paths for High Speed Machining</field><field name="creator">Pamali, Abhinand P</field><field name="description">We present a new and innovative method to generate Contour Parallel tool paths using Clothoidal spirals for 2.5D pocket milling. The tool paths generated by the proposed method are more suitable for High Speed Machining compared to the traditional tool paths. Mechanical parts, such as those in Aerospace industry, Mold and Dies industry, etc require large volumes of milling operations. Modern High Speed CNC Machines are used in making of these parts. Although the High Speed CNC machines can provide very high spindle speed, due to various reasons, it has not been possible to use their High speed capabilities to their full extent. Two of the main reasons being, complex pocket geometry and complex tool path geometry. Most pockets are made up of sharp corners. In the traditional contour parallel pocket milling tool paths, as the cutting tool approaches these corners, they have to undergo a sudden change in directions and the acceleration of the tool has to be instantaneously decreased. Also, there is an instantaneous increase in the chip volume and the resultant forces acting on the cutting tool. In our proposed method we smooth these sharp corners of the traditional tool path by using Clothoidal spirals. The Clothoidal curves which have traditionally been used for Highways and Rail track design, have an unique property, according to which, the curvature of the Clothoidal spirals varies linearly with the length of the curve. By using these curves of uniformly varying curvature, we reduce the magnitude of the sudden direction changes that the cutting tool has to undergo at the sharp pocket corners. The cutting tool is subjected to lesser resultant forces and has a comparatively uniform acceleration. Machining time is also expected to be reduced by our proposed method.</field><field name="date">2004-05-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05212004-114758/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-a AND ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-b IN THE HYPERLUTEINIZED MOUSE OVARY</field><field name="creator">Couse, John Floyd</field><field name="description">The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis was characterized in female mice lacking one or both forms of estrogen receptor (ERa, ERb) with the aim of elucidating the contribution of each receptor form to gonadotropin homeostasis and ovarian function. These studies consisted of a thorough evaluation of gene expression for the gonadotropin subunits in the pituitary and the components necessary for steroidogenesis in the ovary. These data were corroborated with evaluations of the plasma levels for each of the relevant pituitary and gonadal hormones. Females lacking ERb (bERKO) exhibit minimal disruption in HPG axis function but do exhibit deficits in gonadotropin responsiveness in the ovary. Females lacking ERa (aERKO) exhibit dramatic ovarian phenotypes of hemorrhagic and cystic follicles and exaggerated steroid synthesis in the ovaries. The phenotypes in the aERKO ovary are attributable to chronically elevated LH due to the loss of ERa function in the hypothalamus. Pharmacologic reduction of plasma LH levels in aERKO females abates the ovarian phenotypes. These studies indicate that the hypothalamic functions of ERa are most critical to ovarian function. To better understand the contribution of ERb to the manifestations of LH-hyperstimulation in the ovary, females lacking functional ERb but possessing elevated LH via a transgene (bERKOLHCTP) were generated. Characterization of bERKOLHCTP animals indicates the intraovarian functions of ERb are necessary for the induction of LH-associated cystic follicles but not amplified steroidogenesis. An additional novel finding in aERKO ovaries was ectopic expression of the Leydig cell specific enzyme, 17b-HSD III and correlating male-like testosterone synthesis. This phenotype is dependent on LH-hyperstimulation of ovaries lacking ERa function to manifest. In summary, the predominant contribution of ERa to ovarian function occurs in the hypothalamus, whereas ERb is more important within the ovary itself. Presence of Leydig cell specific gene expression in aERKO ovaries indicates a potential role for estradiol and ERa in gonadal differentiation.</field><field name="date">2004-06-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05212004-123339/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal Stability of alpha-Lactalbumin</field><field name="creator">McGuffey, Matthew Kenneth</field><field name="description">The objective of this research was to quantitatively describe the the denaturation and aggregation processes of a-lactalbumin at neutral pH in order to understand their interrelationship and effect on solution stability. Three different preparations of a-La had similar denaturation temperatures, enthalpies and % reversibility as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. However, Native PAGE reveled three non-native monomer bands that corresponded to three distinct dimer bands indicating specific intramolecular disulfide bond shuffling leads to formation of disulfide-specific dimers. The apo protein was the most thermostable to turbidity development. The Ca-La was the most thermostable holo- preparation. Turbidity development at 95 degreesC (95 degrees C) indicated pure preparations intensely associate through hydrophobic interactions through bridging by divalent phosphate and this effect was mitigated by decreasing the ionic strength, decreasing the phosphate charge to &#161;V1 (at pH 6.6) or decreasing the temperature. The aggregation behavior of a commercial a-La was investigated at neutral pH and 95?aC in a complex mineral salt environment to understand general stability factors involved in a nutritional beverage. The objective was to understand the effect of a-La lot variation, relative b-lactoglobulin concentration and excess calcium on the aggregate size development as measured by light scattering and turbidity development. The lot of holo-a-La possessing a higher intrinsic b-Lg concentration had higher solubility at pH 6.80, evolved more reactive thiol groups, had a 25% faster first order rate constant, dissociated only slightly with cooling and formed spherical aggregates with a much higher molecular weight. Aggregates intrinsic to the protein powder may play a role in aggregate growth and shape. Adding increasing quantities of b-Lg generally decreased solubility. The highest b-Lg concentrations investigated demonstrated a net thiol oxidation and, subsequently, had a diminished ability to aggregate through hydrophobic interactions. Adding excess calcium caused a dramatic loss of solubility at pH 7.0 and required an increase in pH to 7.5 to regain solubility.</field><field name="date">2004-08-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05212004-155321/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boron Deficiency and Chilling Injury Interactions in Tobacco Transplants Grown in the Float System</field><field name="creator">Overstreet, Laura Flint</field><field name="description">Decades of agricultural research have failed to determine the precise mechanisms of infliction caused by the conditions of boron deficiency and chilling injury. Both conditions affect the quality and marketability of tobacco transplants grown in the float system. Interestingly, boron deficiency and chilling injury produce strikingly similar symptoms in young tobacco transplants; so similar, in fact, that they are often confused for one another. This has lead to severe boron toxicity when growers treated chilling injury as boron deficiency by applying boron to non-deficient float beds. The observation of nearly identical symptoms suggests that boron deficiency and chilling injury have interdependent effects on cell physiology and/or metabolism. Because little research has been conducted on tobacco transplants in the float system, two studies were conducted to determine general parameters for the boron deficiency threshold and effect of non-optimal temperatures and large day/night temperature differentials in this system. The boron deficiency study established that the deficiency threshold for transplants growing at 26/22&#186; C is 10-20 &#181;g B g-1 dry matter. These tissue levels occurred with solution concentrations of 0.19-1.9 &#181;M B. The chilling injury study determined that root and shoot growth of flue-cured cultivars is near maximum at a constant 26/26&#186; C temperature regime. Burley cultivars display a wider range of temperature tolerance, but in general constant day/night temperatures seem to provide the greatest shoot tissue accumulation. A reduction in night temperature resulted in decreased shoot growth in all cultivars. The chilling injury study also examined the effect of boron deficient conditions at each temperature treatment. In general, boron uptake declined at sub-optimal temperature regimes when supplied at concentrations sufficient for near-optimal temperatures. Shoot growth of flue-cured varieties at transplant stage was near maximal at a constant optimal day/night temperature regime (26/26&#186; C) and adequate B concentrations. Sub-optimal temperatures may alter the boron deficiency threshold such that it decreases with decreasing temperatures or with stressful temperature differentials. This may be summarized in the following way: Temperature is the immediate limiting factor in tobacco transplant growth in the float system under conditions of sub-optimal temperatures and low B concentration, and B deficiency is an additional potential limiting factor.</field><field name="date">2002-05-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05222002-141629/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated Method For Fiber Length Measurement</field><field name="creator">Tompkins, Michael</field><field name="description">The price of cotton is dictated by quality and the most significant factor of contributing to the fiber quality is the length distribution of the fibers contained within the population. Therefore it is of importance to accurately and repeatably measure the length of fibers within a population so that it is graded properly. Current methods are inadequate and thus prior work focused on designing a machine to directly measure individual cotton fibers using digital imaging. The current work begins with the evaluation of the effectiveness of the digital imaging machine. The machine was evaluated and sources of error identified. Modifications were implemented in an attempt to improve the error. After multiple modifications with little success an entirely new design was conceptualized. The new design aimed to eliminate all major sources of error with the existing machine while not creating new sources of error. The new design is discussed and the results are compared to those obtained by the original imaging machine. The new machine was better able to accurately measure the length of cut length fibers. The variation between fibers within a sample and entire samples of cut length fiber was significantly decreased when compared to the variation of the previous system.</field><field name="date">2006-08-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05222006-130435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relation of Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity to Basic Early Literacy Skills</field><field name="creator">Asbeck, Stephanie Ann</field><field name="description">This study examined the relationship of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity to phonemic awareness and mastery of the alphabetic principle in kindergarten children.

It was predicted that classroom behaviors related to the two dimensions of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) would be negatively related to children?s acquisition of both early literacy skills. After controlling for demographic differences and classroom assignment, multiple regression analyses indicated that inattention was negatively related to children?s mastery of the alphabetic principle.

Merr.] by citrate secretion from roots, leading to external complexation of toxic Al species in solution, is enhanced by addition of &amp;mu;M Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to hydroponic solutions. The objectives of this dissertation were to assess ameliorative effects of &amp;mu;M Mg additions on soybean root growth in acidic subsoils and to relate the soil solution ionic compositions to soybean root growth. Roots of soybean cultivar Plant Introduction 416937 extending from a limed surface soil compartment grew for 28 days into a subsurface compartment containing acid subsoils [Cecil (oxidic and kaolinitic), Creedmoor (montmorillonitic) and Norfolk (kaolinitic)]. The three Mg treatments consisted of the native equilibrium soil solution concentrations in each soil (50 or 100 &amp;mu;M) and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; additions to achieve 150 and 300 &amp;mu;M Mg (Mg150, Mg300, respectively) in the soil solutions. Root elongations into Mg-treated subsoils were compared with a CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; treatment limed to achieve a soil pH value of 5.5. Subsoil root length for the treatments without added Mg or lime decreased in the order of the Cecil followed by Norfolk and Creedmoor subsoils, and corresponded to the increasing order of percent Al saturation (27, 61 and 83%, respectively). Subsoil root growth and dry matter responses to the Mg treatments were less than the lime treatments, and there were no differences for the Mg150 and Mg300 treatments as compared to the treatments without added Mg or lime. Citrate adsorption experiments found that over 66% citrate added in the subsoils were adsorbed and biodegraded, suggesting that root secreted citrate in the soil might readily be unavailable to complex Al for ameliorating its rhizotoxicity. Root length relative to the limed treatments for all subsoils (RRL) was poorly related to the activity of soil solution Al species (Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Al-hydroxyl species) and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the RRL values were more closely related to the parameters associated with soil solution Ca activity including Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/(Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), suggesting that Ca could be a primary factor ameliorating Al and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; rhizotoxicity in these subsoils. Increased tolerance to Al rhizotoxicity of soybean by &amp;mu;M Mg additions to hydroponic solutions, inducing citrate secretion from roots to externally complex toxic Al species, may be less important in the acid subsoil with a poor native Ca available to root growth.</field><field name="date">2006-05-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05222006-212404/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction of Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors and Atherosclerosis in Male Syrian Golden Hamsters by Peanuts, Peanut Oil and Fat Free Peanut Flour</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Amanda Mae</field><field name="description">Studies have demonstrated the cardiovascular protective properties of peanuts and peanut oil through the reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) while maintaining healthy levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The cardiovascular protective effects of fat free peanut flour have never been evaluated despite the fact flour contains arginine, flavonoids, folates and other compounds beneficial to cardiovascular health. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting unsaturated fatty acids and arginine may promote bone strength. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of fat free peanut flour and other peanut components on plasma cholesterol risk factors for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis and bone strength in male Syrian golden hamsters. Seventy-six hamsters were randomly divided into four groups and each group was fed a different isocaloric diet for twenty-four weeks. Each experimental diet was a modification of the high fat and high cholesterol control diet. Modifications to the control diet were made by substituting fat free peanut flour (&lt;0.5% oil), peanut oil or whole peanuts for similar metabolic components. Randomly selected hamsters from each diet group were euthanized at 0, 12, 18 and 24 weeks at which point blood plasma, aortas and femurs were collected. Plasma was analyzed for total plasma cholesterol (TPC) and lipoprotein distribution by high-performance gel chromatography. Aortic total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC) and cholesteryl ester (CE), a metabolic atherosclerosis indicator, were determined as mg/g protein. Hamsters consuming diets containing fat free peanut flour, peanut oil or whole peanuts had significantly lower TPC and LDL-C than the control group. There were no significant differences in HDL-C among any of the diet groups. Aortic TC, FC and CE were significantly lower in the fat free flour, peanut oil and peanut diet group hamsters compared to those in the control group. Results indicated peanuts, peanut oil and fat free peanut flour in diets reduced blood chemistry risk factors and slowed the development of atherosclerosis, as indicated by low levels of CE, in male Syrian golden hamsters fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet. The results for bone strength were variable and overall the effects of fat free peanut flour, peanut oil and whole peanuts on bone strength were inconclusive.</field><field name="date">2008-05-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05222008-160514/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonvolatile Spin Memory based on Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor and Hybrid Semiconductor Ferromagnetic Nanostructures</field><field name="creator">Enaya, Hani</field><field name="description">The feasibility of nonvolatile spin-based memory device concepts is explored. The first memory device concept utilizes the electrically controlled paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in a diluted magnetic semiconductor layer (quantum well or dot) when the ferromagnetism in the diluted magnetic semiconductor is mediated by itinerant holes. The specific structure under consideration consists of a diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum well (or quantum dot) and a nonmagnetic quantum well, which acts as a hole reservoir, separated by a permeable barrier. The quantitative analysis is done by calculating the free energy of the system. Formation of two stable states at the same external conditions, i.e., bistability, is found feasible at temperatures below the Curie temperature with proper band engineering. The effects of scaling the magnetic quantum well to quantum dot on bistability are analyzed. The bit retention time, i.e., lifetime, with respect to spontaneous leaps between the two stable states is calculated. The write/erase and read operations are discussed as well as the dissipation energy. Also, potential logic operations are proposed. In the second memory concept, the active region is a semiconductor quantum dot sharing an interface with a dielectric magnetic layer. The operating principle of the device is based on the spontaneous magnetic symmetry breaking due to exchange interaction between the magnetic ions in the magnetic layer and the spins of the itinerant holes in the quantum dot. Room temperature operation is possible given the availability of insulating ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic materials whose Curie temperature is above room temperature. The specific range of material parameters where bistability is achieved is found. Analysis is extended to different quantum dot and magnetic dielectric materials and designs. Influence of material choice and design on the memory robustness, i.e., lifetime, is discussed.</field><field name="date">2008-06-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05222008-214407/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological and Property Analyses of Multicomponent Block Copolymer Nanocomposites Gels</field><field name="creator">van Maanen, Guillermo Jose</field><field name="description">Thermoplastic elastomer gels (TPEGs), molecular networks composed of a microphase-separated multiblock copolymer swollen to a large extent by a low-volatility midblock-selective solvent, are ubiquitous in a wide range of contemporary technologies, including home and office products, athletic equipment and telecommunications devices. In this work, we investigate the effect of several network-forming nanoscale modifiers ? two different silica nanoparticles, 3 different nanoclays, a multiwalled carbon nanotube and a semicrystalline homopolymer ? on the property development of a TPEG prepared from a microphase-ordered poly(styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene) (SEBS) triblock copolymer imbibed with an EB-compatible aliphatic mineral oil. Dynamic rheological measurements of the resultant nanocomposite TPEGs (NCTPEGs) confirm that addition of these modifiers tends to increase the linear viscoelastic threshold, the dynamic elastic modulus (G') and the flow onset temperature (where G' plummets) of the parent TPEG. Variable-temperature stress-relaxation studies indicate that these NCTPEGs undergo substantial relaxation irrespective of added modifier at temperatures above ~60&#176;C. Complementary x-ray diffraction analysis reveals that the nanoclay particles used to generate three series of the NCTPEGs examined here are swollen with copolymer and/or solvent and are therefore intercalated.</field><field name="date">2004-05-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05242004-083438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring Duckweed (Lemna gibba) as a Protein Supplement for Ruminants Using the Boer Goat (Capra hircus) as a Model</field><field name="creator">Reid, Wayne Stanley Jr.</field><field name="description">Duckweed is the common name used to refer to members of the aquatic plant family Lemnaceae. Duckweed commonly grows on stagnant, nutrient enriched waters throughout tropical and temperate zones. Growth conditions include water temperatures of 6 ? 33&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and a wide pH range. Under ideal conditions, duckweed can double its biomass every sixteen hours to four days. Its nutrient uptake capability helps to account for a CP of 15 ? 40% and high growth rate. Scientists have studied duckweed?s feed attributes for fish, poultry, swine, and ruminants. A duckweed feeding trial was carried out at North Carolina State University Metabolism Educational Unit with 19 goat wethers fed four different diets. The objective of the trial was to characterize the composition of wastewater grown duckweed and evaluate its use as a protein supplement for ruminants. Our hypothesis was that duckweed is a suitable protein source for goats and will behave in a similar fashion to soybean meal. The diets included a negative control, positive control (all of the supplemental protein from soybean meal), 1/3 duckweed, and 2/3 duckweed (1/3 and 2/3 of the supplemental protein came from duckweed, respectively). The goats were fed equal amounts of hay and supplement at 4% of body weight (as fed). Duckweed exhibited a similar compositional profile to soybean meal except for being lower in CP and higher in minerals. Amino acid and protein fraction profiles were also comparable between duckweed and soybean meal. There was no significant difference among treatments for DMI, ADF, and NDF digestibility. Nitrogen intake, N digested (g/d), and N retained (% of digested) showed no significant differences among the supplemental protein diets. Nitrogen retained as a percent of intake and N retained (g/d) tended to be slightly lower in the diets containing duckweed. Serum urea nitrogen levels also showed no significant differences for the protein diets except for a linear response (P = 0.09). The P balance showed no significant difference for P intake but both linear and quadratic responses for P retained (g/d), and P digested (g/d) as well as a linear response for P retained (% of digested). Similarities of the rumen pH, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and VFA data among the diets show that duckweed does not abnormally affect rumen function and is comparable to soybean meal in dietary function. Duckweed appears to be a viable source of protein and phosphorus (at lower dietary levels) supplementation for ruminants and is nearly comparable to soybean meal in its utilization.</field><field name="date">2004-05-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05242004-103543/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELING AND COMPUTING FOR LAYERED PAVEMENTS UNDER VEHICLE LOADING</field><field name="creator">Xu, Qingxia</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to develop and implement some numerical models to analyze pavement responses under vehicle loading. Firstly, to study the pavement delamination problem, the pavement structure is modeled as an elastic finite layer system subjected to vertical and horizontal loadings over circular areas. By using the finite layer method, the maximum interface shear stress are determined; the maximum interface shear stress can be used to compare with the interface shear strength obtained through simple shear testing to determine reasonable pavement design parameters to prevent delamination failure. Secondly, the responses of a linear viscoelastic pavement system, with asphalt concrete layer of viscoelastic properties, subjected to vertical circular loadings, are analyzed by finite element method using three algorithms: (i) direct time integration; (ii) Fourier transform; (iii) Laplace transform. The inverse Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and the numerical inversion of Laplace transform method of Honig and Hirdes are used. The numerical results of the quasi-static responses by the three algorithms are presented and compared with respect to their accuracy and computational efficiency. To use the viscoelastic model in the pavement analysis, the parameters of the generalized Maxwell model based on the frequency sweep test results are determined by using the software IRIS, which is then assigned as the property of the asphalt concrete layer in a typical pavement structure subjected to a standard dual tire axle loading. Results for the distributions of stress and strain at various times are presented. In the last part of the research, a preliminary study is presented for permanent deformation of asphalt concrete. A simplified one-dimensional elasto-visco-plastic model is implemented and used to analyze the visco-plastic deformation of a cylindrical asphalt concrete sample under one-dimensional loading.</field><field name="date">2004-05-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05252004-152145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless MAC Protocol Design and Analysis</field><field name="creator">Jang , Beakcheol</field><field name="description">Wireless networks are becoming very common due to their advantages such as rapid deployment and support for mobility. In this dissertation, we design and analyze the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol for two popular wireless networks: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). For WSNs, we design and analyze an energy efficient MAC protocols. Energy efficiency is a key design factor of a MAC protocol for WSNs. Existing preamble-sampling based MAC protocols have large overheads due to their preambles and are inefficient at large wakeup intervals. Synchronous scheduling MAC protocols minimize the preamble by combining preamble sampling and scheduling techniques; however, they do not prevent energy loss due to overhearing. In this dissertation, we present an energy efficient MAC protocol for WSNs, called AS-MAC, that avoids overhearing and reduces contention and delay by asynchronously scheduling the wakeup time of neighboring nodes. We also provide a multi-hop energy consumption model for AS-MAC. To validate our design and analysis, we implement the proposed scheme on the MICAz and TELOSB platforms. Experimental results show that AS-MAC considerably reduces energy consumption, packet loss and delay when compared with other energy efficient MAC protocols. For WLANs, we present a saturation throughput model for IEEE 802.11, the standard of WLAN, for a simple infrastructure scenario with hidden stations. Despite the importance of the hidden terminal problem, there have been a relatively small number of studies that consider the effect of hidden terminals on IEEE 802.11 throughput. Moreover, existing models are not accurate for scenarios with the short-term unfairness. In this dissertation, we present a new analytical saturation throughput model for IEEE 802.11 for a simple but typical infrastructure scenario with small number of hidden stations. Simulation results are used to validate the model and show that our model is extremely accurate. Lastly, we provide a saturation throughput model for IEEE 802.11 for the general infrastructure scenario with hidden stations. Simulation results show that this generalized model is reasonably accurate.</field><field name="date">2009-06-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05262009-175059/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing Intraindividual Variability on Neuropsychological Assessments in African American Older Adults</field><field name="creator">Gamaldo, Alyssa Ann</field><field name="description">The current investigation examined intraindividual variability and predictors of this variability on neuropsychological measures. A total of 50 (39 women and 11 men) independently living, community-dwelling African Americans ranging in age from 50 to 80 years (M = 65.40, SD = 8.53) were asked to complete measures assessing socio-demographics, physical health (i.e. blood pressure and sleep), and cognitive functioning (i.e. executive function, memory, perceptual speed, constructions, and language) over 8 occasions within a 2-3 week period. The current study observed intraindividual variability across the neuropsychological measures. Results from multilevel modeling suggested that a within-person change in systolic blood pressure was positively associated with performance on executive function (e.g., Letter Fluency), particularly for those participants who on average had high systolic blood pressure and high stress. In contrast, a within-person change in sleep duration was associated with worse performance on constructions and executive functioning (e.g., Letter Fluency). Results also reflected a significant interaction between within-person change in sleep duration and average sleep duration for both perceptual speed (e.g., Number Comparison test) and executive function (e.g., Stroop task). Individuals with low sleep duration on average tended to perform poorly, particularly on those occasions when their sleep duration was below their personal average. In contrast, individuals with high sleep duration on average tended to perform poorly, particularly on those occasions when their sleep duration was above their personal average. Furthermore, daily fluctuations in sleep duration were associated with an increased risk for classification of mild cognitive impairment. The results suggest that variability on neuropsychological measures may be a useful clinical assessment of older African Americans&#226; cognitive competency.</field><field name="date">2009-06-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05262009-230637/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Cognition as a Mediator in the Relationship between Disability Status and Social Status</field><field name="creator">Andreassi, Cristina Lynne</field><field name="description">This study examined the relationship between social-cognitive ability and social status in children with and without learning disabilities. Social cognitive mapping was used to determine children?s centrality in the social network in their classroom and accuracy in reporting peer social networks. It was predicted that social cognition, as assessed through the accuracy measure, would mediate differences in social status, as assessed through social network centrality. Although children with learning disabilities had lower social network centrality, they did not differ from children without learning disabilities in terms of accuracy in reporting social networks in the classroom. Therefore, the mediation model was not supported. However, greater accuracy in reporting peer networks was predictive of greater peer involvement across both groups of children. Results are discussed in terms of implications for improving children?s social functioning and future research on the topics of the social functioning and social cognition of children with learning disabilities.</field><field name="date">2004-05-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05282004-141603/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and Characterization of Aluminum-Steel Composite Metal Foams</field><field name="creator">Vendra, Lakshmi Jyotshna</field><field name="description">Composite Metal Foam (CMF), a new material belonging to the class of advanced cellular and porous materials, has been successfully processed using Gravity Casting technique for the first time at NC State University. This material comprises of steel hollow spheres and a solid Aluminum alloy matrix. The complete characterization of the material included mechanical testing such as monotonic compression, compression-compression fatigue, micro hardness, nano hardness and higher strain rate compression. The energy absorption behavior of the material under static compression has been studied extensively. Experimental results show that Al-steel CMF not only has a higher energy absorption capability than that of other commercially available metal foams produced from similar materials, but also possess a higher strength to density ratio. The microstructural analysis of the material was used to study and explain the formation of different phases at the Aluminum-Steel interface and their effect on the deformation behavior of the composite foam under compression. The effect of processing temperature on the microstructure of the composite metal foam and specifically on the sphere-matrix interface was studied by experimental means. The mechanical properties of the ternary phases formed in the microstructure of the composite foam were characterized using micro and nano-hardness tests. The phases were chemically characterized and formulated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy analysis and Al-Fe-Si alloy ternary phase diagrams. The fatigue behavior of the composite metal foams was studied under compression-compression fatigue loading and the results were compared with those of other closed cell metal foams. The elastic modulus of the foams was evaluated using experimental and analytical techniques and the results were found to be in good agreement. Composite metal foams were also processed using a higher solidification rate with water cooling. The effect of alterations in microstructure on the mechanical properties of the composite metal foams was studied and results presented. As the result of high strength, the increase in energy absorption of the composite metal foam samples ranges over thirty times compared to that of 100% Al foams and over six times compared to that of 100% steel foams.</field><field name="date">2008-06-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05282008-163908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispositional Influences and Individual Differences in Work Performance: Relationships of Goal Orientation, Growth Need Strength, and Conscientiousness.</field><field name="creator">Dierdorff, Erich Clinton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the roles of dispositional variables in affecting work performance. Study participants were criminal investigators from a state bureau of investigation (N = 158). The predictive potentials of growth need strength (GNS), learning orientation, performance orientation, and Conscientiousness were examined using structural equation modeling in relation to multidimensional work performance. All scales used for the study?s constructs were subjected to a tetrad analysis prior to modeling in order to ensure unidimensional congeneric indicator sets. Three job performance constructs were incorporated: task performance as rating data, task performance as work activity data, and citizenship performance as rating data. GNS was shown to predict work activity task performance. Conscientiousness was found to predict citizenship performance. Learning orientation predicted both work activity task performance and citizenship performance, however the directions of the relationships were negative. Performance orientation was not found to predict any performance construct. None of the dispositional constructs predicted task performance as derived from ratings. Of the predictors, GNS and learning orientation displayed the highest latent correlation due to their similar conceptualizations. Using different operationalizations and sources for the latent performance criteria increased their measurement distinctiveness, as well as revealing differential predictive validities. The implications of these predictive validities and the importance of using a multidimensional approach to performance in future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2002-06-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05292002-203253/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Her cradle, and his sepulchre": The Shelleys' Anxiety of Creation and Identity</field><field name="creator">bolte, Caralyn Marie</field><field name="description">Both Percy Shelley and Mary Wollestonecraft Shelley asserted their belief in the nature of literature to transcend conscious thoughts and to operate as a dream state, manifesting unconscious fears and desires. By analyzing two primary works by the Shelleys as dreams, and applying Freud?s theories of dream interpretation and the unconscious, this thesis reveals how these works demonstrate a shared unconscious anxiety about the transformative nature of creation and its power to establish or destroy identity. In Alastor, Percy Shelley manifests his anxiety about his relationship with artistic creation through his treatment of gender, most especially in his description of and interaction with the veiled maid. Alastor demonstrates Shelley?s conflicting desire both to unite with the powerful creative force and to reject it in order to maintain his own socially constructed role as male Romantic Poet. In Frankenstein, Mary Shelley both responds to and expands upon the thematic focus established by Percy Shelley in Alastor. Focusing on the power of physical creation to redefine a woman?s identity, Mary Shelley manifests her anxiety about the possibility of integrating the dueling aspects of her own identity, mother and author, into one cohesive identity. Percy examines how his desire for pure poetic expression affects his role within a masculine construct, while Mary interrogates her own beliefs about integrating the role of mother and author into one cohesive identity in a world that privileges and requires motherhood. Their creation of marginalized, exiled characters in the figures of the wandering poet, who chooses to shun society, and the monster, who is shunned by a society he deeply desires to be a part of, indicates their own fear of the consequences of societal rejection.</field><field name="date">2004-05-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05292004-121254/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring Age-Related Differences in Prospective Memory Inside and Outside of the Lab</field><field name="creator">Kim, Paul Younghoon</field><field name="description">In this study, the characteristics of the two prospective memory tasks (activity-based and event-based) were investigated both in the laboratory and a naturalistic setting with the addition of the age component.

Second, they were required to come to Crabtree Valley Mall (the naturalistic setting) a couple of days later (i.e. one particular Saturday) to complete various prospective memory tasks (i.e. finding 4 different men&#226;s shirts as well as filling out a naturalistic questionnaire and picking up debriefing statement). Results found that both age groups performed the event-based task followed by activity-based task better in the lab than in the naturalistic setting. The young participants performed the tasks better than their older counterparts in both contexts, though the effects were nonsignificant. An interesting finding was that older participants performed the naturalistic event-based task better than the young participants.

Autonomous entities often face the economic and social dilemma of whether to act in trustworthy manner. Reputation mechanisms and institutional norms are currently used to make an individual agent responsible for its actions. It is challenging to achieve trust in an anonymous setting. We consider the problem of trust with respect to fairness, especially in an anonymous setting. Decision mechanisms should be built into agents to yield trustworthy behavior. We study conditions under which such cooperation can evolve. Our simulations show that small group interactions make it favorable for fairness to emerge.

Troubleshooting faults requires analytical skills and knowledge of the system. Elementary skills help in solving common faults but faults that are infrequent or those which cannot be debugged by a consumer or even a field technician due to lack of in-depth knowledge of the system requires an expert?s intervention. Experts are not always available in the field and lack of knowledge on the field technician?s part may lead to huge financial losses and inconvenience on the part of the consumer. To avoid such situations an approach to make available expert?s knowledge and capability to the field technicians is demonstrated through this research. A qualitative modeling approach to develop a knowledge representation is outlined here. A qualitative knowledge of the system from expert?s point of view is modeled for a Bosch dishwasher for whom knowledge is extracted to generate a rule base, which reasons the characteristics of the system like an expert. Further it has been explored that using the rule base one can develop a questionnaire using the concept of model based diagnosis for troubleshooting. A qualitative model is useful for this kind of system because it resembles the analytical thinking capability of an expert and in general for any human being making it easier to communicate and interpret. Thus providing such a system to the field technician or even the consumer will simplify the troubleshooting process and will help in reducing downtime and financial losses.</field><field name="date">2006-06-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05302006-170618/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Tabu Search Approach to Multiple Sequence Alignment</field><field name="creator">Lightner, Carin Ann</field><field name="description">Sequence alignment methods are used to detect and quantify similarities between different DNA and protein sequences that may have evolved from a common ancestor. Effective sequence alignment methodologies also provide insight into the structure function of a sequence and are the first step in constructing evolutionary trees. In this dissertation, we use a tabu search approach to multiple sequence alignment. A tabu search is a heuristic approach that uses adaptive memory features to align multiple sequences. The adaptive memory feature, a tabu list, helps the search process avoid local optimal solutions and explores the solution space in an efficient manner. We develop two main tabu searches that progressively align sequences. A randomly generated bifurcating tree guides the alignment. The objective is to optimize the alignment score computed using either the sum of pairs or parsimony scoring function. The use of a parsimony scoring function provides insight into the homology between sequences in the alignment. We also explore iterative refinement techniques such as a hidden Markov model and an intensification heuristic to further improve the alignment. This approach to multiple sequence alignment provides improved alignments as compared to several other methods.</field><field name="date">2008-08-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-05312008-191232/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Code Motion Techniques for STI in BBCP</field><field name="creator">Vangara, Sunil</field><field name="description">Software thread integration (STI) helps in hardware to software migration by enabling integration of two independent software threads, which enables execution of the integrated thread in a generic processor. Automation of STI would help in obtaining efficient software versions of many hardware implemented functions. Bit banged communication protocols (BBCP) have been researched for implementation as software threads .Software integration is performed on the different threads of the implementation for obtaining efficient software versions. Though these integrated threads are efficient, these protocols include a message-level thread which is not integrated with any other threads. During integration, cocalls (coroutine calls) are introduced for context switching between integrated threads. The periodic execution requirement of cocalls results in some inefficiency introduced due to idle times introduced in the message level thread between bit level calls. We propose an optimizing algorithm to improve this and distribute the instructions in the message level thread across inter-bit calls to reduce the idle time. Our code optimization algorithm moves code from paths between inter bit calls which are larger (more execution time) to paths between inter bit calls which are smaller (lesser execution time). We adopt data flow analysis techniques similar to those used for partial redundancy elimination and dead code elimination.</field><field name="date">2003-06-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06012003-210949/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics and stock assessment of the blue crab in North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Eric Gordon</field><field name="description">The blue crab (Callinectes sapidus) is an ecologically important estuarine predator and represents North Carolina?s most important commercial fishery. Recent fishery-dependent and ?independent data suggest the population is declining. The goal of this study was to increase our understanding of the status and population dynamics of the blue crab in NC by addressing the following objectives: (1) estimate population demographics of blue crabs in salt marsh creeks, (2) construct a discontinuous model of blue crab growth in NC using growth rates estimated from free-ranging blue crabs, and (3) provide a comprehensive stock assessment for the blue crab in NC. A series of complimentary laboratory and field studies assessed the nursery role of salt marsh habitats for the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Population demographics and movement patterns of juvenile and adult blue crabs were quantified in two tidal salt marsh creeks near Beaufort, North Carolina, USA during June ? October 2001. While there are many studies that report estimates of population density, mortality rates, or movement rates for blue crabs, this study represents one of the first attempts to estimate all quantities concurrently. Juvenile crabs were mobile within the interstices of the vegetated marsh surface during flood tide, and were equally distributed buried in intertidal marsh and adjacent mud areas during ebb tide. Juvenile crabs may experience a spatial refuge from cannibalism in the marsh surface since adult conspecifics are physically impeded by dense vegetation and rarely move far into marsh habitats. This spatial refuge in the vegetated marsh surface may be significant, since cannibalism represents a large source of mortality for this species. The relatively high use of the marsh surface by juvenile blue crabs, combined with a general lack of sampling these complex habitats, suggest that crab densities may be even higher in salt marsh systems than previously thought. Growth models commonly used in fisheries and ecological modeling assume growth is a continuous function of age. While this approach is appropriate for finfish, the validity of these models for crustacean species, which grow discontinuously, has been questioned. There is a critical need to compare the predictions of discontinuous and continuous models simultaneously to identify if potential biases are introduced by the assumption of continuous growth for the blue crab. The blue crab stock in North Carolina currently sustains heavy exploitation by the commercial fishery, and information on the recreational fishery is generally lacking. There has been a systematic increase in commercial landings from 1987-1999, followed by a period of reduced landings from 2000-2002. During this period fishery-independent indices of abundance have remained stable, or have shown a significant decline. In no case have any indices of abundance shown an increasing trend. Moreover, adult and spawning stock abundance (SSB) during 2000-2001 were at the lowest levels recorded since 1987, and the mean size of mature females has declined significantly during 1987-2003. Increases in the index of relative SSB in 2002-2003, however, may indicate a recovery. We detected a significant stock-recruit relationship for the blue crab in North Carolina using certain estimates of recruit abundance and recommend an urgent need for conservation of the spawning stock. We encourage decision makers to use the information and recommendations in this dissertation as soon as possible to manage the blue crab fishery in NC in a sustainable manner.</field><field name="date">2004-06-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06012004-095447/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Philosophical Examination of Mead's Pragmatist Constructivism as a Referent for Adult Science Education</field><field name="creator">Furbish, Dean Russel</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to examine pragmatist constructivism as a science education referent for adult learners. Specifically, this study seeks to determine whether George Herbert Mead?s doctrine, which conflates pragmatist learning theory and philosophy of natural science, might facilitate (a) scientific concept acquisition, (b) learning scientific methods, and (c) preparation of learners for careers in science and science-related areas. A philosophical examination of Mead?s doctrine in light of these three criteria has determined that pragmatist constructivism is not a viable science education referent for adult learners. Mead?s pragmatist constructivism does not portray scientific knowledge or scientific methods as they are understood by practicing scientists themselves, that is, according to scientific realism. Thus, employment of Mead?s doctrine does not adequately prepare future practitioners for careers in science-related areas. Mead?s metaphysics does not allow him to commit to the existence of the unobservable objects of science such as molecular cellulose or mosquito-borne malarial parasites. Mead?s anti-realist metaphysics also affects his conception of scientific methods. Because Mead does not commit existentially to the unobservable objects of realist science, Mead?s science does not seek to determine what causal role if any the hypothetical objects that scientists routinely posit while theorizing might play in observable phenomena. Instead, constructivist pragmatism promotes subjective epistemology and instrumental methods. The implication for learning science is that students are encouraged to derive scientific concepts based on a combination of personal experience and personal meaningfulness. Contrary to pragmatist constructivism, however, scientific concepts do not arise inductively from subjective experience driven by consummatory activity. The broader implication of this study for adult education is that the philosophically laden claims of constructivist learning theories need to be identified and assessed independently of any empirical support that these learning theories might enjoy. This in turn calls for educational experiences for graduate students of education that incorporate philosophical understanding such that future educators might be able to recognize and weigh the philosophically laden claims of adult learning theories.</field><field name="date">2005-06-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06012005-140340/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the Effects of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge on Arthropod Pests</field><field name="creator">Donohue, Kevin Vincent</field><field name="description">Atmospheric pressure plasma discharge (APPD) has been intensely studied in the past fifteen years as a method of sterilization. The effects of APPD on insects were previously unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine whether plasma could be useful for insect and mite control, determine the mode of action on arthropods, and optimize the discharge in order to achieve the shortest APPD treatment times. A positive correlation was found between exposure time to APPD and insect mortality with the level of mortality also increasing with time after treatment for western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.). Generally, mortality was negatively correlated with the weight of the insect. Cockroaches exposed to APPD for 60, 90, 120 and 180s lost on average 7.5 &#177; 0.8, 8.1 &#177; 0.6, 8.7 &#177; 0.4, and 10.1 &#177; 1.1 (&#177;1 SEM) mg of water weight, respectively, which was an increase over that of the controls. The metabolic rate of cockroaches exposed to plasma for 180 s increased from 0.80 &#177; 0.03 to 1.07 &#177; 0.04 ml of oxygen consumed mg-cockroach -1 h-1 at STP. The level of cuticular hydrocarbons identified by EI GC-MS were not significantly affected by plasma exposure in the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), German cockroach, and citrus mealybug Planococcus citri (Risso) except for a reduction in n-tritriacontane only in the latter. However, changes in the behavior of cockroaches after plasma exposure including the loss of photo-, vibro-, and thigmotropic responses, inability to right themselves, and hyperexcitatory symptoms, suggests that the site-of-action of APPD in insects is the nervous and/or neuromuscular system. The LT50 of German cockroaches, western flower thrips, and citrus mealybugs 24 h after exposure to a 37&#176;C helium discharge was 333.77, 28.72, and 999.95 s, respectively. The LT50?s 24 h after exposure to a 37&#176;C, 0.5% oxygen/99.5% helium discharge was 232.67, 19.99, &lt;13.83 s, respectively. The LT50 of German cockroaches, western flower thrips, and citrus mealybugs 24 h after exposure to the 50 &#177; 2&#176;C, helium discharge was 117.80, 13.83, and 26.62 s, respectively. No mortality resulted in German cockroaches or citrus mealybugs after exposure to a helium atmosphere followed by 50&#176;C air, however the LT50 of western flower thrips was 29.04 s, based on the mortality recorded 24 h after treatment. The addition of oxygen or heat to the discharge resulted in higher mortality in cockroaches and mealybugs but not thrips.</field><field name="date">2005-06-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06012005-215408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Quality Indicators of Visual-based Learning Material in Technology Education Programs for Grades 7-12.</field><field name="creator">Katsioloudis, Petros Joseph</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to identify the quality indicators of visual-based learning material in technology education for grades 7-12.

RQ2: What are the indicators of the learner?s characteristics that impact the selection of visual-based learning material in technology education for grades 7-12?

Yarn tensile tests demonstrated textured yarn was 70-77% lower in tensile strength, 82-85% lower in tensile modulus, and 60-190% higher in breaking strain than those of the control yarn. The results of SYC testing illustrated that the control yarn composite had only a 5% higher tensile strength, a 27% higher modulus, and 11% lower energy to break than the textured single yarn composite. Fabric tensile tests demonstrated a low initial modulus and a much larger secondary modulus for all 3D woven preforms. The ATAY fabric had a similar initial modulus and a much lower secondary modulus in the weft direction compared to the control fabric. The ATAY fabric had a significantly higher yield shear stress and strain, primary and secondary shear moduli, energy to yield point, and total energy absorbed to 4&#176; than those of the control. With the same fiber volume fraction, the ATAY composite had a slightly lower tensile strength and modulus, but a 120% higher shear modulus, than the regular aramid yarn (RAY) composite. Unlike the RAY composite brittle failure behavior, the ATAY composite failed in a ductile manner with multiple diverting cracks propagating during failure.

Behaviors that mediate interactions between organisms and their environment are complex traits that are especially sensitive to environmental conditions. Drosophila melanogaster presents an opportunity to systematically dissect epistasis and GEI, since large numbers of genetically identical individuals can be reared under defined environmental conditions. The olfactory system of Drosophila and its behavioral response to odorants have been well characterized. Previous studies on olfactory behavior have shown that the genetic architecture of this model behavior depends on epistatic networks of pleiotropic genes. I have used P-element mutagenesis in a co-isogenic background to identify genes that contribute to olfactory behavior. I have demonstrated that the effects of the transposon insertions are often dependent on developmental stage and that hypomorphic mutations in developmental genes can elicit profound adult behavioral deficits. I also assessed epistasis among these genes by constructing all possible double heterozygotes and measuring avoidance responses at two odorant concentrations. I observed enhancer and suppressor effects among subsets of these genes, and surprisingly, these epistatic interactions shifted with changes in the concentration of the olfactory stimulus. I then assessed variation in olfactory behavior in a population of 41 wild-derived inbred lines and asked to what extent different larval rearing environments would influence adult olfactory behavior and whether GEI is a minor or major contributing source of phenotypic variation. My results show that about 50% of phenotypic variation in adult olfactory behavior is attributable to GEI. In contrast, transcriptional analysis revealed that only 20 genes show GEI at the level of gene expression (FDR&lt;0.05), some of which are associated with physiological responses to environmental chemicals. Quantitative complementation tests with piggyBac-tagged mutants for two of these genes (CG9664 and Transferrin 1) demonstrate that genes that show transcriptional GEI are candidate genes for olfactory behavior, and that GEI at the level of gene expression is correlated with GEI at the level of phenotype.</field><field name="date">2008-07-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06032008-131124/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Review of the Efficacy of SAS Curriculum Pathways on Student Understanding in Chemistry.</field><field name="creator">Lamb, Richard Lawrence</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study is to review the efficacy of the SAS Curriculum Pathways (SIS) chemistry modules on student achievements in a high school academic level chemistry class.

The variety of quantitative methods that have been proposed to address environmental and water resources problems reflects the importance of this subject. In a review of the literature, methods were compared and contrasted and promising areas for future research were identified. Conclusions drawn from the review were that 1) large gains may be realized from cross-disciplinary research, 2) significant benefits may be realized from considering uncertainty, 3) advanced algorithms?probabilistic search methods and efficient methods for Bayesian analysis?and increased computing power should greatly extend the applicability of existing methods, and 4) in particular, decision-theoretic methods that have wide application for sequential decision-making. A new decision-theoretic method, Bayesian programming (BP), was developed that takes advantage of the increased computing power and improvements in Bayesian analysis methods. The method has wide applicability, suitable for problems in which there is 1) uncertainty in the modeling, 2) stochastic behavior in the systems that are modeled, 3) the possibility to reduce uncertainty through data collection, and 4) the opportunity for a recourse decision after a period of data collection. The approach combines systematic search methods (mathematical programming) and Bayesian statistical analysis techniques (Markov chain Monte Carlo) in a decision analysis framework. The BP method is tested with application to a hypothetical, but realistic river basin management problem, using real data from the much-studied Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada. The management problem involves balancing the objectives of pulp mill development and water quality protection (dissolved oxygen).

Examination of the results indicated that the BP method is a practical method worthy of additional research.

Originating in the highlands of central Mexico, through migration, mutation, and sexual recombination, this pathogen has proven mobile and highly variable. Three monogenic R genes (Ph-1, Ph-2, and Ph-3) for resistance to late blight have been identified in tomato. However, P. infestans isolates which overcome each of these individual R genes have been documented. The objectives of this research were to characterize the inheritance of late blight resistance in the home garden tomato 'Richter's Wild Tomato', to determine if this resistance is allelic to any of the three previously identified resistance sources, and to evaluate late blight resistance of R gene F1 hybrid combinations relative to individual R genes. 'Richter's Wild Tomato' was crossed with NC215E-1, a late blight susceptible fresh market breeding line, and evaluation of derived BC1F2, BC2F2, and BC3F1 populations indicated single gene inheritance of late blight resistance. Evaluation of an F2 population derived from the cross 'Richter's Wild Tomato' x 'Legend' (Ph-2) indicated that the monogenic resistance conferred by 'Richter's Wild Tomato' was allelic to Ph-2. Combinations of Ph-2, either from 'Richter's Wild Tomato' or 'Legend', and a fresh market line possessing Ph-3 displayed superior resistance versus individual R genes and other R gene combinations in North Carolina field trials under natural inoculation. Combined resistance has the potential to not only provide a superior level of resistance, but to also be more stable over time.</field><field name="date">2003-06-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06042003-073908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTEGRATED BIOPROCESSING OF NATIVE AND ENGINEERED COMPONENTS FROM TOBACCO (NICOTIANA TABACUM L.)</field><field name="creator">Whitfield, Matthew Bruce</field><field name="description">The bioprocessing of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is attracting attention as a means for the production of transgenic proteins, as well as native proteins and secondary metabolites, and is doing so at a time when recent reductions in demand for the conventionally produced tobacco have created a need for alternative crops. Of the potentially valuable natural products produced by tobacco, many are sequestered on the leaf surface as cuticular wax or trichome exudate. Because of the potential high value of many of these leaf surface components as pharmaceuticals, fragrance elements, and pesticides, as well as the known ease of their removal from the leaf via a simple solvent wash, procedures have been developed to extract these compounds in a manner that could be readily integrated into a tobacco bioprocessing operation. To this end, well-established methods for the analytical extraction of the leaf surface chemistry have been modified to improve their suitability for such integration. A battery of solvents including methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, and acetone were selected for their theorized ability to extract the components of interest as well as the improvements in washed tissue condition and process cost and safety they would likely confer relative to methylene chloride, the analytical solvent of choice. The amounts of some major components (cis-abienol, &#225;- &amp; &#226;-cembratrienediols, docosanol, and sucrose esters) extracted from tissue by sequential, timed washes with each solvent were quantified by gas chromatography and compared to amounts extracted by methylene chloride. Most of the solvents tested extracted high levels of the components analyzed with varying degrees of efficiency. Methanol, ethanol, and n-propanol were found to quickly extract levels of components generally comparable to those extracted by methylene chloride. Regardless of any other considerations, methylene chloride and similar solvents are generally not suitable for extraction of components from the surface of the tobacco leaf prior to extraction of proteins because they cause denaturation and precipitation of proteins subsequently extracted from tissue, as well as tissue wilting due to disruption of cellular membranes. All the solvents studied were found to have less deleterious effects on the integrity of the leaf than methylene chloride. In addition, solvent effects on the extraction and crystallization of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; ?Fraction 1 protein?) from washed tissue were studied. Fortuitously, methanol and ethanol washed tissue were found to result in higher levels of Rubisco crystallization than unwashed tissue. All other solvents, however, including n-propanol, were found to reduce crystallizable Rubisco. Notably, crystallizable Rubisco levels in all cases were increased relative to the amounts of other soluble (?Fraction 2?) proteins. To generally demonstrate the effect of surface washing on transgenic proteins produced in tobacco, tissue from plants modified to produce bovine stomach lysozyme (BSL) were washed with methylene chloride and the alternative solvents. Of the solvents tested, only methanol and isopropanol resulted in significant decreases in lysozyme activity in a total protein extract of washed tissue. Moreover, immunoblotting of extracts from washed tissue indicated that the observed activity reductions may have been caused by inactivation of the enzyme, rather than decrease in extractability. On the bases of surface extraction efficiency, Rubisco crystallization, and lysozyme activity, ethanol would appear to be the best choice for leaf surface extraction in an integrated bioprocess. However, solvent selection would also be dependent upon the relative importance of the products affected; if Rubisco is of much lower value than the other products, then it may be that n-propanol would be a better choice. Furthermore, it is readily apparent that solvent wash effects would need to be studied on a case by case basis for any other native or engineered proteins of interest.</field><field name="date">2004-08-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06042004-020152/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavior and habitat use of introduced flathead catfish in a North Carolina Piedmont river</field><field name="creator">Malindzak, Edward George</field><field name="description">The flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris is a large piscivorous carnivore that has been widely introduced beyond its native range. I studied the behavior of a flathead catfish population that has recently inhabited a section of the Deep River, North Carolina (in the upper Cape Fear River basin), and currently coexists with the federally endangered Cape Fear shiner Notropis mekistocholas. This coexistence raises concerns of predation risks of the flathead catfish on the Cape Fear shiner. I radio-tagged 24 adult flathead catfish in the Deep River between Carbonton and Highfalls dams and monitored their behavior from June 2004 to August 2005. Fish were tracked weekly to determine seasonal patterns, and subsets of those were tracked once per hour for a 24-hour period to determine diel patterns. Eight of the fish were captured, tagged, and released in the upstream, shallow section of the river, and 16 in the deep, downstream, impounded section. A majority of the tagged fish either quickly moved into or stayed in the downstream, impounded section for the entire study period. Flathead catfish selected microhabitats non-randomly annually and within three functional seasons (spawning, growth, and winter). Flathead catfish were usually associated with habitats that were relatively deep (3-6 m), slow in velocity, over bedrock substrates, and nearly always in or adjacent to coarse woody debris or associated with no cover. Among seasons, these fish utilized different habitats, with faster bottom velocities during the spawning season, silt/clay substrates and faster mean column velocities in the growth season, and in the winter season, they occupied the deepest water available and most frequently, not associated with any cover type. I calculated estimates of seasonal home range as linear home range and kernel density estimates (99%, 95%, 90% and 50%). Flathead catfish mean linear home ranges were greater than 16 km annually, and mean seasonal ranges were 13.1 km during spawning, 10.1 km during growth, and 3.8 km in winter. Mean kernel density estimates of home range at 95% level were approximately half the linear estimate of home range annually and for each season. Mean kernel density estimates of home range at 50% (or core use) level were one-tenth of respective linear home ranges. On a diel scale, flathead catfish were generally more active and occupied deeper water at night. My findings on habitat use of adult flathead catfish at multiple spatial and temporal scales suggest the predation risk to Cape Fear shiners may be minimal, based on limited overlap. Furthermore, my results support other recent research describing flathead catfish as a highly mobile fish. These results add to our ecological understanding of this species in its introduced range and offer implications for improved management.</field><field name="date">2006-06-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06042006-143746/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RNA Dynamics and Interactions Investigated by Photocrosslinking</field><field name="creator">Huggins, Bruce Wayne</field><field name="description">A complete understanding of protein synthesis requires description of the cyclical motions and interactions that occur in ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA during translation. The purpose of the following research was to gain understanding of the nature of these motions and interactions, and to develop new tools to measure how ligands alter the conformational flexibility of RNA during the steps of initiation, elongation and termination. Different tRNA substrates were bound to the E. coli 70S to simulate the arrangement of the tRNA-ribosomal complex before and after peptide bond formation, and different UV-induced 16S rRNA-tRNA photocrosslinks were produced in these complexes, illustrating that the 16S rRNA P-site undergoes local deformations during elongation. A statistical study was undertaken to understand the nature of conformational states in the 30S ribosomal subunit. Using the lists of observed UVB/C- and UVA-s4U-induced crosslinks and the T. thermophilus 30S X-ray crystal structure, frequencies were compared to a number of geometrical parameters demonstrating that crosslink formation requires substantial RNA motions. In addition, the results show that the restricted pattern of crosslink formation in E. coli 16S rRNA is due to the overall rigidity of the 30S subunit outside of the active site. One consequence of these conclusions is that potocrosslinking rates depend on the ease of inter-nucleotide conformational movements. This was exploited in a study that used the temperature response of the rate constant for the UVA-induced photo-crosslink between s4U8 X C13 in E. coli tRNA to determine tRNA geometry and internal energy. The rate constants followed Arrhenius behavior in their dependence on temperature, and this allowed calculation of the activation energy associated with the conformational rearrangement necessary to bring the photoreactive bonds together. The experiments show that changes in the tRNA on ribosomes can be uncovered by photocrosslinking, that RNA mobility occurs by transient conformational changes, and describe a new technique than can quantitatively measure the internal energy associated with these conformational movements.</field><field name="date">2006-06-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06042006-151722/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE LESSONS OF HUNGER: FOOD, DRINK, AND THE CONCEPT OF CORRECTIVE AFFLICTION IN THREE PURITAN CAPTIVITY NARRATIVES</field><field name="creator">Phillips, James Henry IV</field><field name="description">While scholars have noted the relationship of food and drink imagery in the Puritan captivity narrative genre to corrective affliction, the focus of this study is to provide an extended evaluation of this relationship.

Stream temperature is a fundamental limiting factor in the distribution and production of brook trout and their range is bounded to the south by a mean July air temperature of 21&#194;&#186;C. Average air temperature in the U.S. has risen by 0.6&#194;&#186;C over the last century and may increase by another 6&#194;&#186;C over the next 100 years. Climate warming may threaten the long-term survival of the brook trout populations in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Using projected future climate scenarios and land use/land cover classes, we developed ordinal and binary logistic regression models to characterize current habitat suitability of brook trout, determine future suitable habitat and prioritize subwatersheds for brook trout conservation. Explanatory variables held in common in every model were the baseline variables (either forest or agriculture), the respective baseline variable with temperature as an interaction term and wetlands. This analysis further supports temperature as a major driver in the distribution of brook trout. Projected future suitable habitat was shown to be moving further north over time. This analysis resulted in map outputs illustrating areas of greatest brook trout population subwatershed status changes and indicates potential areas of concern for brook trout survival due to projected future climate scenarios. These results can aid in prioritizing subwatersheds for brook trout conservation and restoration.</field><field name="date">2009-08-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06042009-152530/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Establishment of an Electronic Journal in Textiles &amp; Apparel</field><field name="creator">Jagannathan, Balachandar</field><field name="description">This study identifies how an electronic journal can be established and implemented in the textile and apparel field.

Chatter increases tool and machine wear rates, reduces tolerances, degrades surface finish, and can result in tool breakage. For these reasons, its avoidance is critical. Researchers at N.C. State University are focusing on the development of technologies to detect and avoid this dynamic instability. The primary objective of this project is to develop accurate, high bandwidth, low cost capacitive displacement sensors for use with a prototype electromechanically actuated chatter prediction device. These application-specific sensors are required to have at least 1.0 &#61549;m resolution, 1.0 kHz bandwidth, and linearity over the desired measurement ranges. These sensors must output analog DC voltages proportional to the vertical and horizontal displacements of a specifically engineered machine tool. A simulation-based design process is utilized to optimize the mechanical and electrical aspects of these capacitive probes, the electrical circuits, and the mechanical mounting hardware. Performance and stability are simulated using MATLAB&#174; and SPICE&#174; modeling software and are validated experimentally using static and dynamic test rigs.</field><field name="date">2003-06-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06052003-162301/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of Models of Bacterial Infection in the Intestinal Tract</field><field name="creator">Smith, Althea</field><field name="description">The small intestine is prone to infections by bacteria that can adhere to the surface wall. We wish to better understand an infection of the small intestine caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and to achieve this objective we present three models: a chemostat and two mechanistic spatial models in 1-D and 2-D. The chemostat model is a dynamic model where four biologically significant steady states of the infection were observed: washout, persistence, threshold, and blowup. These results concur with previous work done in this field; however in this instance our model is far less complex. The 2-D mechanistic spatial model suggests that bacteria that adhere to the intestinal wall cause the infection to persist. The 2-D model also suggests that the radial gradients of EPEC are less important than the longitudinal gradients, allowing us to proceed with a 1-D analysis. The 1-D model permits an in-depth realization of the infection process, including bacterial growth and microvilli growth kinetics. This paper will discuss how our 3 models merge EPEC pathogenesis mechanisms with current-day CSTR and PFR colonization models.</field><field name="date">2007-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06062007-130811/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Analysis of Lock-free Data Structures</field><field name="creator">Sarkar, Abhik</field><field name="description">The advent of multi-processor systems has motivated programmers to develop multi-threaded and multi-process applications on shared memory data structures. In these applications, multiple processes read and update shared data structure concurrently, which may lead to race conditions resulting in incoherent memory. To ensure exclusivity of access to this shared memory, programmers have been using locks. Lock-based concurrency is a pessimistic approach that assumes conflicts among concurrent processes to occur frequently.However, if few conflicts occur, lock-based concurrency unnecessarily reduce concurrency. One solution to improve concurrency, is to allow non-conflicting processes to execute in parallel. This can be gained by using fine locks, but programming with them is complex and error-prone. Consequently, researchers have devised an optimistic concurrency mechanism known as lock-free algorithms. Various lock-free libraries have been developed that are either data structure specific or universal constructs. However, these lock-free libraries have been restricted to simple data structures that do not meet the requirements of a real-world application. This work focuses on implementing a lock-free data structure suitable for a real-world application. The suitability of various implementations is analyzed. Design choices are made based upon the requirements and the suitability of lock-free implementations to the specific application considered. Finally, the performance of the lock-free implementation versus lock-based implementation are compared. Along with it, certain insights related to reduced complexity of the implementation and atomicity of lock-free implementation that make it robust are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007-07-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06062007-161523/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterization of the protein disulfide isomerase multigene family in plants.</field><field name="creator">Houston, Norma L</field><field name="description">Protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) contain thioredoxin domains and aid in the formation of proper disulfide bonds during protein folding. Iterative BLAST searches of sequence databases were used to identify 22 PDI-like (PDIL) genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize (Zea mays) and 19 in rice (Oryza sativa). The PDIL genes were resolved into 10 phylogenetic groups. Genes in groups I-V had two active thioredoxin domains while members of groups VI-X had one active thioredoxin domain. One single domain PDIL, maize PDIL5-1, showed increased accumulation in the endosperm mutants that produced defective storage proteins, but PDIL5-1 was not localized to endomembrane fractions. Expression analysis was done in eighteen PDIL genes in maize endosperm, a storage tissue, and two vegetative organs, embryo and leaves. Eight PDIL genes were expressed mainly in endosperm, and two of these genes (PDIL1-2 and 2-3) had increased expression levels only in the endosperm that produced defective storage proteins. There were three PDIL genes (1-3, 1-4, 1-5) that showed the highest expression levels in the embryo, while two other genes, adenosine 5?-phosphosulfate reductase-like (APRL) 2 and APRL8, had elevated expression levels in leaves. To further characterize members of the gene family, isomerase and reductase assays were conducted to test for recombinant maize PDIL1-1, 1-3, 2-3 and 5-1 enzymatic activity in vitro. Recombinant and endogenous maize PDIL1-1 showed both isomerase and reductase activity while recombinant PDIL1-3 showed anti-chaperone activity.

When this precaution is observable to criminals, as in the case of a home burglar alarm system advertised with a sign or sticker, it has the beneficial effect of decreasing the probability of burglary of alarmed homeowners. However, because a burglar is rational in his criminal activity, he will avoid protected homes and target homeowners without alarms, increasing their probability of burglary. Observable private precaution therefore incorporates both the deterrence (Clotfelter 1978) and diversion (Shavell 1991) effects. Even though burglar alarms have been identified as effective deterrents, little research has been devoted to determining if they also divert crime. In this dissertation, I examine the diversion effect associated with burglar alarms. In chapter three, I estimate the net effect, or combined deterrence and diversion effects, of burglar alarms on burglary rates and find that burglary rates fall only slightly with increases in burglar alarm use. Assuming that burglar alarms deter, this finding suggests the presence of the diversion effect muting deterrence. In chapters four and five, I present two methods for measuring the diversion effect associated with burglar alarms using data from the homeowner&#226;s insurance industry. Since companies with more non-alarmed customers face larger costs due to diversion, chapter four measures the diversion effect as the relationship between the market shares of homeowner&#226;s insurance companies and the protective device discounts they offer. Chapter five&#226;s approach is based on the empirical method of Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) and uses supply and demand parameters in an oligopolistic framework to measure the diversion effect as the difference in the probabilities of burglary of non-alarmed homeowners when some homes install alarms and when no homes are alarmed. Both methods show that diversion can be measured. When empirically tested, they also yield estimates of the diversion effect. Although the social effects associated with burglar alarms are likely to be positive on balance, I expose the hidden costs that may be associated with observable precautionary measures.</field><field name="date">2008-07-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06062008-172606/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Machining of Bulk Metallic Glass</field><field name="creator">Bakkal, Mustafa</field><field name="description">The turning and drilling of Zr52.5Ti5Cu17.9Ni14.6Al10 metallic glass (BMG) are evaluated in this study. The mechanics of machining and chip formation and characterization are investigated. In the lathe turning of BMG, above a threshold cutting speed, the low thermal conductivity of BMG leads to chip temperatures high enough to cause the chip oxidation and associated light emission. The high temperature produced by this exothermic chemical reaction causes crystallization within the chips. Oxide layer, amorphous region, fully crystalline region, and crystalline-amorphous transition region are observed in the cross-section of the chips. The x-ray diffraction peaks match the pattern for monoclinic ZrO2. Turning chips morphology suggests that increasing amounts of viscous flow control the chip-removal process. Moreover, viscous flow and crystallization can occur during the machining of the bulk metallic glass, even under the high temperature gradient and strain rate. For the BMG chip without light emission, the serrated chip with adiabatic shear band and void formation was observed. High cutting speed significantly reduced the forces for BMG machining due to thermal softening. Roughness of machined BMG surfaces is generally better than that of Al6061-T6 and SS304. Tool wear is a problem for BMG turning. Chipping and thermal softening on the lathe tool cutting edges can be observed. Drilling of BMG shows that holes with precision geometry and good surface roughness can be efficiently produced in BMG using the high speed steel and WC-Co drills at spindle speed that does not exceed the limit for chip light emission. Morphology of BMG drilling chip are classified and analyzed. The thermal conductivity of tool material and cutting speed are concluded as two critical factors that triggered the chip exothermic oxidation and light emission. The chip light emission has profound impact on the drill wear, as shown by the experimentally measured thrust force and torque. This study concludes the precision machining of BMG is possible with the selection of feasible tools and process parameters.</field><field name="date">2004-06-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06072004-004846/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entropy Based Moment Selection in Generalized Method of Moments</field><field name="creator">Shin, Changmock</field><field name="description">GMM provides a computationally convenient estimation method and the resulting estimator can be shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal under the fairly moderate regularity conditions. It is widely known that the information content in the population moment condition has impacts on the quality of the asymptotic approximation to finite sample behavior. This dissertation focuses on a moment selection procedure that leads us to choose relevant (asymptotically efficient and non-redundant) moment conditions in the presence of weak identification. The contributions of this dissertation can be characterized as follows: in the framework of linear model, (i) the concept of nearly redundant moment conditions is introduced and the connection between near redundancy and weak identification is explored; (ii) performance of RMSC(c) is evaluated when weak identification is a possibility but the parameter vector to be estimated is not weakly identified by the candidate set of moment conditions; (iii) performance of RMSC(c) is also evaluated when the parameter vector is weakly identified by the candidate set; (iv) a combined strategy of Stock and Yogo's (2002) test for weak identification and RMSC(c) is introduced and evaluated; (v) (i) and (ii) are extended to allow for nonlinear dynamic models. The subsequent simulation results support the analytical findings: when only a part of instruments in the set of possible candidates for instruments are relevant and the others are redundant given all or some of the relevant ones, RMSC(c) chooses all the relevant instruments with high probabilities and improves the quality of the post-selection inferences; when the candidates are in order of their importance, a combined strategy of Stock and Yogo's (2002) pretest and RMSC(c) improves the post-selection inferences, however it tends to select parsimonious models; when all the possible candidates are equally important, it seems that RMSC(c) does not provide any merits. However, in the last case, asymptotic efficiency and non-redundancy can be achieved by basing the estimation and inference on all the possible candidates.</field><field name="date">2005-06-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06072005-112026/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching for Better Logic Circuits: Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Automate Digital Design.</field><field name="creator">Lammert, Adam Crawford</field><field name="description">LAMMERT, ADAM CRAWFORD. Searching for Better Logic Circuits: Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Automate Digital Design. (Under the direction of Dr. Edward Willmore Davis Jr.) Logic circuits are at the core of modern computing. The process of designing circuits which are efficient is thus of critical importance. Usually, logic circuits are designed by human beings who have a specific repertoire of conventional design techniques. These techniques limit the solutions that may be considered during the design process in both form and quality. The limits guide designers through the immense realm of possible circuits, thus making the problem more manageable. Simultaneously, the limits sometimes eliminate from consideration circuits which are optimal in terms of size, depth, etc. By exploring the full range of possible solutions, circuits could be discovered which are superior to the best known human designs. Automated design techniques borrowed from artificial intelligence have allowed exactly that. Specifically, the application of genetic algorithms has allowed the creation of circuits which are substantially superior to the best known human designs. This paper expands on such previous research with a three-fold approach. This approach is comprised of (1) two distinct optimizations for the application of genetic algorithms to design, (2) the formulation and implementation of a systematic search technique to the problem and (3) a comparison of the relative merits of the optimized genetic algorithm and the systematic search technique. It is contended that both genetic algorithms and systematic search can be preferable depending on the situation at hand.</field><field name="date">2006-06-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06072006-140938/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication and characterization of novel single and bicomponent electrospun nanofibrous mats</field><field name="creator">Ojha, Satyajeet Sooryakant</field><field name="description">Nanofibers were produced using relatively new electrospinning technique. Single layer nanofibers were fabricated using nylon-6. Several parameters such as polymer molecular weight, concentration, surface tension, applied electric voltage, distance between tip to grounded electrode and feed rate were investigated to optimize fiber consistency and diameter. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to study fiber morphology and diameter. Understanding the effects of various parameters mentioned above, electrospinning strategy was further utilized to produce nanofibers with novel core-sheath structure using chitosan, a biopolymer and polyethylene oxide (PEO). Chitosan is very difficult to electrospin, to alleviate this problem PEO was used as sheath to support chitosan core. For this purpose, rheology of polymer solutions was evaluated for successful fabrication of core-sheath nanofibers. Only 3 wt % chitosan was found to produce coaxial structure with 4 wt % PEO, due to their proximity in rheological behavior. Coaxial morphology of nanofibers was verified by transmission electron microscopy having 250 nm and 100 nm as sheath and core diameters respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to investigate the effect of de-ionized water treatment of core-sheath mats where in PEO layer was removed off in order to get pure chitosan nanofibers. Coaxial nanofibers with one component were also fabricated using pure PEO as core and PEO doped with Multi-walled carbon nanotubes as sheath material. Results showed that as carbon nanotubes were subjected to relatively smaller volumes, predominantly on the surface culminated in appreciable increase in conductivity as well as mechanical properties. Coaxial nanofibers produced from electrospinning are of particular interest in tissue engineering and wound healing scaffolds.</field><field name="date">2007-08-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06082007-125208/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Past Experience and Multiple-use Trail Conflict</field><field name="creator">Bradsher, Debra J</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to test the relationship between past experience in several trail activities and conflict due to encounters with trail users engaged in those activities. This research question involved the following trail activity groups: runners, walkers or hikers, mountain bikers, horseback riders, and users with dogs. Data were collected through on-site interviews with 421 trail users in the Greater Snow King Area of the Bridger-Teton National Forest near Jackson, Wyoming from July 17 to August 11, 2002. Conflict was assessed by asking participants to rate their increased/decreased enjoyment due to encounters with each of the other user groups. Past experience in an activity was determined by whether a participant had ever participated in that activity on any trail. In tests of the relationship between past experience in an activity and conflict due to encounters with participants of that activity, results indicated that two were statistically significant at the .05 level (running and walking dogs). Trail users who had participated in the activity in the past experienced less conflict when encountering that group than did respondents who had never done the activity before. Likewise, those who had participated in an activity in the past were more likely to experience increased enjoyment due to encounters with that group than were trail users who had never done the activity before. This pattern held for running, mountain biking, horseback riding, and dog walking although it was not significant at the .05 level in the cases of mountain biking and horseback riding. The relationship between past experience walking or hiking and conflict due to walkers or hikers could not be tested because only two respondents indicated that they had never walked or hiked on a trail. Trail users with past experience in an activity may have experienced less conflict when encountering that group because they better understood the requirements of the activity or because they saw the other users as having lifestyles, values, and/or attitudes similar to their own. Findings suggest that efforts to promote tolerance for other user groups may reduce the occurrence of conflict among trail users. Other implications for management and further research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2003-06-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06092003-134354/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Multiple Inhibin Model of the Human Menstrual Cycle</field><field name="creator">Pasteur, Roger Drew II</field><field name="description">Inhibin is one of several hormones which collectively regulate the human female reproductive endocrine system. In recent years, physiologists have been able to separately assay two forms of inhibin. We begin by discussing the physiology and endocrinology that underlie the menstrual cycle. Then, we fit an existing delay differential equation model of the human menstrual cycle to new data describing average hormone levels of young women throughout the menstrual cycle. Next, we consider the existence and stability of equilibrium and periodic solutions, analyze bifurcations, and perform a sensitivity analysis. We compare and contrast these results to previously published results based on the same model but a different data set. Because the introduction of exogenous hormones, whether pharmacological or environmental, can have significant effects on the menstrual cycle, we model the effects of these external hormones. Next, we introduce an expanded model that more fully accounts for the actions of both forms of inhibin. We optimize the parameters to fit the data, then discuss the equilibrium and periodic solutions, bifurcations, and sensitivity for this new model and parameter set. Next, we use the model to consider the effects of exogenous pharmacological hormones. Finally, we discuss the effects on the menstrual cycle of age-related hormone production changes that occur during the peri-menopausal years. This leads to a second parameter set, with only a few variations from the first one, for which the model approximates the monthly hormonal fluctuations for a woman around age 40. In closing, we discuss future possibilities for this line of research.</field><field name="date">2008-06-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06102008-194807/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the Between- and Within-Person Relationships between Pain and Cognitive Performance in Older Adults</field><field name="creator">Weatherbee, Sarah Rose</field><field name="description">The current study was part of a larger study where overarching purpose was to design a daily measure of everyday cognitive performance. The current investigation examined the extent to which self-report pain was related to cognitive performance in a sample of 148 community dwelling older adults (M = 73 years old, SD = 6.84). A multidimensional battery was used to assess socio-demographics, physical health (e.g. self-report pain, self-report physical health), mental health (e.g. negative affect, life-event stress, and daily stress), and cognitive functioning (e.g. short-term memory, processing speed, inductive reasoning, and working memory) at pretest and over 8 occasions. The direct relationship between self-report pain and cognition was examined as well as potential moderators and mediators of the pain-cognition relationship both at the between- and within-person levels. At the between-person level, self-reported pain was found to be significantly related to processing speed, where high pain was associated with slower reaction time. At the within-person level self-reported pain was found to be significantly related to working memory, where on days when self-reported pain was higher than an individual&#226;s average, their working memory performance suffered. Within-person self-reported pain X age interactions were found for short-term memory, processing speed, and working memory. Additionally, negative affect and stress were found to moderate the pain-cognition relationship. The strength of the pain-cognition relationship is best understood by examining moderating factors such as age, stress, and negative affect. Furthermore, the handful of significant interactions at the within-person level suggest that the pain-cognition relationship is dynamic and should not be assessed at only one time point.</field><field name="date">2009-08-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06112009-102825/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Vitro Cardiotoxicity of Residual Oil Fly Ash.</field><field name="creator">knuckles, Travis</field><field name="description">Knuckles, Travis Lee. In Vitro Cardiotoxicity of Residual Oil Fly Ash. (Under the direction of Kenneth B. Adler and Kevin L. Dreher). Epidemiological studies have shown an association between air pollution particulate matter (PM) and adverse cardiovascular effects. Although numerous mechanisms have been proposed, the actual mechanism(s) as well as emission sources and associated causal properties by which PM affects the cardiovascular system remain elusive. At least some adverse PM health effects can be attributed to bioavailable constituents, most notably, the transition metal content of the particles. Toxicological studies in rats using residual oil fly ash (ROFA) combustion source particles show extrapulmonary effects ranging from thermo-regulatory alterations, myocardial necrotic lesions, to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Exposure of rats to ROFA via intratracheal instillation shows a rapid and transient increase in plasma metal content as early as 15mins post-exposure, suggesting that PM constituents are bioavailable to both the systemic circulation and perfused organs. However, the impact of this systemic exposure on extrapulmonary organs at the cellular and molecular levels is unknown. In this study, cardiomyocytes derived from 1-day-old rat pups were exposed to determine the direct effects of a particle free residual oil fly ash leachate (ROFA-L). Using concentration of leachate relevant to amount that were found in the plasma of rats following pulmonary deposition, I have shown that ROFA bioavailable constituents cytotoxicity in cardiomyocyte cultures and alter cardiomyocyte gene expression and transcription factor activation profiles consistent with alteration in cardiomyocyte growth and function.</field><field name="date">2005-07-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122005-112617/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical inference for correlated data based on censored observations</field><field name="creator">PARK, JUNG WOOK</field><field name="description">Many physical quantities measured over time and space are often observed with data irregularities, such as truncation (detection limit) or censoring. Practitioners often disregard censored data cases which may result in inefficient estimates. On the other hand, censored data treated as observed values will lead to biased estimates. For instance, the data values collected by a monitoring device may have a specific detection limit and the device records the value with its limit, or a constant exceeding the limit value, when the real value exceeds the limit. We present an attractive remedy for handling censored or truncated data collected over time or space. Our method produces (asymptotically) unbiased estimates that are more efficient than the estimates based on treating censored observations as completely observed. In particular, we introduce an imputation method particularly well suited for fitting statistical models dealing with correlated observations in the presence of censored data. Our proposed imputation method involves generating random samples from the conditional distribution of the censored data given the (completely) observed data and current estimates of the parameters. The parameter estimates are then updated based on imputed and completely observed data until convergence. Under Gaussian processes, such a conditional distribution turns out to be a truncated multivariate normal distribution. We use a Gibbs sampling method to generate samples from such truncated multivariate normal distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique for a problem common to many correlated data sets and describe its application to several other frequently encountered situations. First, we discuss the use of an imputation technique for a stationary time series data assuming an autoregressive moving average model. Then, we relax the model assumption and discuss how the imputation method works with a nonparametric estimation of a covariance matrix. The use of the imputation method is not limited to a time series model and can be applied to other types of correlated data such as a spatial data. A lattice model is discussed as another application field of the imputation method. For pedagogic purposes, our illustration of the approach based on a simulation study is limited to some simple models such as a first order autoregressive time series model, first order moving average time series model, and first order simultaneous autoregressive error model, with left or right censoring. However, the method can easily be extended to more complicated models. We also derive the Fisher information matrix for an AR(1) process containing censored observations and explain the effect of the censoring on the efficiency gain of the estimates using the trace of the Fisher Information matrix.</field><field name="date">2005-06-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122005-190229/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless Communications with MIMO Systems: Analysis and Practice</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Quan</field><field name="description">Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems using multiple transmit and receive antennas are widely considered as the vital breakthrough that will allow future wireless systems to achieve higher date rates and link reliability with limited bandwidth and power resources. In this dissertation, we address four interesting topics in the wireless MIMO systems, in both point-to-point and multiuser environments. First, in a point-to-point MIMO spatial diversity system, usually the probability distribution function (PDF) of the received SNR is rather involved, which leads to the difficulty in analyzing the average symbol error rate (SER). We provide a succinct result at the high SNR region. Second, in point-to-point wireless MIMO communications, in order to protect the transmitted data against random channel impairment, we consider the problem of link adaptation, including rate adaptation and power control to improve the system performance and guarantee certain quality of service. Third, in a multiuser MIMO wireless network, there is another form of diversity called multiuser diversity which can be exploited to increase the system throughput. By analyzing the scheduling gain (defined as the rate difference between the opportunistic scheduling and round-robin scheduling scheme), we provide a complete analysis on the interaction between the spatial diversity and multiuser diversity. Fourth, in a multiuser MIMO wireless network, we propose a crosslayer-based scheduling scheme that exploits Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding (THP) at the physical (PHY) layer to reduce the multiuser scheduling burden at the medium access control (MAC) layer. Compared with some existing scheduling schemes, the proposed scheme greatly reduces the scheduling complexity while simultaneously improves overall system performance.</field><field name="date">2006-07-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122006-113941/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When Rank Trumps Precision: Using the Power Method to Compute Google?s PageRank</field><field name="creator">Wills, Rebecca Smith</field><field name="description">The PageRank algorithm, developed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, assigns ranking scores to webpages that reflect their relative importance. These scores are based primarily on the link structure of the Web graph and correspond to elements of a dominant left eigenvector, called the PageRank vector, of the stochastic Google matrix. When the starting vector is a probability vector, the iterates of the power method applied to the Google matrix converge to the PageRank vector. Determining when to stop the iterations requires deciding when an iterate vector is good enough. Existing termination criteria rely on various measures of distance between successive iterate vectors. In this dissertation, we investigate how well a power method iterate vector approximates the PageRank vector, we show that the existing termination criteria do not guarantee accurate ranking, and we provide a computationally efficient criterion for determining relative rankings, exact rankings, and ranking intervals of PageRank scores.</field><field name="date">2007-07-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122007-173712/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining Pesticide Dislodgeable Foliar Residues and Their Persistence Following Application to Tall Fescue lawn Turf</field><field name="creator">John, Christopher Vaughn Mr.</field><field name="description">Dislodgeable foliar residues (DFR) can be a primary route for human exposure following pesticide application to turfgrass areas. Consequently, a significant portion of applied pesticide may be available for human exposure via dislodgeable residues. In this study, DFR were determined over a 15-day-period following application of the broadleaf weed herbicide carfentrazone (Ethyl alpha, 2-Dichloro-3-{2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-{4-(difluoromethyl)-4, 5-dihydro-3-methyl-5-oxo-1H-1, 2, 4-triazol-1-yl}-4-fluorobenzenepropanoate ), the pre-emergent herbicide prodiamine (5-dipropylamino-&#945;,&#945;,&#945;-trifluoro-4,6-dinitro-o-toluidine or 2,6-dinitro-N1,N1-dipropyl-4-trifluoromethyl-m-phenylenediamine ) and the insecticide bifenthrin (2-methylbiphenyl-3-ylmethyl (1RS,3RS)-3-[(Z)-2-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoroprop-1-enyl]-2,2-di-methylcyclopropanecarboxylate) to a mature stand of ?Confederate? Tall Fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb). Dislodgeable foliar residues were determined by wiping treated turfgrass with a distilled-water-dampened cheesecloth and analyzing samples using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Less than 20% of the total applied carfentrazone was dislodged with 14% of DFR occurring immediately after application and a total of 6% for the remainder of the 15-day study. Prodiamine DFR averaged 80% over the 11-day study with dislodgeable residue levels ranging from a maximum of 17% of the total applied chemical 8 hours after treatment to a low of 4% 11 days after treatment. Approximately 35% of the total applied bifenthrin was available to be dislodged over 15-day study with 34% DFR loss occurring immediately after application and a total of 1% for the remainder of the sampling periods. If pesticides are allowed to dry on the leaf surface, shortly after application carfentrazone, prodiamine and bifenthrin pose minimal risk to human health via dermal exposure when applied at the labeled rate.</field><field name="date">2007-06-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122007-175300/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods Evaluation and Application in Complex Human Genetic Disease</field><field name="creator">Lou, Xuemei</field><field name="description">One of the most important tasks in human genetics is to search for disease susceptibility genes. Linkage and association analyses are two major approaches for disease-gene mapping. Chapter 1 reviewed the development of disease-gene mapping methods in the past decades. Gene mapping of complex human diseases often results in the identification of multiple potential risk variants within a gene and/or in the identification of multiple genes within a linkage peak. Thus a question of interest is to test whether the linkage result can be explained in part or in full by the candidate SNP if it shows evidence of association, and then provide some guidance for the next time-consuming step of positional cloning of susceptibility genes. Two methods, GIST and LAMP, which access whether the SNP can partially or fully account for the linkage signal in the region identified by a linkage scan, are evaluated on Genetic Analysis Workshop 15 (GAW15) simulated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data and discussed in Chapter 2. The simulation results showed that GIST is simple and works slightly better than LAMP-LE test when there is little linkage evidence, LAMP linkage test has limited power when there is not much linkage evidence, and LAMP association test is the best not only when the linkage evidence is extremely high, but also when there is some LD between the candidate SNP and the trait locus. The fact that complex traits are often determined by multiple genetic and environmental factors with small-to-moderate effects makes it important to investigate the behavior of current association methods under multiple risk variants model. In Chapter 3, we compared APL, FBAT, LAMP, APL-Haplotype, FBAT-LC and APL-OSA conditional test in five multiple risk variants models. The simulation results showed that the power of single marker association tests is closely correlated with the amount of LD between marker and disease loci, and these tests maintain good power to detect multiple risk variants in a small region with moderate degree of LD for fully genotyped families. Global tests, such as FBAT-LC are sensitive to the presence of at least one susceptibility variant, but are not helpful for selecting the most promising SNPs for further study. We reported that if multiple haplotypes are associated with different disease loci, the haplotype tests results can be misleading while APL-OSA conditional test has the greatest power to properly dissect the clustered associated markers for all models with an acceptable type I error rate ranging from 0.033 to 0.056. We applied APL-OSA conditional test on GENECARD samples, and got reasonable results. One linkage region of particular interest on chromosome 3 was identified by two independent genome linkage scan with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Multiple disease susceptibility genes have been reported from this region, and there are also linkage evidence that this region may harbors a gene or genes determining HDL-C levels. Within this region, a search for HDL-C QTL and analyses of the relationship between genetic variants, HDL-C level to CAD risk are discussed in Chapter 4. We performed CAD association and HDL-C QTL analysis on two independent datasets. We identified SNP rs2979307 in the OSBPL11 gene which survives a Bonferroni correction. We observed different HDL-C trends with HDL-C associated SNPs. Even with the evident heterogeneity presented in our CAD population, we detected several association signals with SNPs in KALRN, MYLK, CDGAP and PAK2 genes in both CAD datasets for HDL-C, where all these genes belong to a Rho pathway.</field><field name="date">2008-08-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122008-114358/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemistry to Music: Discovering How Music-Based Teaching Affects Academic Achievement and Student Motivation in an 8th Grade Science Class</field><field name="creator">McCammon, William Lodge</field><field name="description">Teachers should have access to new and innovative tools in order to engage and motivate their students in the classroom. This is especially important as many students view school as an antiquated and dull environment &#226; which they must seemingly suffer through to advance. School need not be a dreaded environment. The use of music as a tool for learning can be employed by any teacher to create an engaging and exciting atmosphere where students actively participate and learn to value their classroom experience. Through this study, a product and process was developed that is now available for any 8th grade science teacher interested in using music to enhance their content. In this study 8th grade students (n=41) in a public school classroom actively interacted with modern songs created to enhance the teaching of chemistry. Data were collected and analyzed in order to determine the effects that the music treatment had on student achievement and motivation, compared to a control group (n=35). Current literature provides a foundation for the benefits for music listening and training, but academic research in the area of using music as a tool for teaching content was noticeably absent. This study identifies a new area of research called &#226;Music-based Teaching&#226; which results in increases in motivation for 8th grade students learning chemistry. The unintended results of the study are additionally significant as the teacher conducting the treatment experienced newfound enthusiasm, passion, and excitement for her profession.</field><field name="date">2008-08-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum and Instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06122008-160544/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterizing the Spatial Variation in Particle Aggregation due to Heterogeneous Turbulence in a Flocculation Reactor</field><field name="creator">Hopkins, Daniel Cory</field><field name="description">A study was performed to investigate the impact of turbulent heterogeneity on aggregation and breakup in a flocculation reactor.

Results indicated that floc growth increased while the floc size and variance in the floc size distribution decreased as G increased.

The entrance of lasers in the industry has brought about a better method for producing these holes. However the ultra-short pulse lasers that are normally used are extremely expensive and require many pulses to remove the material due to the small amount of energy they deposit. The objective of this research is to examine the feasibility of laser ablation using a 300W, CW Single Mode fiber laser which has high continuous power output for each pulse and has excellent beam quality. The results show that laser ablation occurs when a 100mm lens is used with pulse durations at 40 microseconds or below. Using one 18 microsecond pulse, a blind hole of 43.6 microns in diameter and 23.6 microns in depth with an aspect ratio of 0.54 can be created with little heat affected zone. This performance is comparable to nanosecond lasers, but with much higher hole depth per pulse. It was also found that the pulse duration must be short enough so that the ablating effect of the initial spike of an enhanced pulse is not nullified due to melting. At longer pulse durations (50 microseconds or more), raised surfaces are created instead of holes.</field><field name="date">2005-06-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06132005-191622/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Early Post-Hatch Dietary Amino Acid Levels on Satellite Cell Dynamics in Turkeys.</field><field name="creator">Nierobisz, Lidia Sylwia</field><field name="description">Satellite cells are defined as myonuclear myogenic stem cells residing between sarcolemma and basal lamina of the myofiber. Myofiber number is established during embryonic development. Post-hatch and post-natal muscle growth occurs exclusively through an increase in myofiber size. The increase of myofiber size in early post-hatch turkeys is predominantly dependent on the contribution of new myonuclei to pre-existing myofibers by the mitotically active satellite cell population. Preliminary data in broilers has revealed that supplementation with amino acid deficient diet immediately post-hatch results in an increase satellite cell mitotic activity in Pectoralis thoracicus muscle in 3-day-old chicks as compared to birds fed adequate and above requirement amino acid levels. Additionally, chicks denied feed for first three days post-hatch exhibited significantly lower satellite cell mitotic activity in Pectoralis thoracicus muscle as compared to remaining treatment groups. The hypothesis tested in the current study was that turkeys supplemented with crude protein and amino acid deficient diet early post-hatch would produce higher meat yield at 140 days. Since very little is known about the impact of early nutrition on the satellite cell activity in commercially raised turkeys, the objective of the present study was to measure the effect of different levels of dietary crude protein and amino acids (0.88 NRC, 1.00 NRC, and 1.12 NRC) as well as feed deprivation on the satellite cell mitotic activity, Pectoralis thoracicus muscle weight, and body weight of commercially raised turkey males. At 3, 4, 5, 8, and 11 days of age, birds from each treatment group were injected with 5-bromo-2?-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to label mitotically active cells. The right Pectoralis thoracicus muscle was harvested one hour after BrdU injection followed by BrdU and PI immunohistochemistry and measurement of myofiber diameters. On the third day post-hatch satellite cell mitotic activity was the highest (P&lt;0.05) in 0.88 NRC treatment group and the lowest (P&lt;0.05) in the feed deprived group. On the fourth day post-hatch, feed deprived birds exhibited the lowest (P&lt;0.05) satellite cell mitotic activity and muscle weight. At market age (140 days), there were no significant differences (P&gt;0.05) between treatments in body weight and Pectoralis thoracicus muscle weight. Further evaluation of mechanistic pathways governing satellite cell mitotic activity and muscle growth are necessary to devise early post-hatch feeding strategies that would lead to improvement in Pectoralis thoracicus muscle yield in male turkeys.</field><field name="date">2007-07-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06132007-140151/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compatible Taper and Volume Models for Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides L.) in Eastern North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Cuneo, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Efforts to restore Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides L.) over parts of its historical range have led to an increased interest in the species for commercial logging. With this interest comes the need to develop equations to estimate the taper and volume of Atlantic White Cedar (AWC) stems. A total of 210 trees were selected from three different regions of eastern North Carolina (Outer Coastal Plain, Carolina Bays, and Sandhills) for the development of taper and volume models. Diameters at approximately 5 foot height intervals were measured from each selected tree. Several previously developed taper model forms were examined for their fit to this data using mixed models. Of these examined models the Demaerschalk (1972) model had the best fit, though a common trend was noted in the residuals of several of the candidate models. A new taper model composed of a linear function (L), an exponential decay curve (E), and a sine function (S), termed L.E.S., was derived in order to account for this common trend in the residuals and achieved an improved fit to the AWC data. Though significant differences between the three measured regions were identified by the L.E.S. taper model at an alpha level of 0.05, these differences did not translate into any practical differences. Integration of the L.E.S. taper model created an associated compatible volume model for AWC. Estimated total stem volumes from this new volume model and two other simple linear regression total stem volume models were compared to actual total stem volume calculated using Smalian&#226;s equation. Though no practical difference was found to exist between the new volume model and one of the simple linear regression total stem volume models, the new model does allow volumes to be estimated between any two heights or diameters. The models presented in this research should help land managers more accurately assess their stands of AWC.</field><field name="date">2009-06-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06132009-110421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantification via Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) of the Cellular Internalization and Nuclear Localization of Gold Nanoparticles Passivated with BSA-SV40 Large T NLS Conjugates after Incubation with Human Cervical Cancer (HeLa) Cells</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Joseph Anthony</field><field name="description">Rhodamine-labeled, cysteine-modified SV40 large T NLS peptide sequences were conjugated in varying amounts (~ 3 to 15 molar ratio) with bovine serum albuin (BSA) via the heterobifunctional linker succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). These conjugates were then used to passivate nanomolar aliquots of citrate-coated gold nanoparticles of varying diameter (5, 10, 15, and 20 nm), and the stability of these nanoparticle complexes were evaluated with respect to: 1) amount of large T-BSA per nanoparticle (found to be stable under the following BSA:nanoparticle ratios: 5 nm diameter = 125:1, 10 nm diameter = 250:1, 15 nm diameter = 250:1, and 20 nm diameter = 500:1), 2) ionic strength of solution (critical coagulation concentration values above 0.85 M), and 3) temperature (found to be stable at 4, 25, and 37 degrees Celsius). A robust method was developed using inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) as a means to quantify the internalization of nanoparticle complexes after incubation with human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) under many differing conditions. It was determined cellular internalization increased as a function of: 1) increasing amount of large T per nanoparticle complex, 2) longer incubation times, 3) temperature (which is to say incubations at 4 degrees Celsius afforded nearly no internalization), and 4) increasing nanoparticle diameter. Additionally, data from a pulse-chase experiment demonstrated that these nanoparticle complexes tend to remain associated with HeLa cells in similar concentration up to twelve hours after initial exposure. Lastly, a sub-cellular fractionation kit was used to extract nuclei from HeLa cells post-incubation with 5 nm diameter gold nanoparticle complexes. It was observed that nuclear localization of these nanoparticle complexes increased as a function of large T:nanoparticle ratio, but that resulting cell viability decreased dramatically at the highest large T:nanoparticle ratio.</field><field name="date">2009-06-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06132009-145408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Game Theoretic Analysis of a Distribution System in Supply Chain</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Pei-Lun</field><field name="description">We consider a distribution system in which one supplier provides a single product to several retailers at the beginning of a selling season. The supplier has infinite capacity. The customer demand at each retailer is randomly distributed. Customers who encounter a stockout at one retailer may search other retailers for the product. We study the effects of this market search behavior under both decentralized and centralized control. For the decentralized control model, we show the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Nash equilibrium, and the sufficient conditions for its uniqueness. For the centralized control model, we find that the payoff function is submodular, and thus we can only obtain allocations that are locally optimal for the entire supply chain. We also design a channel coordination mechanism to match the allocations in the decentralized control model with one of the local optimal allocations under centralized control.</field><field name="date">2003-06-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06142003-191318/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a genetic linkage map in &lt;I&gt;Abies nordmanniana&lt;/I&gt; accession 9M</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Emily Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Genetic linkage maps have been constructed for many species of conifers; however, none has been previously published for an &lt;i&gt;Abies&lt;/i&gt; species.

The focus of this research is to improve the current state of fundamental understanding regarding how and why the phase behavior of polymer blends changes as pressurized carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is added. The first part of this work provides a broad overview of previous efforts that explore various thermodynamic and kinetic processes involving the use of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in conjunction with multicomponent polymer systems. The following chapters discuss details of research performed primarily on three blend systems: polystyrene (PS)/polyisoprene (PI), poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/ poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/poly(ethylmethylsiloxane) (PEMS). The competing roles of hydrostatic pressure and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dissolution on the phase behavior of both the PS/PI and the PDMS/PEMS blends, which exhibit upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior, are systematically established. Additionally, a complete pseudo-binary temperature-composition phase diagram of the PDMS/PEMS blend is generated as a function of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure. To compare the predictive abilities of the Flory-Huggins and Sanchez-Lacombe equations of state, interaction parameters of the PDMS/PEMS blend are predicted as functions of temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressure. The phase behavior of, as well as intermolecular interactions in, PMMA/PVDF blends have been probed in the presence of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by small-angle neutron and x-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS, respectively). These PMMA/PVDF blends, which display both UCST and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, are also characterized before and after exposure to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by transmission electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, which together confirm the propensity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced PVDF crystallization.</field><field name="date">2003-07-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06152003-142608/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strengthening of Steel Structures with High Modulus Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) Materials</field><field name="creator">Schnerch, David</field><field name="description">Transportation departments and the telecommunications industry are currently demanding cost-effective rehabilitation and/or strengthening techniques for steel structures, including bridges and monopole towers. Rehabilitation is often required due to cross-section losses resulting from corrosion damage and strengthening may be required due to changes in the use of a structure. Current strengthening techniques, have several disadvantages including their cost, need to match the surface configuration of the existing structure, poor fatigue performance and the need for ongoing maintenance due to continued corrosion attack. The current research program makes use of new high modulus types of carbon fiber for strengthening steel structures. The experimental program was developed in four phases. These phases included the selection of suitable resins and adhesives for bonding the CFRP sheets and strips to the steel, characterization the bond to the steel through testing of the development length, performing large-scale tests on strengthened steel monopole towers and also determining the behavior of strengthened steel-concrete composite beams that are typical of bridge structures. The result of the experimental program was the demonstration of sizeable strength and stiffness increases for the steel structures, strengthened with the developed system. Analytical work has also been completed to predict these strength and stiffness increases as well as to determine the bond stresses to ensure the avoidance of a debonding failure, which is detrimental to the effective use of the high modulus CFRP material.</field><field name="date">2005-06-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06152005-090112/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Japanese stiltgrass (&lt;i&gt;Microstegium vimineum&lt;/i&gt;): Population dynamics and management for restoration of native plant communities</field><field name="creator">Judge, Caren Ann</field><field name="description">Japanese stiltgrass is a nonnative invasive grass that occurs in many habitats and is a management concern throughout the eastern United States. Experiments were conducted to address biological and ecological considerations for effective management of Japanese stiltgrass and restoration of native plant communities. Conventional management recommendations emphasize Japanese stiltgrass removal in autumn prior to flowering. Investigations of Japanese stiltgrass reproductive biology were conducted to assess biological considerations that impact such management strategies. Japanese stiltgrass was grown in long day growth chambers (26/22 C) and plants were moved 2, 6, or 10 wk after germination to short day growth chambers (26/22 or 22/18 C). All plants exposed to short days flowered, while under long days no plants flowered. No difference in inflorescence number or shoot dry weight was observed between the two temperature regimes. Japanese stiltgrass populations from North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia flowered similarly in response short day conditions. Furthermore, inflorescences from natural stands of Japanese stiltgrass were harvested four times; one raceme branch beginning to emerge through the leaf sheath, one raceme branch fully elongated and a second branch visible, fully expanded inflorescence, and in concert with natural dispersal. Following &gt; 90 d storage, seed germination from each harvest averaged 13, 51, 95, and 100%, respectively, suggesting management designed to prevent seed production should be implemented before flowering. In forested areas, herbicides that selectively control Japanese stiltgrass while preserving native vegetation may be desired. The efficacy of three selective postemergence herbicides (fenoxaprop-P, imazapic, and sethoxydim) applied early, mid-, or late season were compared. The herbicides, averaged across application timings, controlled Japanese stiltgrass 83 to 89% and reduced seedhead production 79 to 94%. Seedling emergence was reduced 89, 70, and 78% in spring 2004 by fenoxaprop-P, imazapic, and sethoxydim, respectively, applied in 2003. Additionally, fenoxaprop-P or sethoxydim applied twice (4 wk interval) at half-label or full labeled rates controlled Japanese stiltgrass, providing 92% reduction in biomass and 97 to 98% seedhead reduction. Experiments were conducted to determine if Japanese stiltgrass seeds possess dormancy and if so, to determine conditions required to overcome dormancy and for successful germination. Mature Japanese stiltgrass seeds were collected in autumn 2002 and 2003, cold stratified moist at 4 C or stored dry at 21 C, 0 to 90 d. After storage, seeds were incubated in petri dishes in alternating or constant temperatures and exposed to 14 h or 0 h (total dark) photoperiod. Less than 1% of seeds stored 0 or 15 d germinated while &gt; 95% of seeds stored 90 d germinated, suggesting primary innate dormancy upon natural dispersal. A three-year experiment was conducted in two forest sites to document the ecological impacts of conventional and alternative selective management on Japanese stiltgrass populations and native flora recruitment and establishment. Conventional management treatments included hand-pulling, mowing, or glyphosate (1.1 kg ai/ha) applied in autumn compared to hand-pulling or fenoxaprop-P (0.19 kg ai/ha) applied as needed throughout the season. All management treatments significantly reduced Japanese stiltgrass cover and seed bank over time compared to no management and decreases in relative Japanese stiltgrass cover and seed bank populations were greater in 2004 than 2003, after two seasons of management. However, selective management was more suitable than nonselective management or no management for recruitment and re-establishment of native plants and increasing overall species richness. Additionally, relative cover of other exotic plants decreased 6% over time, suggesting that removal of Japanese stiltgrass did not increase invasion of other exotic plant species.</field><field name="date">2005-07-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06152005-111943/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential thrombospondin expression on T lymphocytes in a Feline Immunodeficiency Virus model</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Melinda Cadd</field><field name="description">CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells represent an important subset of lymphocytes whose function is to suppress autoimmune disease and control normal immune responses. There is much research indicating a direct role for TGF-beta expressed on the surface of Tregs in the suppressor function of these cells. TGF-beta, whether bound to the cell surface or secreted, is produced as part of a complex that renders the cytokine inactive. Thrombospondin is the primary activator of biologically latent TGF-beta. This research demonstrates that thrombospondin is expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes isolated from the blood and lymph nodes of normal and FIV positive felines. Thrombospondin is expressed at significantly higher levels on CD4+CD25+ T lymphocytes, but can be induced in culture by activating T helper cells in the presence of LPS and IL2. We also observed that the CD4+CD25- T helper cells isolated from FIV negative control lymph nodes were able to markedly upregulate surface thrombospondin expression compared with similarly stimulated CD4+CD25- T helper cells from FIV positive sources. These findings are initial steps in working to understand the mechanism behind latent TGF-beta activation on CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells and the role this cell type plays in FIV/HIV pathogenesis.</field><field name="date">2007-08-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06152007-103921/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of a Transport Layer Protocol for 4G Wireless Systems, Mobility</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Meeta</field><field name="description">Mobility computing is the network-access paradigm of the future. Future network protocols will be 4G defined over an entirely packet-switched network with digital network elements, high bandwidth and built-in network security. The bandwidth provided will be 100Mbps for stationary objects and 20 Mbps while in motion. 4G wireless networks will support global roaming and service portability across multiple wireless and mobile networks, for example from a cellular network to a satellite-based network to a high-bandwidth wireless LAN. TCP Performance degrades severely on a wireless link due to higher Bit Error Rate, Mobility, Limited Capacity, Non Uniform Error Profile and frequent Disconnections. We propose a new transport layer protocol for 4G Wireless Systems, compatible with the existing TCP/ IP implementations that combines the best of the currently proposed algorithms and our own new congestion control algorithm. We designed an optimized congestion control algorithm for the wireless link that provides connection oriented, reliable data service with graceful handovers and ability to recover from frequent disconnections. The protocol deals with high bit error rate by implementing split connections with local fast retransmissions. It uses Zero Window Advertisement to accomplish smooth handover under inter-wireless cell mobility. Several other methods have been proposed to overcome TCP-over-wireless faults including split-TCP connection, triple-acknowledgements and acknowledgment caching. Each of these methods improves the efficiency of TCP by improving a single fault aspect, while our proposal combines compatible improvements into an efficient and reliable protocol.</field><field name="date">2003-06-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06162003-162847/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Essence of Centennial Campus: A Public/Private Strategic Alliance that Responds to Corporate Core Values of Innovation</field><field name="creator">Helmlinger, Teresa A</field><field name="description">Evidence suggests that public research universities, especially land grant institutions, can be instrumental in supporting a new kind of economic vitality.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of soil P status and the P composition of manure sources on P in runoff, characterize the effects of manure sources on mass loss of dissolved reactive P (DRP), total dissolved P (TDP), algal available P (AAP) and total P (TP) in runoff, and enhance the PLAT database with respect to soluble P attenuating factor (SPAF) and non-soluble P attenuating factor (NSPAF) values. Soil boxes set at 5% slopes received 7.5 cm hr-1 of simulated rainfall. Study soils included a Kenansville loamy sand (loamy siliceous subactive thermic Arenic Hapludults, a Coastal Plain soil) and a Davidson silt loam (kaolinitic thermic Rhodic Kandiudults, a Piedmont soil). Soil test P concentrations ranged from 16 to 283 mg P kg-1. Sources of P included broiler litter (BRL), breeder manure (BRD), breeder manure treated with three rates of alum (Al2(SO4)3) BRD0-0 kg m-2, BRDL-3.9 kg m-2, and BRDH-7.8 kg m-2 and DAP along with an unamended control. All manure sources were applied at 66 kg P ha-1. Water extractable P (WEP) represented an average of 10 ?b 6% total P in manure. Runoff samples were taken over a 30-min period. Piedmont soil contained greater amounts of clay, Al and Fe concentrations, and higher P sorption capacities that produced significantly lower DRP, TDP, AAP, and TP losses than the Coastal Plain soil. Runoff P loss did not differ for low and high STP soils of same taxonomy with the exception of AAP mass losses for Coastal Plain soil samples. Water extractable P in manures accounted for all DRP lost in runoff with DRP correlating strongly with WEP concentration (0.9961). A weak relationship between DRP in runoff and WEP applied to soil boxes was observed (R2=0.6547) and increased when a possible outlying manure treatment, BRL, was omitted from regression data (0.9927). Overall, manures containing the highest WEP concentrations supplied the largest losses of DRP in runoff. Manure treated with 3.9 and 7.8 kg m-2 of Al2(SO4)3 (alum) decreased DRP in runoff by 29%. Values calculated for PLAT SPAF and NSPAF coefficients were higher for Coastal Plain soil than Piedmont soil and overall higher than default values in PLAT. Management based on these results should help minimize harmful effects of P in runoff.</field><field name="date">2005-07-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06162005-123000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and Analytical Investigation into the Non-Linear Behavior of 2" and 4", 90 degree, Large Radius, Schedule 10, Stainless Steel Elbows Under Monotonic, Cyclic and Rate Dependent Loading</field><field name="creator">Wilkins, James Kevin</field><field name="description">This study investigates the behavior of stainless steel, butt welded elbows under a variety of loading conditions. The out-of-plane performance of 2 inch, schedule 10 elbows was examined and compared with analyses obtained from ANSYS using element SHELL181. The correlations between measured and simulated curves for load vs. displacement and strains were excellent. Also, the in-plane experimental behavior of 4 inch, schedule 10 elbows was examined and compared with SHELL181 analysis results for both opening and closing modes. In general, the correlation was quite good for both the global behavior and the local strain measures. The cyclic behavior of 2 inch, schedule 10 elbows was also measured. A one and three-fourths cycle test on a 2 inch, schedule 10 elbow was performed and compared with SHELL181 using both kinematic and isotropic hardening rules. The first quarter cycle performance of both analyses was quite good, but as deformation continued the isotropic results deviated significantly while the kinematic results remained quite good. Finally, the effect of loading rate on 4 inch, schedule 10 elbows was examined for the in-plane closing. The specimens were loaded at 0.5 mm/sec, 5 mm/sec and 50 mm/sec. With an increase in closure rate, an increased deviation from the analytical results was observed. By taking strain rate hardening effect into account the correlation improved greatly. The initial conclusion from these tests is that SHELL181 can provide excellent correlation under quasi-static loading, but at faster rates the effect of strain rate hardening may need to be implemented in the FEA.</field><field name="date">2002-06-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06172002-125348/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing Student Understanding of Measurement and Uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Abbott, David Scot</field><field name="description">A test to assess student understanding of measurement and uncertainty has been developed and administered to more than 500 students at two large research universities. The aim is two-fold: 1) to assess what students learn in the first semester of introductory physics labs and 2) to uncover patterns in student reasoning and practice. The forty minute, eleven item test focuses on direct measurement and student attitudes toward multiple measurements. After one revision cycle using think-aloud interviews, the test was administered to students to three groups: students enrolled in traditional laboratory lab sections of first semester physics at North Carolina State University (NCSU), students in an experimental (SCALE-UP) section of first semester physics at NCSU, and students in first semester physics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The results were analyzed using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods. In the traditional NCSU labs, where students receive no instruction in uncertainty and measurement, students show no improvement on any of the areas examined by the test. In SCALE-UP and at UNC, students show statistically significant gains in most areas of the test. Gains on specific test items in SCALE-UP and at UNC correspond to areas of instructional emphasis. Test items were grouped into four main aspects of performance: ?point/set? reasoning, meaning of spread, ruler reading and ?stacking.? Student performance on the pretest was examined to identify links between these aspects. Items within each aspect are correlated to one another, sometimes quite strongly, but items from different aspects rarely show statistically significant correlation. Taken together, these results suggest that student difficulties may not be linked to a single underlying cause. The study shows that current instruction techniques improve student understanding, but that many students exit the introductory physics lab course without appreciation or coherent understanding for the concept of measurement uncertainty.</field><field name="date">2003-06-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06172003-143358/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rationality Unveiled: Philosophy and Practices in a Hospice Organization</field><field name="creator">Monahan, Molly Bernice</field><field name="description">The modern hospice movement began in the 1960s as a response to the rationalization of care for the dying. Ironically, however, hospice organizations have themselves become increasingly rationalized over time, with the advent of Medicare certification and conventional accreditation practices. Despite this, contemporary hospice practitioners must still attempt to follow the holistic philosophy which originally made hospice unique. Thus, they encounter a dilemma of trying to enact an alternative philosophy while being tied to the conventional. This dissertation is a case study of a hospice organization in the Southeastern United States ("Hometown Hospice"). I use observational and interview data to illustrate the rationalization process and discuss its consequences for hospice practitioners. I show how the attempt to follow an alternative medical philosophy while also pleasing regulatory bodies created mixed messages for front-line workers at this organization. Next, I discuss how the workers used humor to manage the unpleasant emotions that resulted from this dilemma. I then discuss how Hometown Hospice perpetuated racial and class inequalities common throughout health care, despite their interdisciplinary team approach to fulfilling the philosophy of holistic care. I conclude with a discussion of other sites where the dilemma between philosophy and expected practices occurs.</field><field name="date">2003-06-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-06172003-165404/</field></doc></add>
