At the centre of this thesis is a focus on forming a connection between critical postmodern social work theory and liberation spirituality. Liberation spirituality is a framework proposed by Joel Kovel which has at its heart connects emancipation and spirituality.    My first chapter outlines my research approach. Chapter two explores the diversity and complexity of spiritual meanings, examines the influence of the western context on spirituality, analyses the relationship between language and spirituality, and outlines my assumptions in relation to spirituality. Chapter three examines the historical and social context influencing social workers' engagement with spiritual issues. It also explores the engagement of current social work literature with issues of spirituality.    Chapters four and five consider distinctions between critical social work in the modernist tradition, and critical postmodern social work. This establishes why critical postmodern social work approaches are more suited to engage with spiritual issues. The conceptual connection between critical postmodern social work and liberation spirituality is explored in chapter six and chapter seven. The latter in particular includes a detailed examination of the relationship between emancipatory politics and spirituality. The thesis concludes in chapter eight by analysing implications of this conceptual connection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical social work and spirituality</field><field name="subject">critical social work and liberation spirituality</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080722.143340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative Characterisation of Airborne Electromagnetic Systems</field><field name="creator">Davis, Aaron Charles</field><field name="description">I address the geometric problem of the pendulum-like swinging of towed birds for AEM platforms.  I establish a link between actual observed bird swing and its effect on survey data for two different systems and explain the link by a model that compares actual survey data to the calculated mutual inductance coupling of a dipole pair over an infinitely conductive half space, which pair is permitted arbitrary pitch, roll and altitude changes.  I develop a non-linear filter that removes bird swing effects from survey data which successfully corrected data from 3 different AEM surveys.      Calibration of several different time domain AEM systems is attempted using an accurately laid out and surveyed, closed, multi-turn loop of known resistance and self-inductance that is placed on - but insulated from - resistive ground.  I derive a rigourous mathematical model that predicts airborne receiver's response to the coupling to the transmitter current waveform and total system geometry.  The method was proven to be successful over resistive ground, with significant system problems identified such as: altimetry error, spatial averaging of data during postprocessing, error in the predicted horizontal position of the AEM platform, receiver windowing and timing errors and bird swing. I show that, although we can calibrate a time domain AEM system for a single flyover, it is impossible to calibrate an AEM system for geometry.  As an intermediate step in the calibration process, I show that by monitoring the current induced in the ground loop we can obtain the waveform of the AEM transmitter current throu gh deconvolution in the Fourier domain.      Simple and cost effective methods for the improvement of quantitative AEM data are presented in this thesis.  However, until the geometry problem of AEM platforms is solved, full system calibration will not be obtained and filters will need to be applied to the data.  I recommend the use of: GPS antennas mounted on all towed birds, able to be post-processed for accurate position recovery, reliable bird-mounted scanning altimeters that do not rely on range-finding technology but instead employ a shortest path algorithm, pitch and roll sensors mounted on the trailed bird and the measurement of airspeed of both the towed bird and the aircraft during surveys.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electromagnetics</field><field name="subject">airborne</field><field name="subject">time domain</field><field name="subject">frequency domain</field><field name="subject">ground loop</field><field name="subject">calibration</field><field name="subject">bird swing</field><field name="subject">mutual inductance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080723.103030</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Acupuncture on Temporal Summation of Pain: A Randomised,   Double-Blind, Sham-Controlled Study</field><field name="creator">Feng, Jian Qiang / Sam</field><field name="description">There was few human study evaluated the analgesic effect of acupuncture on central   nervous system (CNS). The electrical temporal summation (TS) pain model has been   validated and provides the opportunity to study the central inhibition effect of   acupuncture in healthy humans. The present study aimed to: 1. systematically review   available randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture on experimentally   induced pain in healthy humans; 2. conduct a RCT to assess the effect of manual   acupuncture (MA) and electro-acupuncture (EA) on TS of pain and the spatial (i.e. the   local and remote sites to acupuncture stimulation) and the temporal (i.e. immediately   after and 24-hours after the intervention) characteristics of this effect. The systematic   review was carried out in accordance with the requirements of a Cochrane Systematic   Review. The methodological quality and credibility of the acupuncture intervention of   the included RCTs were assessed. The Review Management software (RevMan   version 4.2, The Cochrane Library) was used for data extraction and data analysis. 605   papers were identified from four databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and   EMBASE). Only nine papers met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality   and credibility of the acupuncture invention were satisfactory. The pain models and   interventions applied varied substantially from study to study. Consequently,   meta-analyses were not conducted. Comparing acupuncture with non-invasive   control, significant acupuncture analgesia was reported. These studies also   demonstrated that invasive controls produced analgesia. For the RCT of acupuncture   on TS, 27 healthy volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to either EA, MA   or sham-acupuncture (SA) group, with nine volunteers in each group. To test pain   thresholds, transcutaneous electrical stimulation was delivered to two sites on the   anterior aspects of both legs and one site on the dorsum of the non-dominant forearm.   Pain thresholds to single electrical stimulation (SPT) and to TS stimulation (TST)   were assessed before, 30-minutes after and 24-hours after the intervention.   Acupuncture was given to Zusanli (ST36) and Fenglong (ST 40) on the dominant leg.   The level of anxiety was assessed before and after acupuncture with Spielberg State   and Anxiety Inventory. The three groups were comparable at baseline. The level of   anxiety did not change significantly after acupuncture. EA significantly increased SPT   and TST on the treatment leg 24-hour after the treatment when compared with SA (p less than    0.05), but did not increase those measured on the non-treatment leg or the forearm.   The fact that such an effect increased within 24 hours after acupuncture might indicate   the potential role of neurohumoral mechanisms in acupuncture analgesia. The   analgesia effect of EA on TS tended to be localised at the needling site. This   observation is different from the understanding of the wide-spread effect of   acupuncture. The discrepancy could be due to the small sample size of the current   study. In conclusion, this is the first study that demonstrates EA elicits a strong   inhibition on the CNS in health humans. Such a central effect lasts more than 24 hours,   and limits to the site where acupuncture is applied. These findings need to be   confirmed in other TS models.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Temporal summation</field><field name="subject">acupuncture</field><field name="subject">analgesia</field><field name="subject">central sensitisation</field><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080723.115945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand Dressmaker: Experiences, Practices and Contribution to Fashionability, 1940 to 1980.</field><field name="creator">Hamon, Janis Marion</field><field name="description">The rationale behind the research presented in this thesis grew from a perception that, historically, work that was seen to be</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dressmaker</field><field name="subject">Dressmaking</field><field name="subject">Fashion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080723.161409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engaging Space: A practice of arranging</field><field name="creator">Lim, Sharn Selina</field><field name="description">Engaging Space focuses on arranging as means to engage with space.

It impacts on patients' Quality of Life (QoL), including working ability, daily functioning, sleep and psychological well-being. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that acupuncture was beneficial for patients with PAWS. However the overall effect of acupuncture on these patients' QoL is unknown.        Aims: The current study aimed to conduct a systematic review (SR) of clinical trials to determine the effect of acupuncture on QoL and pain for patients with PAWS. In addition, a narrative review (NR) was conducted to compare patients' perceived changes (PCC) with the standard QoL instruments used in acupuncture clinical trials for pain.         Methods: For the SR, PubMed, Embase (via ScienceDirect), CINAHL (Via EBSCO) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture for PAWS condition(s) that include both QoL and pain assessments with a Jadad score of three or greater were included.       For the NR, PubMed was searched to identify studies reporting PPC after acupuncture and/or traditional Chinese medicine. Extracted data were grouped and compared with domains of the QoL instruments.      Results: In total, 21 RCTs were included and 17 of them had sufficient data for analysis. QoL was measured using 15 different instruments. Randomisation procedures and dropouts were adequately reported in all 17 studies.       Four studies compared acupuncture with wait-list or usual-care. Two demonstrated that acupuncture had a superior effect on improving physical and mental components of QoL measured by Short Form-36 health survey questionnaire and pain at the three month follow-up.       Studies comparing acupuncture with sham/placebo acupuncture or placebo-TENS found either no difference between the treatments or conflicting results.      When acupuncture was compared with active interventions, there was no difference except that at the intermediate-term follow-up massage was better for disability and pain and physiotherapy was better for Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire.  Acupuncture was also better than TENS for pain.      The combined therapy of acupuncture and an active intervention showed a superior result than the latter alone in the short-term.       Six studies were identified for the NR. Patients reported 11 categories of changes after acupuncture, such as reduced reliance on other therapies, enhanced spirituality, prevention of disease. However, these clinical outcomes were not included in any of the QoL instruments used in the included RCTs.         Conclusion: There is moderate to strong evidence that acupuncture is more effective than wait-list or usual-care at the short-term follow-up in improving QoL of patients with PAWS. When acupuncture is combined with another therapy, the combined therapy seems to produce a better outcome. Acupuncture is not better than sham/placebo acupuncture or placebo-TENS. Surprisingly, the commonly used QoL instruments do not measure all the changes perceived by patients as a result of acupuncture and/or traditional Chinese medicine.      There is a pressing need to design QoL assessments that are suitable for acupuncture research. Further studies should have larger sample sizes and additional validated outcome assessments are required to detect effects of acupuncture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture</field><field name="subject">pain associated with the spine</field><field name="subject">neck pain</field><field name="subject">lower back pain</field><field name="subject">Quality of life</field><field name="subject">patient perceived changes</field><field name="subject">systematic review</field><field name="subject">traditional Chinese medicine.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080724.122432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of SiC Based Field Effect Sensors with Gas Sensitive Metal Oxide Layers for Hydrogen and Hydrocarbon Gas Sensing at High Temperatures</field><field name="creator">Kandasamy, Sasikaran</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis sets out to investigate novel Silicon Carbide (SiC) based field effect devices (Schottky and transistor structures), with gas sensitive layers for monitoring hydrogen and propene gases at high temperatures. The devices developed by the author were shown to exhibit sensitivities at least 1~2 orders of magnitude (voltage shift, &#131;&#162;V) higher than those reported in literature. Not only did the author seek to investigate the gas sensing potential of such devices, but also he set out to study, analyse and establish the gas interaction mechanism of these novel sensors.      High temperature tolerant hydrogen and hydrocarbon sensors are required in numerous applications such as: aerospace, nuclear power plant, space exploration and exhaust monitoring in automobiles. Monitoring these gases in a reliable and efficient manner is of great value in these applications, not only from a safety point of view but also for economical reasons. Hence there is an absolute necessity for simple, efficient and high performance sensors not only for monitoring and leak detection but also to function as part of a safety device to prevent accidents. The proposed sensor structure of combining SiC with gas sensitive oxide layers allow them to be operated at high temperatures, making them extremely appealing for direct or in-situ monitoring applications.       The microstructural analysis performed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS) provides no evidence of inter-diffusion between different layers, in spite of the sensors being annealing at 650&#129;&#139; in O2, H2 and C3H6 atmospheres for approximately 50hrs. Samples in different conditions (as deposited, annealed and tested) were compared. The electrical properties of the MROSiC (current-voltage, I-V and capacitance-voltage, C-V characteristics) and MESFET (drain current-source drain voltage (ID-VSD) and transfer, (&#129;&#227;ID-H2 concentration) characteristics) devices were measured in the presence and absence of H2 and C3H6. Several parameters such as barrier height, saturation currents, pinch-off voltages and channel conductance were determined from the electrical characteristics, and their influence on the device performance was studied.       The author&#129;fs proposed gas interaction model based on energy band diagram is well supported by the experimental data obtained.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Field effect</field><field name="subject">SiC</field><field name="subject">MROSiC</field><field name="subject">MESFET</field><field name="subject">Sensor</field><field name="subject">gas</field><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080724.142015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mynewhome.com.au: Exploring New Ways of Delivering Architecture;- Creating a Design Interface for Sustainable and Affordable Houses</field><field name="creator">Naumann, Stefan</field><field name="description">Stefan Naumann                                                               Master of Architecture      Mynewhome.com.au      Exploring New Ways of Delivering Architecture;- Creating a Design Interface for Sustainable and Affordable Houses      The aim of this research project was to explore new ways of delivering architecture and the engagement of architects in everyday, affordable, sustainable housing in Australia.       This dissertation speculates on the possibility of a design system integrated with a design interface, where customers can self-configure or customise their home online with the help of embedded programs and an architect consultancy service. This can be seen as an alternative option for the homebuyer to the volume built, standard house.   The design system displayed in this masters research was developed in three testing modes: speculative designs, site specific designs and user experiments.     The system consists of modules and components that would have the embedded knowledge of the architect. They are intended to allow non professionals to self-arrange their homes.   This was then integrated into a user interface. A construction system which allows prefabrication was then applied, but the main focus of the research was on the delivery of design and client engagement and not on the technicalities, or the realisation of a prefab system.      The aim was to combine as much of the quality and advantages of a one off architecturally designed house, in particular, the consideration of user and site needs with the affordability and predictability of a completely pre-designed volume builder house.      Digital design, production and marketing have the potential to make this challenge a success. This new digital way of delivering architecture could lead to houses that are more adaptable to different users and site needs than volume builder housing.   The knowledge of the architect could be applied to ordinary housing, without the huge financial cost of the one off, architect designed house.   The web based interface would allow customer interaction as tested in user experiments.    The internet widens the possibility of the clients' involvement in the design process.   These new online procurement processes are more instant and accessible and could result in an enlightened purchaser.   There is the possibility to educate people, so informed decisions could be made.    It could lead to houses with better orientation, engagement with new building materials, prefabrication technologies and the promotion of smaller houses resulting in more sustainable homes that are still reasonable in price.      This is a very complex issue in which different experts would have to work together.   However, there is a real possibility for a design interface to open up a dialogue between the architect and the general public.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design Interface</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">Affordable Houses</field><field name="subject">Prefab</field><field name="subject">Design System</field><field name="subject">Modular</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080724.162129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheology Of Peroxide Modified Recycled High Density Polyethylene</field><field name="creator">Parmar, Harisinh</field><field name="description">Consumption of plastics has increased exponentially, in line with the world's population. Not surprisingly this is reflected in enormous growth of the plastic industry especially during the last five decades. Commensurate with this, waste produced from plastics consumption has created a major environmental problem. Many types of waste disposal methods have been used all over the world so far, but all of them have disadvantages. Furthermore, some methods are responsible for the generation of green house gases and further contribution to global warming. Recently, reduction of green house gas emission has become a target of most industries. Plastic recycling and reuse breaks the cycle of endless production of virgin polymer and thus contributes to a net reduction of green house gas emission.       Recycling of plastics should produce materials with improved properties to replace virgin plastics for a variety of applications. Improvement in the properties of recycled plastics can be achieved by blending with other plastics, by filler addition and by modification using free radical initiators. Introduction of the free radical initiator (organic peroxide) during reprocessing of the recycled plastics has been found to offer significant property improvements to the recycled materials. Extremely small amounts of a free radical initiator (typically ranging between 0.01 wt% to 0.2 wt%) is capable of enhancing the properties of the recycled plastics to a great extent.       This project investigates the use of free radical initiators in the recycling of post consumer recycled high density polyethylene using reactive extrusion. Both molecular and rheological characterisation of recycled and reprocessed materials was carried out and this was followed by tensile testing of the modified materials to satisfy end use applications such as packaging and drainage piping.      Post consumer recycled high density polyethylene (R-HDPE) resin and virgin high density polyethylene (V-HDPE) were reactively extruded with low concentrations of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) and 1, 3 1, 4 Bis (tert- butylperoxyisopropyl) Benzene (OP2) respectively in a twin screw extruder in order to produce modified materials with varying composition (0.0 wt%, 0.02 wt%, 0.05 wt%, 0.07 wt%, 0.10 wt% and 0.15 wt%) of both organic peroxides. Morphological characterisation using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) demonstrated that there is a decrease in the crystallinity level for all the modified samples.       Shear rheological tests were carried out to study the structure of the modified materials within the linear viscoelastic region.

In fact, a lack of trust discourages consumers from making purchases over the Internet. Previous research was set out to address this issue; however, the findings were benefited by academia rather than by e-vendors, and this becomes the gap in this topic.   This research was aimed to develop guideline to foster consumer trust and purchase intention to shop online for e-vendors. It was achieved by using mixed methods: quantitative and qualitative studies. In the quantitative study, an online survey was created as an instrument for capturing attitude of consumers related to trust in B2C e-commerce in a global scale. The survey data was then collated and analysed with structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings from the quantitative study were subsequently confirmed with the qualitative study, which was accomplished by conducting focus group analysis. Interpretive analysis was used to analyse the data captured from the focus groups. Also, new findings were identified in this study to further enhance consumer trust.   By comparing the findings from both quantitative and qualitative studies, contribution of this research is to enable e-vendors to foster trust in B2C e-commerce based on three aspects: e-vendor's elements, affiliating parties and e-vendor's record. For e-vendor's elements, this research identifies that privacy should be provided to consumers; secure transactions, secure servers and sophisticated authentication systems should be supported; e-commerce websites should be well-designed; consumers' request should be honoured; privacy statements, trusted seals and return policies should be made available on e-commerce websites; online communities should be incorporated; proof of real business should be easily identified; and, e-vendors should establish good communication with their potential customers. For affiliating parties, this research finds that e-vendors should associate with financial intermediaries and trusted third parties to further gain trust from consumers. Finally, for e-vendor's record, this researc h reveals that e-vendors should maintain good relationships with their customers in order to build good business records that potentially encourage more consumers to make purchases with them. In addition, the contribution to the body of knowledge from this research is a new direction of how to address trust issues in B2C e-commerce, which can be further explored in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">B2C</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080725.101739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape as Caricature?</field><field name="creator">Qiu, Lingling</field><field name="description">Can Landscape be created like a caricature? How can the key characteristics of a site be celebrated in different ways through design? Can potential design possibilities be generated through celebrating the key characteristics of a site's contexts?      My research started with the idea of 'Identity', as the existing Central Plaza copies the physical form of an adjacent park (People's Park) in a simplistic way without considering its own unique key contexts, and I think every location and context is different. Careful consideration of both physical and cultural contexts is what a landscape architect undertakes as an essential part of developing a design, however, how can a stronger or more interesting idea be created for a specific site? One day, the idea of CARICATURE suddenly occurred to me when I was having a shower. What I find inspirational about caricature is the aspect of 'Celebration' which it encourages.      Just as a site has unique characteristics and each of them can be celebrated differently, each caricature celebrates the particular physical and emotional characteristics of a single, unique original identity. Each successful caricature can be related clearly to the key characteristics of its own identity, so you can still recognize the person and you are encouraged to have fun as well in that game of recognition. By 'Celebration' I mean the carefully chosen, positive exaggeration, intensification and emphasis of key characteristics which reveal how good, how important, or how unique the site is. 'Celebration' is an act of revealing and sharing the positive potential qualities of a site. In terms of landscape design, what I sought to do is to reinforce the key qualities of my site through design or designs which would emphasize.      If landscape is thought about and designed like caricatures are created, interesting or potential possibilities could be generated for design responses. Before celebrating, it is necessary to make sure that the site contexts have been fully analyzed and understood. After that, we can celebrate particular qualities through design.      I have produced three different designs based on the conceptual idea of 'caricature'. They are called Topopark, Occupark and Tocopark. Topopark started from a focus on one of the physical context of the site - that is, its topography. It celebrates the topographic context as well as the relationship of the activities between and beneath Central Plaza and People's Park. Occupark focuses on the celebration of the various types of occupation activities which take place. Tocopark started around the possibility of generating the plaza's organisation from the organization of circulation systems and combines to celebrate both topography and active occupation. Although Tocopark is more intensive than Topopark and Occupark in terms of the idea of celebration, all three have different strengthens and weaknesses. Like the example of the caricatures of Ronaldinho, the same identity is celebrated in different ways, but you still can recognize him in each one and enjoy them equally as well, because all of them relate to t he key characteristics of his appearance and personality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Caricature</field><field name="subject">Key Contexts</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Celebration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080725.120217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheology of Shear Thickening Mineral Slurries.</field><field name="creator">Shah, Ashish</field><field name="description">Abstract         In order to improve the optimisation of mineral processing operations the rheological properties of slurries must be determined as accurately as possible under the conditions that closely resemble actual site conditions. The rheology of particles suspended in Newtonian fluids is well documented. However, the rheology of particles in non-Newtonian fluids has not been the subject of much investigation till now. The work conducted here attempts to fill this gap in knowledge.      The rheological properties of slurries are heavily dependent on the solids concentrations and particle-solid interaction. At low solids concentrations, constant viscosity and Newtonian behaviour is observed, but as solids concentration increases the rheological behaviour becomes increasingly complex and non-Newtonian with viscosity becoming dependent on the shear rate. The nature of the non-Newtonian behaviour depends on the solid concentration, particle shape, particle size, particle size distribution and the suspending liquid rheological properties. The suspension/slurry may develop a yield stress and become time dependent in nature as structures develop within the fluid at higher solids concentrations. This study however, is primarily focused on the measurement of the rheological properties, where it is assumed that the fluid will be fully sheared and that the rheological properties will be unlikely to change with time.       Shear thickening behaviour of slurries was the focus of this work. The aim was to investigate the slurry concentration region where shear thickening occurs.    The first objective of the project was to develop a fluid analogue which will have similar rheological behaviour to that of concentrated tailings from gold mines so that it can be used as a test material to simulate the flow behaviour of the tailings in a pipe. The second objective of this project was to enable the prediction of flow behaviour in the pipe loop under certain conditions using the fluid analogue for slurry from Sunrise dam.      In order to achieve the objectives, experiments were carried out to obtain a fluid analogue of a shear thickening slurry. CSL 500 and SR 200 rheometers were used for the characterisation of different fluid analogues and shear thickening mineral slurries. Malvern Sizer, model: mastersizerX v1.1, was used to obtain particle size distributions. A mini pipe loop system, located in the laboratory of the Rheology and Materials Processing Centre (RMPC) was used to get pipe line flow data for comparison with the rheometer data.         A few fluid analogues with different suspending medium and different concentrations of glass spheres was tested before finally using, 48 vol% glass spheres in 1.8 wt% CMC solution as a fluid analogue for the mineral tailings obtained from Sunrise dam, WA. For comparison between the pipe line and rheometer data, all pipe line data (in the form of 8V/D) were converted to rheometer data (in the form of du/dr) using the Robinowitsch-Mooney equation.       The above comparison indicated that it is possible to produce fluid analogue to simulate the flow behaviour of Sunrise dam slurry using a shear thinning suspending medium with high concentration of glass particles.

Whilst this research has produced relevant and useful results, there are several properties of high strength concrete like compressive and tensile strengths, stiffness, durability etc. that need to be evaluated and investigated to determine an accurate representation for the determination of different structural properties of beams made of high strength concrete.      For this purpose, an investigation into the behaviour of beams made of higher concrete strengths has been carried out and conclusions drawn for the design of high strength concrete beams in flexure. Experimental data from previous research was considered for the study to establish some understanding of flexural behavior of HSC beams. A number of spreadsheets in Excel were developed using available data and various graphs were plotted to determine the accuracy of the code provisions for calculating the ultimate moment capacity of beams.       A study on flexural ductility of beams has been carried out using a computer program FRMPHI which generates moment-curvature curves for the beams. Ductility has been studied using ductility factors. The influence of ductility on the value of the depth of neutral axis has been analysed and discussed.       A chapter on the short-term deflection of simply supported high strength concrete beams under instantaneous deflections is presented. This chapter includes analysis of the available formula to calculate deflection to determine if these can be adopted for high strength concrete.       Extensive ongoing research on the shear strength of beams by several researchers since many years has lead to the generation of a large body of knowledge. Although each author has analysed the data comparing them with existing relationships, the whole body of information has not been analysed to establish a statistical significance. In this study, regression analysis on experimental data collected from published research is carried a relationship between the different parameters affecting the shear strength of beams. The level of significance of the association between parameters influencing shear strength is also discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High strength concrete</field><field name="subject">beams</field><field name="subject">stress block parameters</field><field name="subject">ductility</field><field name="subject">short-term deflection</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080725.143153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Emotional Intelligence in Project Management as a Measure of Performance</field><field name="creator">Turner, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Dr. Turner investigates whether an awareness of Emotional Intelligence competencies (EC) will impact the levels of job satisfaction and general job performance of the individual project team member as a predictor of project outcome.    She undertook and constructed an empirical research project based on a project team EC enrichment framework.  EC Team enrichment advocates the development of emotional competencies to achieve measurable improvements in job satisfaction and performance.  The research was conducted in the United States defense industry environment and surveyed the project team members of a large-scale, dynamic project.     This study was experimental in nature and the research was based on a quantitative approach tailored to minimize threats to validity through the use of a control group.  Additionally, it involved elements of related qualitative research to interpret findings.  An empirically-based, working hypothesis was presented to the effect that, a greater potential of project success can be realized by introducing information on emotional development to enhance behavioral competencies of all project team members.  The case study included three distinct phases for pretest, treatment, and post-test.  Results support the concept that an introduction to the concept of emotional intelligence can have a statistically significant impact on project performance through improvement of individual ratings for job satisfaction and professional performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotional Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Project Management</field><field name="subject">Competencies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080725.162405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Internationalisation of Higher Education in Thailand: Case Studies of Two English-Medium Business Graduate Programs</field><field name="creator">Chalapati, Supaporn</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses the impact of economic globalisation on Thai higher education and society. Thailand's severe economic crisis in the second half of 1997 through 1998 has led to education reform at all levels. Since the crisis, Thailand has been focusing on the development of its human potential and creativity and enhancing the capability of communities, societies and the nation as a whole. The education system of Thailand is being redirected away from nation-building objectives towards 'human capital' creation; education is seen as a form of economic investment.   Thailand, like its industrialising neighbours in Southeast Asia and close Western neighbours, is striving to adjust to the pressures of economic globalisation. As a result, Thailand's higher education system is undergoing significant intellectual and strategic reorientation to meet the demands of the modern global economy.  Urged by government and employers to produce graduates with more globally relevant knowledge and skills, Thai universities are attempting to redefine their relevance with increased emphasis on proficiency in English. This imperative explains the expansion of full-fee English-medium education and the emergence of government policies encouraging the internationalisation of curricula.    Since the mid-1990s, successive Thai governments have paid some attention to the concept of internationalisation but have yet to produce a clear statement of what internationalisation means in the Thai context. Thailand's internationalisation policy, such as it is, aims to cultivate a globally skilled workforce and has directly encouraged the establishment of English-medium business graduate programs, branded as 'international' at a number of leading universities in Bangkok. This thesis examines concerns as to the level of English proficiency achieved by students passing through these programs and questions the appropriateness of the term 'international' for programs, many of which appear to be cloned from business studies degrees offered in major native English-speaking countries.   While government policies assert the need to reform education at all levels, both the idea and the parameters of 'internationalisation' remain ill-defined. Consequently, this thesis maps out the scope of internationalisation in education from a global and a local Thai perspective to present a more integrated framework for analysing the implications of the policies. The approach taken presents a multilayered and holistic reading of significant economic and cultural change taking place in Thailand through the lens of higher education reforms and public debates about globalisation and education. More specifically, this thesis examines internationalisation of Thai higher education as an aspect of globalisation and 'global' practice at the 'local' level, observable in the policies, statements, actions and intentions expressed by political leaders, government officials, university administrators, teachers, students and employers. Significantly, Thai cultural characteristics have a profound impact on these key acto rs' attitudes towards practice of international education, particularly in the cross-cultural teaching and learning settings. This thesis argues that a more holistic and integrated approach to internationalisation across all related policy domains is needed if the country is to more effectively respond to the challenges of a globalising world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalisation</field><field name="subject">Internationalisation</field><field name="subject">International business</field><field name="subject">Business education</field><field name="subject">Curriculum design</field><field name="subject">Public policy</field><field name="subject">Higher education policy</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Thai culture</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="subject">English-medium</field><field name="subject">ESL</field><field name="subject">Business English</field><field name="subject">Graduate education</field><field name="subject">International</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">international education market</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080729.145018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sino-American Relations and D&#233;tente: Nixon, Kissinger, Mao and the One-China Policy, with special reference to Taiwan</field><field name="creator">Hsu, ChunYen</field><field name="description">This thesis is essentially about the origin, course, and impact of</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">One-China Policy</field><field name="subject">Kissinger</field><field name="subject">Nixon</field><field name="subject">Mao</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080729.155910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key distribution and distributed intrusion detection system in wireless sensor network</field><field name="creator">Techateerawat, Piya</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a security solution in key management and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for wireless sensor networks.

We propose Hint Key Distribution (HKD) for key management and Adaptive IDS for distributing activated IDS nodes and cooperative operation of these two protocols.   HKD protocol focuses on the challenges of energy, computation and security. It uses a hint message and key chain to consume less energy while self-generating key can secure the secret key. It is a proposed solution to key distribution in sensor networks.   Adaptive IDS uses threshold and voting algorithm to distribute IDS through the network. An elected node is activated IDS to monitor its network and neighbors. A threshold is used as a solution to reduce number of repeated activations of the same node. We attempt to distribute the energy use equally across the network.   In a cooperative protocol, HKD and Adaptive IDS exchange information in order to adjust to the current situation.

As workplaces adapt their practices to compete globally, demand for skilled and knowledgeable workers places pressure on institutional training providers such as TAFE to develop training programs that support the acquisition of higher order thinking skills in graduates. Using a competence based framework as a backdrop, the research centres on the notion of the place of Project Based Learning in a Training Package context. The research proposes that learning through projects is an effective means of integrating Training Package outcomes with an instructional model that engages learners in independent, flexible and reflective learning.    The research was conducted retrospectively from a case study of an AQF Level 6 Textile, Clothing and Footwear Training Package Program at RMIT University TAFE. An Action Research approach underpins the investigation, resulting in the profiling of teaching, learning and assessment as areas in need of further examination. These defining themes are explored in the context of the Project Based Learning model developed at RMIT, with consideration given to the potential for broader application. The discussion concludes with a theoretical review of the new understandings of pedagogy.    The study aims to establish that a constructive alignment exists between the behaviourist approach of Training Packages and the more constructivist theories behind Project Based Learning; rendering it a suitable instructional model that meets the needs of 21st century learners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Project Based Learning</field><field name="subject">Training Packages</field><field name="subject">Employability Skills</field><field name="subject">Competency Based Training</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="subject">Portfolio Assessment</field><field name="subject">VET</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">Innovative Practice</field><field name="subject">Action Research</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080729.165211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the Lithgow New Government Office Development; Using Best Practice to Deliver Sustainable Developments</field><field name="creator">Urizar, Mark</field><field name="description">Business practices have and will continue to greatly influence and determine the shape and viability of the built environment. Traditional practices have continued to use non renewable and polluting resources such as fossil fuels, and these are rapidly becoming unviable and unacceptable within the built environment. As an alternative to these traditional practices, concerned building practitioners are applying best practice initiatives in the-belief that these produce sustainable outcomes.    The research titled 'A study of the Lithgow New Government Office Development; Using Best Practice to Deliver Sustainable Developments' is based on the hypothesis that applying building industry's best practice initiatives can deliver sustainability within the built environment. This hypothesis assumes links between the applied practices, the outcome achieved and sustainability. This research tests this hypothesis with a single 'critical' case project; the recently constructed Lithgow Government Office Building (GOB) Development, and against a theoretical framework that defines sustainability.   The GOB Development is a best practice example procured by a long lived and socially responsible organisation, government organisation - the Department of Commerce. This organisation adopted and applied new government policies along with best practice initiatives to produce a new benchmark - an award wining, trend-setting, seemingly sustainable development. The industry successes of the GOB Development made this a suitable single case study, one that was most likely to fare better than any other development procured at that time and by other means.    The research conducted provides an insight and understanding into all the different factors during the procurement of the GOB project and highlights how these influenced the eventual built outcome and determined whether sustainability would be attained. This research assessment is seen as a crucial step in understanding the many limitations of best practice and thereby enabling the building industry's progression towards achieving sustainability within the built environment. The potential insight that can be gained from this research can enable the relationship between practice and theory to be better understood, and thereby provide the means to influence all future built outcomes. It is believed that such insight can encourage building practitioners and organisations to adopt and apply best practice initiatives as a means to achieve sustainability within the built environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Best Practice</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Developments</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Construction Industry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080730.114440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What's important to raters in judging work performance: Mapping individual priorities and management team differences</field><field name="creator">Muir, Errol William</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the application of personal construct psychology and the repertory grid to performance management in a technical consulting organisation. The research examines what is important for a manager in assessing work performance and how each manager's mental model for performance compares with his/her peers. Managers acting as raters are the critical link in the observation and assessment of performance and in the feedback process.  Rater observations and judgements are affected by their personal mental models regarding what is important. These views may or may not accord with those of their peers, resulting in inconsistency and unfair assessments, or with what the organisation's strategy demands.  Understanding rater views on what is important, and how well these align with strategy, is a key to ensure that the appraisal process supports, rather than hinders, both individual and organisational needs.      Each manager's personal constructs relating to appraisal were elicited through a repertory grid interview.  The elicited constructs were taken together and categorised to derive broad performance categories summarising the views of the entire management team.  Each individual's personal constructs were then allocated to the relevant common category to develop a view of how each manager related to the group's overall approach to appraisal.  A measure for the importance of each category in making performance judgments (importance score) was derived based on the correlation of the constructs in each category with an overall performance construct. A second measure of a manager's preparedness to discriminate between levels of performance was also derived (discriminant score) based on the variation in each manager's construct structure.  In keeping with the personal construct psychology approach, the process emphasizes the importance of discussion with the individual concerned to verify the sorting and ranking pro cess.  A ranking process to establish the overall management group priorities for judging performance (team mental models) was demonstrated and a charting process was developed to facilitate presentation and discussion of the results.       The research has demonstrated the strength of the repertory grid process as a means of getting at a rater's framework for thinking about appraisal and provides a way to identify possible voids or blind spots in a rater's approach.  Understanding the most important categories of performance used by raters provides an opportunity for management to determine whether these are likely to achieve the objectives of the company, and if necessary, to introduce and inculcate different approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance appraisal</field><field name="subject">repertory grid</field><field name="subject">personal construct psychology</field><field name="subject">mental models</field><field name="subject">performance management</field><field name="subject">schema</field><field name="subject">schemata</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080730.141212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tao of Communication Design Practice: manifesting implicit values through human-centred design</field><field name="creator">Akama, Yoko</field><field name="description">This research explores how human values and concerns are manifested and negotiated through the process of design.

A range of attribution approaches has been proposed in recent years, but none of these are particularly satisfactory; some of them are ad hoc and most have defects in terms of scalability, effectiveness, and computational cost.      Good test collections are critical for evaluation of authorship attribution (AA) techniques. However, there are no standard benchmarks available in this area; it is almost always the case that researchers have their own test collections. Furthermore, collections that have been explored in AA are usually small, and thus whether the existing approaches are reliable or scalable is unclear. We develop several AA collections that are substantially larger than those in literature; machine learning methods are used to establish the value of using such corpora in AA. The results, also used as baseline results in this thesis, show that the developed text collections can be used as standard benchmarks, and are able to clearly distinguish between different approaches.      One of the major contributions is that we propose use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, a measure of how different two distributions are, to identify authors based on elements of writing style. The results show that our approach is at least as effective as, if not always better than, the best existing attribution methods-that is, support vector machines-for two-class AA, and is superior for multi-class AA. Moreover our proposed method has much lower computational cost and is cheaper to train.       Style markers are the key elements of style analysis. We explore several approaches to tokenising documents to extract style markers, examining which marker type works the best. We also propose three systems that boost the AA performance by combining evidence from various marker types, motivated from the observation that there is no one type of marker that can satisfy all AA scenarios.      To address the scalability of AA, we propose the novel task of authorship search (AS), inspired by document search and intended for large document collections. Our results show that AS is reasonably effective to find documents by a particular author, even within a collection consisting of half a million documents. Beyond search, we also propose the AS-based method to identify authorship. Our method is substantially more scalable than any method published in prior AA research, in terms of the collection size and the number of candidate authors; the discrimination is scaled up to several hundred authors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Authorship attribution</field><field name="subject">authorship search</field><field name="subject">stylometric studies</field><field name="subject">style markers</field><field name="subject">language models</field><field name="subject">Kullback-Leibler divergence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080730.162501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Matter and Ghost: An Exploration of the Idea of the Sacred in Ordinary Things</field><field name="creator">Bradbeer, Honor</field><field name="description">The focus of this project is the exploration of notions of the sacred through the study of functional, unadorned forms and the processes by which I translate them into drawn images. My objective is to observe and represent what I see as visually essential to objects such as bowl, egg and rag. My intention is to engage aspects of archetypal simplicity, providing a visual starting-point for contemplation in the viewer.      Detached from specific liturgical contexts, the notion of 'sacredness' is not anchored by traditional icons. The logic behind the austerity of my 'generic' subject matter is to make a visual connection to the otherwise formless concept of a primal imprint of human consciousness, to anchor my exploration of the sacred.      I aim to discover a position between figuration and abstraction that can communicate what I see as elemental to the subject of each drawing, concentrating the arena for contemplation within the bounds of the form depicted.

The environment was designed to accommodate individual learning styles while students progressed through a computer programming course.      Despite the benefits of individualised instruction and a growing worldwide e-learning market, there is a paucity of guidance on how to effectively accommodate learning styles in an online environment. Several existing learning-style adaptive environments base their behaviour on an initial assessment of the learner's profile, which is then assumed to remain stable. Consequently, these environments rarely offer the learner choices between different versions of content. However, these choices could cater for flexible learning styles, promote cognitive flexibility, and increase learner control.      The first research question underlying the project asked how learning styles could be accommodated in an adaptive e-learning environment. The second question asked whether a dynamically adaptive environment that provides the learner with a choice of media experiences is more beneficial than a statically adapted environment.      To answer these questions, an adaptive e-learning environment named iWeaver was created and experimentally evaluated. iWeaver was based on an introductory course in Java programming and offered learning content as style-specific media experiences, assisted by additional learning tools. These experiences and tools were based on the perceptual and information processing dimension of an adapted version of the Dunn and Dunn learning styles model.      An experimental evaluation of iWeaver was conducted with 63 multimedia students. The analysis investigated the effect of having a choice of multiple media experiences (compared to having just one static media experience) on learning gain, enjoyment, perceived progress, and motivation. In addition to these quantitative measurements, learners provided qualitative feedback at the end of each lesson.      Data from 27 participants were sufficiently complete to be analysed. For the data analysis, participants were divided into two groups of high and low interest in programming and Java, then into two groups of high and low experience with computers and the Internet. Both group comparisons revealed statistically significant differences for the effect of choice. Having a choice of media experiences proved beneficial for learners with low experience but detrimental for learners with high experience or interest. These findings suggest that the effect of choice appears to be strongly influenced by the learner's background. It is hypothesised that encouraging a more active learner role in educational systems would expand the positive influence of choice to a wider range of learners.      The study has contributed some weight to the argument that for certain groups of learners, it is more beneficial to view learning style as a flexible, rather than a stable construct. As a practical implication, it seems advisable to collect data on prior experience, interest, and the initial learning style distribution of the target audience before developing environments comparable to iWeaver.

It employs traditional event study approaches to identify and measure stock market reactions to terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, 2001, and subsequent terrorist attacks in Madrid, London and Bali.  Three studies are presented.  The first study investigates the impact of September 11 on the tenant firms within the World Trade Centre.  The second study investigates industry effects following the Madrid and London bombings.  The third study undertakes a sensitivity analysis to different event study techniques over the various terrorist attacks.      The results from the three studies suggest that equity markets can remain efficient in the wake of terrorist events.  Terrorist events can trigger large abnormal movement in both equity prices and volume traded.  These price and volume effects are influenced by industry effects.  Terrorism has a differential impact on stock markets and industry portfolios within stock markets.  The detailed analysis presented in this thesis can be used to exploit that industry effect and can be employed to guide diversification strategies that could minimize terrorist risk through industry diversification.        The thesis has also evaluated alternative event study methods and produced a critical analysis of event study methodology.  It shows clearly that methodological choices can and do significantly influence results.  The thesis contributes to eliminating some uncertainty about the markets response to terrorist events, and identifies opportunities for reducing terrorist risk in stock markets.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Terrorism</field><field name="subject">Stock Markets</field><field name="subject">Event Study.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080731.102528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Putting the Community in the Centre: Towards Effective Village-Based Planning and Development in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Catford, Andrew Robert</field><field name="description">In addition to successful economic reforms, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV) is also in the process of implementing reforms in the areas of civil society, decentralisation and grassroots democracy, within what is generally considered a strong state environment. Relevant research argues that uninhibited democracy, decentralisation and civil society are important elements in achieving what has been popularly termed community 'participation' by development practitioners.       This process was particularly assisted by the release of the grassroots democracy decree of 1998 and its subsequent update in 2003 that set out the details of what Vietnam required from the village and commune levels as part of the reform process. Interestingly, it is also these two levels that form the dividing line between government and community in Vietnam. Although there have been several studies investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the implementation of the grassroots democracy decree and other related policies, village-based planning and development programs, which are a development approach piloted by several non-government organisations (NGOs) and donors to address these issues, have not been comprehensively evaluated. These programs, which are generally long-term, area-based, holistic and integrated, have frequently been observed to deliver many of the relevant elements within the larger notions of democracy, decentralisation, civil society and participation.      The research explores the effectiveness of village-based planning and development approaches within the Vietnamese context using both quality and quantity criteria to assess elements of program effectiveness, focussing primarily on community level perspectives. Four projects of a selected international non-government organisation (INGO), were used as a detailed case study utilising a combination of qualitative focus groups and interviews, complimented by two quantitative household interviews. These community opinions were triangulated against the opinion of other key stakeholders including government, bilateral and multilateral aid donors, as well as Vietnamese and International NGOs involved in such approaches.       The research highlights that with careful attention, village-based planning and development approaches do have the ability to more effectively allow the community to be put back into the 'centre of development' in Vietnam, rather than being passive recipients or marginalised by the development process. A set of seven key elements that contribute to more effective village-based planning and development approaches in Vietnam has been outlined in this thesis. It is hoped that these key elements might be further utilised by donor, NGO and government agencies to support the appropriate replication and up-scaling of the approaches to enable development needs and poverty to be more effectively reduced in Vietnam      However, the approaches are not without their challenges, in particular in terms of achieving integrated planning from village to national level, being flexible enough for the variety of ethnic minority and geographical areas, effectively involving a broad and appropriate range of individuals and organised civil society groups and, perhaps most importantly, taking the approaches beyond the current few pilot programs to a national scale that forms a more integral part of the government's overall poverty reduction strategy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Village</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="subject">Civil Society</field><field name="subject">Decentralization</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080731.114440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fostering technologies for sustainability: Improving Strategic Niche Management as a guide for action using a case study of wind power in Australia</field><field name="creator">Healey, Gerard Patrick</field><field name="description">Society is making increasing efforts to become more sustainable by fostering new technologies such as renewable energy. Often, there are significant challenges to introducing new technologies because existing infrastructure, institutions, social groupings, and behaviours have co-evolved with and consequently support incumbent technologies - a condition known as lock-in.      To support efforts to introduce new technologies, researchers have developed conceptual frameworks that aim to increase our understanding of socio-technical change. One promising framework is Strategic Niche Management (SNM); however despite its strength as an ex post analytical tool, SNM has yet to be used to guide experiments with new technologies.      This thesis aims to make SNM more usable for those introducing new technologies by responding to four weaknesses identified in existing literature: a weak link between the conceptual framework and action, the vague role of actors, an inadequate appreciation of issues of consensus and limits of influence, and an inadequate appreciation of the challenges that actors may face. This is achieved by identifying promising insights and testing them on a case study of wind power in Australia.      The literature review identifies dynamics that have been linked to positive feedbacks in the development of new technologies and socio-technical change. These are: stimulating demand, increasing use, learning and articulation, increasing functionality, decreasing costs, decreasing uncertainty, embedding and alignment, increasing legitimacy, attracting actors, and strengthening expectations and visions. These dynamics can be used to provide a better link between theory and action. The review also identifies particular actor roles - such as niche manager, macro actor, prime mover, and dedicated network builder - and actions that actors in these roles may take. These roles and actions are linked to the dynamics. Also reviewed are issues related to consensus and limits of influence; a particularly useful concept in this regard is resource interdependency. Finally, the review identifies challenges to encouraging the dynamics aimed at helping actors to anticipate problems in the introduction of new technologies. T he relevance of this approach and applicability of these insights are tested with a case study of wind power in Australia.      The case study explains changes related to grid-connected wind power in Australia between about 1997 and 2007. There was significant socio-technical change: for example, installed grid-connected wind farm capacity grew from about 1 MW to almost 900 MW, an industry and industry association formed, there were unprecedented changes in energy policy, new high-level actor groups formed to oversee the grid-integration of wind power, Governments amended planning schemes, and public opinion was increasingly articulated.      The dynamics identified in the literature review were all relevant to wind power. The study provides examples of the actors that can encourage these dynamics and how they might do so. Most challenges identified in the literature review were relevant to wind power and possible strategies for managing them were identified. Also revealed were challenges in transitional strategies, legitimacy of the technology and consensus. These findings are discussed in detail. These findings are intended to help actors foster technologies for sustainability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wind power</field><field name="subject">socio-technical change</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">niche</field><field name="subject">regime</field><field name="subject">technological change</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080731.141738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Hartmann Screen Test for Measurement of Stress during Thin Film Deposition</field><field name="creator">Forouzandeh, Farhad</field><field name="description">The Hartmann screen test (HST) is a well-known technique that has been used for many years in optical metrology.  This thesis describes how the technique has been adapted to create a system for continuous in situ monitoring of the internal stress in thin films during plasma deposition.        Stress is almost always present in thin films.  Stress can affect the physical properties of film, and also influence phenomena which are important in the technology of thin film manufacture such as adhesion and crystallographic defects.  For these reasons, it is very important to control and manage the film stress during manufacture of devices based on thin films.      The commonest way to infer stress is to measure the change in substrate curvature that it produces.  This is often done by comparison of substrate curvatures before and after deposition with surface profilometry, or interferometry.  However, these methods are unsuitable for implementing during film deposition in the vacuum chamber.        A novel method for measuring changes in curvature of the thin film substrate in situ has been developed, making use of the HST.  An expanded laser beam is passed through a screen containing a number of small apertures, which breaks it up into several rays.  After reflecting from the surface of the thin film wafer, the rays are received on an array detector as a spot pattern.  Image processing is performed on the recorded spot images to determine the positions of spots accurately.  Spot centre positions are recorded at start of deposition as a reference, then their displacement is tracked with time during deposition.  The spot deflections are fitted to a theoretical model, in which the change in sample profile is described by a second-order surface.  The principal axes of curvature of this surface and their orientation are obtained by a least-squares fitting procedure.  From this, the thin film stress can be inferred and monitored in real time.      Equipment using this technique has been designed and developed in prototype form for eventual use in the RMIT cathodic arc deposition facility.  First experiments with a classic Hartmann screen configuration proved that the technique gave good results, but precision was limited by diffraction and interference effects in the recorded image which made determination of spot centres more difficult.  A modified configuration was developed, in which a camera is focused on the Hartmann screen, giving much sharper spot patterns and improved resolution.        Tests on the prototype system and comparison with other techniques have shown that it is possible to determine changes in sample curvature with a precision of approximately 0.01 m-1.  This corresponds to stress changes of around 0.5 GPa for typical wafer and film thicknesses used in practice.      The Hartmann screen test is straightforward to use and to interpret.  Image processing and analysis of the recorded spot patterns can be automated and performed continuously in real time during thin film deposition.  The system promises to be very useful for monitoring stress and thus controlling the deposition process for improved quality of thin film manufacture.</field><field name="date">30/6/2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">Hartmann test</field><field name="subject">curvature</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">plasma deposition</field><field name="subject">optical metrology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080731.144206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Victorian Chinese Medicine Workforce and Practitioner Capability</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Wenyu</field><field name="description">Chinese medicine (CM) as a popular form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been increasingly used in the Western world over the last three decades. While the importance of original research on quality, safety and efficacy of CM therapies is well argued and supported, there has been a general negligence of the role of education in protecting public safety, promoting CM as a form of evidence-based healthcare and improving the quality of clinical CM services. This study aimed to determine the essential practitioner capabilities to ensure the safe, competent and contemporary Chinese medicine clinical practice in complex healthcare systems such that of Australia.       There are two major studies in this thesis: the workforce study and the capability postal survey. For the workforce study, a specific instrument with a coding system was developed and approved by the Chinese Medicine Registration Board of Victoria (CMRBVic) prior to the commencement of the data collection based on registration forms submitted by all practitioners registered with CMRBVic during the transitional (also known as grand-parenting) period. Findings from the workforce study provide comprehensive data on the current state of the Victorian CM workforce concerning their educational background, clinical experience and their current practice of CM.      Findings of the capability postal survey represent a major step in the development of a capability-based curriculum that meets the needs of the Chinese medicine workforce. The findings of this study provide the basis for developing specific continuing professional educational programs that address knowledge and skill gaps such as communication, referral, research training and for some practitioners, basic biomedical sciences.       In conclusion, this study, for the first time, provided the comprehensive data on the state of the Victorian CM workforce and CM practitioners' views on desired practitioner capabilities. A number of continuing professional education needs were identified and the successful implementation of these programs will contribute to the safe and competent CM practice and thus protect the public safety.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese medicine</field><field name="subject">workforce</field><field name="subject">practitioner capability</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080801.121456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Host Community Attitudes towards Tourism and Resident-Tourist Interaction: A Socio-Behavioural Study of Melbourne's Urban-Rural Fringe</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jiaying</field><field name="description">The fast development of the tourism industry has created both positive and negative impacts on host communities. Reacting to these impacts, host residents hold various attitudes towards tourism and tourists. It has come to common agreement that a supportive host community plays a vital role in the successful and long-term development of community tourism.      In order to explain the antecedents of community attitudes towards tourism, researchers have investigated the topic from both the extrinsic perspective (such as stage-based models) and the intrinsic perspective (such as the Social Exchange Theory). Nevertheless, there are still several important research gaps and deficiencies within the existing literature. First, the influence of psychological factors (personality) on attitudes towards tourism is somewhat neglected. Second, when examining the relationship between community attitudes towards tourism and the influential factors, the majority of previous studies do not distinguish the orthogonal dimensions of attitudes (such as positive dimension and negative dimension). Third, the existing literature has not addressed the issue of whether specific attitudes towards tourism will lead to a corresponding behaviour when interacting with tourists, and what other factors are determinant in host-guest interactive behaviour.      Aiming to address such research gaps and deficiencies, this study has a major objective of developing a theoretical model (encompassing attitude element) to understand the antecedents of host-guest interaction. A quantitative approach was employed for the entire project. A self-administrated questionnaire survey was used to collect primary data. A total of 878 useful questionnaires were returned for analyses. Stratification sampling methods were utilized in communities where population database was accessible, while random sampling methods were used in other communities.       The findings from this study confirmed the two major hypotheses in terms of community attitudes towards tourism. First, there was a significant relationship between an individual's personality and his/her attitudes towards tourism. Residents being high on Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness traits and low on the Neuroticism trait tended to be more positive towards tourism than their counterparts. Second, while some factors were found to be influential on both positive and negative dimensions of attitudes towards tourism, others only demonstrated influences on one dimension.       The Resident-Tourist Interaction Model developed in this study provided a comprehensive theoretical framework in modelling and predicting host residents' interactive behaviour towards tourists. Drawing on the evaluation results of three leading behavioural theories belonging to the school of cognition, the Model identified attitudinal, volitional, social, motivating and habitual factors for the prediction of resident-tourist interactive behaviour. Motivating factor (intention) was the critical and immediate element for action, which, in turn, was best predicted by subjective norms. External factors (gender, age and personality traits) only moderated the predictive power of the Model by less than two percent. The Model was valid and reliable for the current data.      The present study advanced resident-tourist interactive behavioural study by establishing a sound theoretical framework. It also consolidated the body of knowledge in understanding community attitudes towards tourism. Findings from this study have significant practical implications for community tourism planning and management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community attitudes</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">host-guest interaction</field><field name="subject">TRA</field><field name="subject">TPB</field><field name="subject">TIB</field><field name="subject">urban fringe</field><field name="subject">Five factor model</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">social exchange theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080801.144715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and Community Development in India: Examining the Paradoxes of Everyday Practice</field><field name="creator">Patianayak, Supriya</field><field name="description">My experience as a development aid worker has brought to the fore the incongruence between the rhetoric and practice of community development in India, more so in relation to women.  Historically, the practice of community development in India has also been imposed and could be considered as an 'imperialist' relic of the colonial rule.  This has been traced through an extensive literature review and discourse analysis of the five year plan and other related documents.      The research aimed to uncover the manner in which rural Indian women engaged with structures and processes of community development and to explore what benefits or otherwise accrued to them.  It further sought to explore the reasons for the failure of a particular program as envisaged by local women.  The thesis used the framework of structuration, everyday life and community development theories (Giddens, Lefevbre, de Certeau, Ife) and an ethnographic methodological approach.  One rural community of 52 households, in the state of Orissa (India) was the subject of study and in-depth interviews were conducted with three key informants.      Participant observation was the cornerstone of this research in order to gain an in-depth view of the everyday lives of women, with the researcher spending seven months in the community.  Themes were developed around the community development program (Mahila Mandals) and the key informants were interviewed regarding the same, its formation, structure, processes, the reasons for its initial success and subsequent failure and finally women's agency in engaging with various aspects of the program.      The findings showed that this program would not have developed unless it had been driven from the top; women had no say in the structures and processes, and while it was successful initially for instrumental reasons, not taking into account women's agency was the reason for its downfall.  Despite these lessons, it is recognised that the practice of community development continues to remain top-down.  Till date, international aid agencies, government's (national, state and local), and/or INGOs/ NGOs that determine the needs of the communities and the approaches to addressing and evaluating them.       Conclusions include a policy discussion on the attempt by international agencies, especially DFID, and governments (of India and Orissa) to address gender issues in their existing and new programs taking into account women's agency as constructed in their everyday lives.  There is an agreement with the international, national and local debates that gender issues have to be addressed with great urgency in view of the changing roles of women.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">india</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080801.161211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strongly Perturbed Harmonic Oscillator</field><field name="creator">Peidaee, Pantea</field><field name="description">The limits of current micro-scale technology is approaching rapidly. As the technology is going toward nano-scale devices, physical phenomena involved are fundamentally different from micro-scale ones [1], [2]. Principles in classical physics are no longer   powerful enough to explicate the phenomena involved in nano-scale devices. At this stage, quantum mechanic sheds some light on those topics which cannot be described by classical physics. The primary focus of this research work is the development of an analysis technique for understanding the behavior of strongly perturbed harmonic oscillators.   Developing ``auxiliary'' boundary value problems we solve monomially perturbed harmonic oscillators. Thereby, we assume monomial terms of arbitrary degree and any finite coefficient desired. The corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be utilized   to solve more complex anharmonic oscillators with non polynomial anharmonicity or numerically defined anharmonicity.   A large number of numerical calculations demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of our technique. Particular attention has been paid to the details as have implemented the underlying formula. We have developed iterative expressions for the involved integrals and the introduced ``Universal Functions.'' The latter are applications and   adaptations of a concept which was developed in 1990's to accelerate computations in the Boundary Element Method.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">harmonic oscillators</field><field name="subject">strongly peturbed</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080804.094824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Under the Bitumen the River - Translating the Imagination</field><field name="creator">Peacock, Mary</field><field name="description">The project was informed by non-rational modes of perception  which explored the matrix of dream, imagination, my body and the viewer.

Connection to socio-cultural 'meaning' and relevance arguably occurs primarily via the assumed divinity or universality of these systems. In the contemporary architectural world, where explicitly held beliefs in fundamental, geometrically defined principles or values have dissipated, guiding principles of composition appear to be obsolete. This seems particularly true in relation to work that highlights process - or change, responsiveness, interactivity and adaptability - since this implies that the composition remains in flux and unable to be grounded in the composition of form. While processually inflected architecture (referred to here as 'processual architecture'), has been an active field since at least the 1960s, it has been significantly developed since design experiments involving digital computation intensified in t he 1990s. For this field of work,  both highly celebrated and criticised as superficial or unethical, any connection to 'meaning' or value that might be offered by principles of composition would appear especially lost.       This thesis reviews, counterpoises and reorients these assumptions, arguing a case for the value of processual architectural that has not been previously articulated. After the last 10 to 15 years of digital experimentation, it is clear that digital technology in itself is not the primary issue, but simply part of a complex equation. The thesis articulates this 'equation' through the model of emergence, which has been used in the field with increasing prominence in recent years. Through both practice-based research and theoretical development, a processually inflected theory of composition is proposed. This offers pathways through which the potential of processual architecture might be productively developed, aiming to open this field of work into a deeper engagement with pressing contemporary socio-political issues.       The thesis demonstrates how the cultivation of particular modes of attention and engagement, found to hold an implicit but nevertheless amplified significance within processual architecture, make it possible to develop an embodied awareness pertaining to an 'ethico-aesthetic know-how'. This know-how is acquired and matured through attention to the affective dimensions that arise through design activity. The thesis highlight aspects of design process and products that are routinely suppressed in architectural discourse, generating new insights into the importance of affect for design process, design products and the relations between them. The ethical dimensions of such an approach become especially poignant through the explicit connection made between design activity and the practices of everyday life. Relationships between architecture and the social become re-energised, in a radically alternative manner to the social agendas of modernism or the more literary critiques of post-modernism.       Through detailed discussions of the specific, local conditions with a series of  design projects I have undertaken, I argue how and why close attention to the affective dimensions of design process offers new and productive ways to approach research through design practice. This offers a response to the calls for new 'post-critical' forms of research through empowering both sides of a previously held divide: theory and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital architecture</field><field name="subject">installation art</field><field name="subject">design process</field><field name="subject">aesthetics</field><field name="subject">affect</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">emergence</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="subject">diagramming</field><field name="subject">Greg Lynn</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080804.161628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does the Diocese of Aitape provide empowerment opportunities for women? An assessment based upon the views of women of the Diocese.</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, John Stephen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine the effect that the Catholic Diocese of Aitape in the Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea, and by implication, the Catholic Church, has had on the lives of women, as assessed by women of the Diocese themselves. Much research has been done into how women can be, and/or become, empowered through development project approaches and through the agency of development agencies and people. Many such projects have been relatively short lived and have also been sector specific. If such projects are seen to have an impact upon the lives of women, a long standing institution such as the Catholic Diocese of Aitape which has such a great influence on the lives of the people living within the Diocese could also be expected to have an impact upon the lives of women.         Women reflecting upon their own lives and the lives of their mothers and grandmothers and what differences there are and how the Diocese/Church has contributed to these changes has provided the data for analysis within this thesis. Based upon the reflections of women, selected as being representative of the women of the Diocese, the Diocese and the Catholic Church have indeed contributed to a degree of empowerment for women that these women may not have otherwise achieved within contemporary Papua New Guinea society. The various teaching, policies and practices of the Diocese and the Church have enabled a greater freedom of association, movement and opportunity for women to individually and collectively become empowered to some degree.         The patriarchal nature of the Church hierarchy and the interaction between the Church and the Diocese however remains a barrier to true gender equality across all aspects of the Diocese and Church. While this remains so, increasing localisation of the Church within Melanesian society may well mean that gains made by women through the agency of the Catholic Diocese of Aitape, need to be defended from erosion by a more Melanesian version of that same Diocese.

Limited olfactory reports on 7-membered benzodioxepine analogues with modification influenced by functionality, polarity, and ring size, prompted us to construct a range of aromatic and C-3 substituted structures for olfactory evaluation.  Incorporation of a diverse range of functionality contributes valuable information on the molecular aspects that determine the archetypal marine character of Calone 1951&#174;.  Here we present the preparation of Calone 1951&#174; analogues including spectroscopic and olfactory details to contribute to the sparse marine fragrance arena.  In these studies pertaining to the odour properties of benzodioxepinone systems, we considered the modification of substitution and functionality on the aromatic ring in the context of qua litative olfactory analysis.        Application of the patented Williamson and Dieckmann reaction pathways resulted in construction of the benzodioxepinone molecule.  Preparation of aryl-substituted benzodioxepinones required introduction of an alternate broadly applicable synthetic pathway due to the diverse nature of the introduced substituents.  Limitations of the patented approach led to incorporation of a simple but novel methodology applied to the same range of substituted catechol reagents for synthesis of the benzodioxepinone skeleton and an overview of comparable yields.  Single-step mechanisms were also successfully applied to contribute to the repertoire of benzodioxepin(on)e structures prepared for olfactory analysis.      Semi-empirical models of the synthesised data set were generated and evaluated in light of previous research undertaken by Archer and Claret and related to the olfactory characteristics of each compound.  Evaluation of the models with corresponding olfactory information revealed that functionality and ring size contribute significantly to the conformation adopted by the benzodioxepinone species and therefore the olfactory character of the molecule.        It is evident from our observations that aromatic ring substitution and functional alteration of the cyclic ketone modifies the perceived odour of Calone 1951&#174;.  Structural modification overall led to a decrease in odour potency.  The presence of the aromatic methyl substituent in Calone 1951&#174; reinforces, but is not critical for, the marine tonality.  Modification of the ketone of Calone 1951&#174; led to significant deviation in character from the prototypical marine odour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calone 1951&#174;</field><field name="subject">benzodioxepinone</field><field name="subject">structure-odour-relationships (SORs)</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">odourants</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080805.102446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus in the cardiovascular responses to elevations in body temperature.</field><field name="creator">Cham, Joo Lee</field><field name="description">The hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is known to be a major integrative region within the forebrain. It is composed of functionally different subgroups of neurons, including the parvocellular neurons that project to important autonomic targets in the brainstem e.g. the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and the intermediolateral cell column (IML) of the spinal cord, where the sympathetic preganglionic motor-neurons are located. These regions are critical in cardiovascular regulation; hence, these projections are likely to mediate the effects of the PVN on sympathetic nerve activity and hence may contribute to the cardiovascular changes induced by physiological stimuli such as elevations in body temperature.       The neurotransmitter such as nitric oxide (NO) is important in cardiovascular regulation and it is now emerging as a major focus of investigation in thermoregulation. One of the most striking accumulations of NO containing-neurons is in the PVN where it appears to be playing an important role in cardiovascular regulation and body fluid homeostasis.       The results of the work show;       1.	That spinally-projecting and nitrergic neurons in the PVN may contribute to the central pathways activated by exposure to a hot environment.      2.	Suggests that nitrergic neurons and spinally- projecting neurons in the brainstem may make a small contribution to the central pathways mediating the reflex responses initiated by hyperthermia.      3.	The present study also illustrates that these PVN neurons projecting to the RVLM may make a smaller contribution than the spinal-projecting neurons in the PVN to the cardiovascular responses initiated by heat.      4.	The results of my studies showed that the microinjection of muscimol to inhibit the neuronal activity in the PVN abolished the reflex decrease in renal blood flow following an elevation of core body temperature. In addition, this effect was specific to the PVN, since microinjections of muscimol into areas outside the PVN were not effective. These findings demonstrate that the PVN is critical for this reflex cardiovascular response initiated by hyperthermia.        In conclusion, PVN is critical for the reflex decrease in renal blood flow during elevations in core body temperature. We hypothesise that projections from the PVN to the spinal cord and the RVLM contribute to the reflex cardiovascular responses. Additionally, nitrergic neurons in the PVN may contribute but the physiological role of those neurons in the reflex responses elicited by hyperthermia needs to be investigated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Paraventricular nucleus</field><field name="subject">hyperthermia</field><field name="subject">sympathetic</field><field name="subject">renal blood flow</field><field name="subject">intermediolateral cell column of spinal cord</field><field name="subject">rostral ventrolateral medulla</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080805.114529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterologous expression of cellulase enzymes in transplastidic Nicotiana tabacum cv.

Some accomplishments have been made in this area using nuclear genetic transformation (Abdeev et al., 2003; Abdeev et al., 2004; Austin-Phillips et al., 1999; Biswas et al., 2006; Dai et al., 2000a,b; Dai et al., 2005; Jin et al., 2003; Kawazu et al., 1999; Sakka et al., 2000; Ziegelhoffer et al., 1999; Ziegelhoffer et al., 2001; Ziegler et al., 2000), but more research is required to bring the levels of cellulase enzyme expression in plants to levels that will make the process economically competitive.   	   Chloroplasts of N. tabacum were selected as a target for transformation for high level expression due to their extremely high rates of transcription and translation. These were transformed with two genes, the e1 gene from A. cellulolyticus, and the cbh1 gene from T. reesei. Further aims included the investigation of the effects of using different promoters, and the novel use of both nuclear and chloroplast-based expression in a single plant, on the level of protein production in the heterologous host.      Heterologous expression of the cbh1 gene was not successful. This is thought to be due to toxicity of the protein in a prokaryotic environment.  Future studies should focus on trying to avoid this toxicity by targeting of the chloroplast-expressed enzyme to specific tissues, such as the thylakoid membrane, for containment, creating a codon-optimised synthetic gene that better mimics the codon usage of the plant to be used for expression, or placing the expression under a reactive cascade that is only activated upon exposure to an external trigger.       Heterologous expression of the full length gene for E1 from A. cellulolyticus was successful. Chloroplast homology vectors under the constitutive promoter Prrn, and the inducible promoter T7, were constructed and these were used to successfully transform N. tabacum cv. Petit Havana chloroplasts. Stable transgenic plants were produced and evaluated by a variety of means, with the heterologously expressed enzyme showing activity against the soluble substrate analogue MUC of up to 3122 &#177; 466 pmol 4-MU/mg TSP/min and an E1 accumulation level of up to 0.35% &#177; 0.06 of the total soluble protein.       Lastly, chloroplast transformation was combined with nuclear transformation to create novel dual-transgenic plants simultaneously expressing E1 from both the nuclear and chloroplast genomes. The combination of these technologies was very successful, with the heterologously expressed enzyme showing activity against the soluble substrate analogue MUC of up to 35706 &#177; 955 pmol 4-MU/mg TSP/min and an E1 accumulation level of up to 4.78% &#177; 0.13 of the total soluble protein, and provides a new approach for increasing the accumulation levels of plant-produced cellulase enzymes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transgenic tobacco</field><field name="subject">chloroplast expression</field><field name="subject">cellulase</field><field name="subject">E1 endoglucanase</field><field name="subject">CBH1 exoglucanase</field><field name="subject">Acidothermus cellulolyticus</field><field name="subject">Trichoderma reesei</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080805.120923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy Balanced Sensor Node Organisation For Maximising Network Lifetime</field><field name="creator">Sakib, Kazi Muheymin-Us</field><field name="description">Recent advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and low-power short-range radios have enabled rapid development of wireless sensor networks. Future sensor networks are anticipated to include hundreds or thousands of these devices in many applications, such as capturing multimedia content for surveillance, structural health monitoring, tracking of accidental chemical leaks, machine failures, earthquakes and intrusion detection.       With the increase of sensor applications, a number of challenging problems related to the network protocol design has emerged - the most important ones relating to energy efficiency and lifetime maximisation. Techniques devised for sensor networks should deal with a large number of sensors distributed in the field. Wireless sensor nodes are deployed with limited energy reserves, so the networks should operate with minimum energy overhead. In fact, the network should take into account not only individual node's energy efficiency but also consider the global picture, because surviving nodes' energy reserves in a failed network are wasted energy.      This thesis examines a node organisation technique to deal with the above challenges. The focus is on improving network lifetime via organising the nodes in a distributed and energy efficient manner. The main goal is lowering wasted energy via energy balancing and exploiting node redundancy in case of node failure.       In particular, this thesis proposes Energy Balanced Clustering (EBC) method for node self-organisation where network tasks (such as data aggregation and data forwarding) are shifted to high-energy neighbours to reduce the energy consumption of low energy nodes. After showing how to extend network lifetime by energy balanced node organisation, the effect of redundant node deployments on network lifetime is addressed. Redundant nodes consume energy by performing unnecessary tasks so a method called Self-Calculated Redundancy Check (SCRC) is proposed to deactivate redundant nodes. A deactivated redundant node can be used as a replacement for a failed node. The Asynchronous Failed Sensor node Detection (AFSD) proposed in this thesis uses the data packets exchanged between neighbours to identify failed neighbours. To restore coverage for network holes caused by failed nodes, policies are given for re-activating redundant nodes.      Detailed analytical analysis and simulation of the proposed methods demonstrate that by taking into account energy balancing, eliminating redundant tasks and replacing failed nodes sensor network lifetime can significantly be improved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor Networks</field><field name="subject">Energy balancing</field><field name="subject">Self-organisation</field><field name="subject">Node Redundancy</field><field name="subject">Failed nodes</field><field name="subject">Node replacement policy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080805.135709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experiences of Men whose Partners have been Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Immediately after Childbirth.</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Janine</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT      Naturalistic Inquiry was used to explore, describe and discover the experiences and perceptions of men whose partners have been admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) immediately after childbirth.

Although the need for cross-cultural leadership effectiveness presents a major challenge to Australian businesses operating in China, most extant studies emphasize cultural dimensions and cultural influences on expatriate leadership effectiveness. In contrast, this study investigates the importance and implementation of transformational leadership (TL), emotional intelligence (EQ) and cultural intelligence (CQ) as key components of cross-cultural leadership capabilities within the context of Australian-Chinese cultural differences. Specifically, it answers one overarching question: What key factors contribute significantly to cross-cultural leadership effectiveness in Australian businesses operating in China?        Following an interpretivist research philosophy, this inductive study employed qualitative individual and focus group interviews with a final sample of 32 expatriate managers and 19 local Chinese managers working in 30 Australian organizations. The individual participants were top- and middle-level executives of Australian businesses operating in China in different industry sectors, including minerals and energy, manufacturing, consulting, building and construction, banking, legal services and education. Participants based their responses on their own experiences and observations. These perspectives were supplemented with equally important input from the focus group interviewees, who were Chinese local managers that work closely with the expatriates.       Based upon the findings of the study, the researcher developed a holistic pragmatic heuristic model of cross-cultural leadership effectiveness for Australian businesses operating in China, which emphasizes the developmental process underlying the emergence of effective expatriate leadership. This model defined and categorized three sets of cognitive, attitudinal and behavioural characteristics of effective cross-cultural leaders: personal (intrapersonal) competencies, social (interpersonal) competencies and cross-cultural competencies. Because the model is pragmatic as well as heuristic, its framework provides practitioners (e.g. Western and especially Australian expatriate leaders) with an informed understanding of the complexity of cross-cultural leadership issues in China, the importance of having theoretical knowledge on this topic, and the need to be flexible and pragmatic in applying this knowledge in daily practice. Thus, the model offers Australian firms currently investing or intending to invest in  China a specific strategy to assist expatriate selection and leadership development in that the competencies it contains can be used to recruit and develop suitable candidates and training criteria. Likewise, the model provides business coaches or business consultants serving Western organizations in China a comprehensive fundamental framework for developing competent global leaders. Hence, future research should concentrate on developing and validating cross-cultural leadership effectiveness in China model using diverse approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotional Intelligence (EQ)</field><field name="subject">Cultural Intelligence (CQ)</field><field name="subject">Transformational Leadership (TL)</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural Leadership</field><field name="subject">Expatriate</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080805.161224</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The isolation and characterisation of starches from legume grains and their application in food formulations</field><field name="creator">Lee, Horng Jye</field><field name="description">As a major group of agricultural commodities, legume grains are widely grown and consumed globally, but are often utilised in the whole form. With increasing evidence of nutritional benefits, these grains are potentially sources of novel ingredients including starches. Accordingly the objective of this study has been to investigate legume starches, particularly their isolation, characterisation and incorporation into selected food products. Using chickpea, faba bean, lentil and mung bean, extraction procedures for the practical isolation of legume starches have been evaluated. A relatively simple method has been established, involving grain cracking, steeping in a mildly alkaline solution, followed by washing, double blending, double sieving and sedimentation. The starches collected for the four legumes were oven dried and the recoveries ranged between 29 and 38%.      Compositional analyses confirming that the isolation procedure gave relatively pure starches and scanning electron microscopy showed that the granules were typically ellipsoidal. Laser particle size analysis showed mono-modal distributions with mean diameters between 19.6 and 23.9&#181;m. X-ray diffractograms of legume starches were of the typical C-type, with variations in the intensities and peak distribution indicating some differences in the crystallinity of the starches. Suitable conditions for the measurement of starch gelatinisation characteristics by differential scanning calorimetry were investigated. When optimised conditions were applied, the temperature of gelatinisation ranged from 58.9 for lentil to 65.7 &#176;C for mung bean with corresponding enthalpy values of 9.2 and 5.7 Jg-1. Hot-stage optical microscopy confirmed gelatinisation patterns. The starch pastes demonstrated opalescence with some variation in the degree of clarity. The pasting and viscosity properties measured by the Rapid Visco-Analyser  showed some variation in pasting temperatures and considerable differences in peak readings with faba bean starch having lowest and mung bean the highest with values of 307 and 676 RVA units, respectively.      In order to study the incorporation of the legume starches, two Asian food products having starch as an ingredient, were selected and adapted as model foods. In this context, vermicelli represented a savoury product and coconut cake a sweet product. Vermicelli and coconut cake samples that incorporated chickpea starch were both preferred by most of the panellists over those containing the other legume starches.      The overall conclusions are that the starch extraction method adapted in this investigation was a practical approach, producing relatively pure, white starches. The characteristics of the four legume starches showed many similarities, but there were some variations in the properties, indicating that there may be different applications for their incorporation into food formulations. Sensory evaluations confirmed the usefulness of the starches as food ingredients that provide attractive mouthfeel and textural characteristics. Therefore legume starches offer potential as novel food ingredients warranting further evaluation and larger scale feasibility studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Starch</field><field name="subject">chickpea</field><field name="subject">differential scanning calorimetry</field><field name="subject">faba bean</field><field name="subject">isolation</field><field name="subject">granules</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="subject">lentil</field><field name="subject">mung bean pulses</field><field name="subject">pasting</field><field name="subject">sensory evaluation</field><field name="subject">X-ray diffraction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080806.123415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FPGA Implementation of Short Word-Length Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Thakkar, Darshan Suresh</field><field name="description">Short Word-Length refers to single-bit, two-bit or ternary processing systems. SWL systems use Sigma-Delta  Modulation (SDM) technique to express an analogue or   multi-bit input signal in terms of a high frequency single-bit stream. In Sigma-Delta Modulation, the input signal is coarsely quantized into a single-bit representation by sampling it at a much higher rate than twice the maximum input frequency viz. the Nyquist rate. This single-bit representation is almost exclusively filtered to remove conversion quantization noise and sample decimated to the Nyquist frequency in preparation for traditional signal processing. SWL algorithms have a huge potential in a variety of applications as they offer many advantages as compared to multi-bit approaches. Features of SWL include efficient hardware implementation, increased flexibility and massive cost savings.       Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are SRAM/FLASH based integrated circuits that can be programmed and re-programmed by the end user. FPGAs are made up of arrays of logic gates, routing channels and I/O blocks. State-of-the-art   FPGAs include features such as Advanced Clock Management, Dedicated Multipliers, DSP Slices, High Speed I/O and Embedded Microprocessors. A System-on-Programmable-Chip (SoPC) design approach uses some or all the aforementioned resources to create a complete processing system on the device itself, ensuring maximum silicon area utilization and higher speed by eliminating inter-chip communication overheads.      This dissertation focuses on the application of SWL processing systems in audio Class-D Amplifiers and aims to prove the claims of efficient hardware implementation and higher speeds of operation. The analog Class-D Amplifier is analyzed and an SWL equivalent of the system is derived by replacing the analogue components with DSP functions wherever possible. The SWL Class-D Amplifier is implemented on an FPGA, the standard emulation platform, using VHSIC Hardware   Description Languages (VHDL). The approach is taken a step forward by adding re-configurability and media selectivity and proposing SDM adaptivity to improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Audio Amplifiers</field><field name="subject">Class-D</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Sigma-Delta Modulation</field><field name="subject">Short Word-Length</field><field name="subject">VHDL</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080806.140908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypervelocity Impact Induced Disturbances on Composite Sandwich Panel Spacecraft Structures</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Shannon</field><field name="description">The next generation of European scientific satellites will carry extremely sensitive measurement devices that require platform stability orders of magnitude higher than current missions. It is considered that the meteoroid and space debris (M/SD) environment poses a risk to the success of these missions as disturbances induced by the impact of these particles at hypervelocity may degrade the platform stability below operational requirements.       In this thesis, disturbances induced by the impact of M/SD particles at hypervelocity on a representative scientific satellite platform have been investigated. An extensive experimental impact test program has been performed, from which an empirical ballistic limit equation (BLE) which defines the conditions of structural perforation for composite sandwich panel structures with CFRP facesheets and aluminium honeycomb cores (CFRP/Al HC SP) has been defined. The BLE is used to predict impact conditions capable of inducing the different excitation modes relevant for a SP sandwich panel structure, enabling a significant reduction in the time and expense usually required for calibrating the protective capability of a new structural configuration.       As experimental acceleration facilities are unable to cover the complete range of possible in-orbit impact conditions relevant for M/SD impact risk assessment, a Hydrocode model of the representative CFRP/Al HC SP has been constructed. A series of impact simulations have been performed during which the local impact-induced disturbance has been measured. The numerical disturbance signals have been validated via comparison with experimental disturbance measurements, and subsequently subject to a characterisation campaign to define the local elastic excitation of the SP structure equivalent to that induced by impact of a M/SD particle at hypervelocity. The disturbance characterisation is made such that it is applicable as an excitation force on a global satellite Finite Element (FE) model, allowing propagation of impact-induced disturbances throughout the complete satellite body to regions of critical stability (i.e. measurement devices). The disturbance induced upon measurement devices by M/SD impacts at both  near- and far-body locations can then be made, allowing the threat to mission objectives to be assessed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space debris</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="subject">hypervelocity impact</field><field name="subject">satellite</field><field name="subject">CFRP</field><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080808.092240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Concepts of Capital and Income in Financial Reporting in the Nineteenth Century</field><field name="creator">Rowles, Thomas (Tom)</field><field name="description">The study is concerned with the conception of capital and income in the changing economic circumstances of the late nineteenth century.  This issue arises as a matter of interest from the confusing accounting for capital assets then followed, and which has become the subject of a small but significant literature.      Methodologically the issue, and the literature it has provoked, provide a 'set' in which an accounting calculation is identified, its context considered and consequences evaluated.  It introduces the idea that accounting had macroeconomic implications, and meets Hopwood's (1983) injunction that accounting ought to be considered in the context in which it arises.  The study illustrates the significance of a flawed accounting founded on an inadequate definition of capital to adversely affect economic life by reference to the legal debate and litigation in English courts about the definition of profit available for distribution as dividends that occurred at the end of the nineteenth century.      The study explores nineteenth century understanding of the concept of capital in economic philosophy on the basis that it would be in that body of philosophic literature that such ideas would have to be examined.  The study finds that, for most of the nineteenth century, understanding of the nature of capital and income derived from the works of William Petty and Adam Smith.  It held that capital and income were separate states of wealth.  This conception of capital continued in the work of David Ricardo, Marx and J. S. Mill, and is evident also in the work of Alfred Marshall.  The modern, twentieth century, understanding of capital and income as antithetical states of wealth is identified in the study as deriving from the work of the American economist Irving Fisher in 1896.      The contribution of this thesis is to   &#149;	Establish that the crisis in late nineteenth century financial reporting derived from  the prevailing conception of capital and its relationship to income,   &#149;	note that the conception in legislative requirements determining profit were consistent with that definition, and    &#149;	identify the origin of the modern, twentieth century understanding of capital and income as antithetical states of wealth.      The study provides an in-principle view that nineteenth century capital accounting had the capacity to cause misallocation of resources within an economy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accounting History</field><field name="subject">Capital Assets</field><field name="subject">Capital and Income</field><field name="subject">Accounting Profit</field><field name="subject">Law and Profit</field><field name="subject">Irving Fisher</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080808.142536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On E-Pseudovarieties of Finite Regular Semigroups</field><field name="creator">Rodgers, James David</field><field name="description">An e-pseudovariety is a class of finite regular semigroups closed under the taking of homomorphic images, regular subsemigroups and finite direct products. Chapter One consists of a survey of those results from algebraic semigroup theory, universal algebra and lattice theory which are used in the following two chapters. In Chapter Two, a theory of generalised existence varieties is developed. A generalised existence variety is a class of regular semigroups closed under the taking of homomorphic images, regular subsemigroups, finite direct products and arbitrary powers. Equivalently, a generalised e-variety is the union of a directed family of existence varieties. It is demonstrated that a class of finite regular semigroups is an e-pseudovariety if and only if the class consists only of the finite members of some generalised existence variety. The relationship between certain lattices of e-pseudovarieties and generalised existence varieties is explored and a usefu l complete surjective lattice homomorphism is found. A study of complete congruences on lattices of existence varieties and e-pseudovarieties forms Chapter Three. In particular it is shown that a certain meet congruence, whose description is relatively simple, can be extended to yield a complete congruence on a lattice of e-pseudovarieties of finite regular semigroups. Ultimately, theorems describing the method of construction of all complete congruences of lattices of e-pseudovarieties whose members are finite E-solid or locally inverse regular semigroups are proved.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">E-pseudovariety</field><field name="subject">existence variety</field><field name="subject">e-variety</field><field name="subject">generalised existence variety</field><field name="subject">regular semigroup</field><field name="subject">complete congruence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080808.155720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleep problems in children with an intellectual disability: The role of child and parent factors, and treatment efficacy using the Signposts program</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Anthony</field><field name="description">The current research considered parent report of sleep problems in children with an intellectual disability (ID). Of specific interest were parents who reported child sleep issues/disturbances but who did not consider their child to have a sleep problem. Also of interest was the use of a general parent-training program to treat both the sleep and behaviour problems in children with an ID.   	Study 1 examined parent perceptions regarding sleep in children with an ID. Parents who reported a child sleep problem provided information on the types of sleep treatment tried and rated their effectiveness. Overall, 243 questionnaires were completed by parents of children with a range of disabilities aged between 3.1 to 18.7 years. While 62% of parents rated their child as displaying problematic night settling, night waking, early waking, or other disturbing sleep behaviours, only 27% of parents considered their child to have a sleep problem. A higher number of parents (75%) than expected had tried at least one type of intervention, although it was not possible to discern 'self help' treatments from 'professionally sought' treatments.   	Study 2 investigated child and parent factors associated with parent perception of sleep problems in children with an ID. Seventy-six parents from Study 1 completed measures in relation to child adaptive and daytime behaviour, parent stress, locus of control, personality (extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism), parenting competence, and perceived control over the child's sleep and daytime behaviour. Based on parent report on a sleep measure and response to the question 'do you think your child has a sleep problem' parents were allocated into one of three sleep groups: Parents who recognised a sleep problem (RSP, N=20), parents whose child did not have a sleep problem (NSP, N=35), and parents who did not recognise their child to have a sleep problem (USP, N=21). The results revealed differences between parents who do (RSP) and parents who do not (USP) recognise their child's sleep problem. These differences related to amount of child sleep (as reported by parents) and parent perceived control over the  child's sleep and daytime behaviour.    	Study 3 examined the efficacy of a general parent-training (behaviour management) program, with sleep used as the training exemplar, for the treatment of sleep problems in children with an ID. Of the 20 parents in the RSP group in Study 2, five agreed to take part in Study 3 and three completed the intervention. The effect of the intervention on (a) a targeted sleep problem, (b) a targeted behaviour problem, (c) other sleep and daytime behaviours, (d) parent stress, (e) parent sleep, (f) parent sense of competence, and (g) parent perceived control over the child's sleep and daytime behaviour were examined. All parents reported an improvement in target sleep behaviour, and at follow-up all of the parents no longer considered their child to have a sleep problem. One parent reported a decrease in stress and an increase in measures of perceived control, and parenting competence, while two parents showed minimal to no improvement on child and parent outcomes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep problems</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">parent report</field><field name="subject">parent perception</field><field name="subject">child factors</field><field name="subject">parent factors</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">satisfaction</field><field name="subject">parent-training</field><field name="subject">behavioural intervention</field><field name="subject">daytime behaviour</field><field name="subject">parent stress</field><field name="subject">perceived control</field><field name="subject">locus of control</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080808.161306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Strategies to Improve Capacity in Hospitality and Tourism Training at East Gippsland Institute of TAFE</field><field name="creator">Rigg, Anne</field><field name="description">This research project has explored the issues surrounding East Gippsland Institute of TAFE's (EGTAFE) inability to expand the training in Hospitality and Tourism (H&amp;T).

The success of the transfection was confirmed using PCR, patch clamp electrophysiology and a non-radioactive rubidium assay. Using a non-radioactive rubidium assay, drug inhibition on the transfected cell line was measured.  The IC50 values obtained for a range of drugs were compared to those obtained using electrophysiological studies in the literature and there was a high correlation (r2 = 0.76).      In Chapter 3, a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) was tested for its validity for testing the effect of drugs on the endogenously expressed HERG K+ channel. The drug IC50 values obtained using the Rb+ assay were well correlated (r2= 0.82) with patch clamp studies in HERG transfected HEK293 cells in the literature.      Clomipramine a clinically used antidepressant causes prolongation in the QT interval, however its mechanism of action on cardiac cells leading to this cardiotoxic effect is unclear.  In this study, clomipramine was tested using HERG transfected HEK293 cells and the neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) using a rubidium assay and whole cell patch clamp.  Clomipramine inhibited HERG with an IC50 value of 8.35 &#181;M and 2.18 &#181;M in HERG transfected HEK293 cells and the neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) using the rubidium assay respectively. Clomipramine inhibited HERG currents with an IC50 value of 0.50 &#181;M using the patch clamp technique in HEK293 cells. The results indicate that the prolongation in the QT interval caused by clomipramine may involve HERG inhibition.      The HERG K+ channel is regulated by several protein kinases including protein kinase A and protein kinase B. In Chapter 5, the specific PKC activator and phorbol ester PDA was used to study HERG regulation by PKC in HERG transfected HEK293 cells. PDA caused a reduction in HERG currents in HEK293 cells. The PKC pseudo substrate inhibitor PKC [19-36] did not inhibit the effect of PDA on HERG currents. The results of the study suggest that (1) PDA could be acting directly on the channel and inhibiting its function or (2) PDA is activating other proteins which are affecting HERG currents in the HERG transfected HEK293 cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HERG</field><field name="subject">safety testing</field><field name="subject">animal-free methodology</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080812.162252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data Mining Using Neural Networks</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Sardar Muhammad Monzurur</field><field name="description">Data mining is about the search for relationships and global patterns in large databases that are increasing in size.  Data mining is beneficial for anyone who has a huge amount of data, for example, customer and business data, transaction, marketing, financial, manufacturing and web data etc. The results of data mining are also referred to as knowledge in the form of rules, regularities and constraints. Rule mining is one of the popular data mining methods since rules provide concise statements of potentially important information that is easily understood by end users and also actionable patterns. At present rule mining has received a good deal of attention and enthusiasm from data mining researchers since rule mining is capable of solving many data mining problems such as classification, association, customer profiling, summarization, segmentation and many others. This thesis makes several contributions by proposing rule mining methods using genetic algorithms  and neural networks.   	The thesis first proposes rule mining methods using a genetic algorithm. These methods are based on an integrated framework but capable of mining three major classes of rules. Moreover, the rule mining processes in these methods are controlled by tuning of two data mining measures such as support and confidence. The thesis shows how to build data mining predictive models using the resultant rules of the proposed methods.    Another key contribution of the thesis is the proposal of rule mining methods using supervised neural networks. The thesis mathematically analyses the Widrow-Hoff learning algorithm of a single-layered neural network, which results in a foundation for rule mining algorithms using single-layered neural networks. Three rule mining algorithms using single-layered neural networks are proposed for the three major classes of rules on the basis of the proposed theorems. The thesis also looks at the problem of rule mining where user guidance is absent. The thesis proposes a guided rule mining system to overcome this problem.  The thesis extends this work further by comparing the performance of the algorithm used in the proposed guided rule mining system with Apriori data mining algorithm.   	Finally, the thesis studies the Kohonen self-organization map as an unsupervised neural network for rule mining algorithms. Two approaches are adopted based on the way of self-organization maps applied in rule mining models. In the first approach, self-organization map is used for clustering, which provides class information to the rule mining process. In the second approach, automated rule mining takes the place of trained neurons as it grows in a hierarchical structure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Neural network</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">Self-organizing map</field><field name="subject">association rule</field><field name="subject">characteristic rule</field><field name="subject">classification rule</field><field name="subject">rule mining</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080813.094814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Investigation of the Tensile Properties and Failure Mechanisms of Three-Dimensional Woven Composites</field><field name="creator">Rudov-Clark, Shoshanna Danielle</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis presents an experimental investigation into the tensile properties, strengthening mechanics and failure mechanisms of three-dimensional (3D) woven composites with through-the-thickness (z-binder) reinforcement.  3D composites are being developed for the aerospace industry for structural applications in next-generation aircraft, such as wing panels, joints and stiffened components.  The use of 3D woven composites in primary aircraft structures cannot occur until there has been a detailed assessment of their mechanical performance, including under tensile loading conditions. The aim of this PhD project is to provide new insights into the in-plane tensile properties, fatigue life, tensile delamination resistance and failure mechanisms of 3D woven composites with different amounts of z-binder reinforcement.  Previous research has revealed that excessive amounts of z-binder reinforcement dramatically improves the tensile delamination toughness, but at  the expense of the in-plane structural properties.  For this reason, this PhD project aims to evaluate the tensile performance of 3D woven composites with relatively small z-binder contents (less than ~1%).  The research aims to provide a better understanding of the manufacture, microstructure and tensile properties of 3D woven composites to assist the process of certification and application of these materials to aircraft structures as well as high performance marine and civil structures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3D WOVEN COMPOSITES</field><field name="subject">TEXTILE PREFORMS</field><field name="subject">TENSILE PROPERTIES</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080808.115853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Image-Space Algorithm for Hardware-Based Rendering of Constructive Solid Geometry</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Nigel Timothy</field><field name="description">A new approach to image-space hardware-based rendering of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) models is presented.  The work is motivated by the evolving functionality and performance of computer graphics hardware.  This work is also motivated by a specific industrial application --- interactive verification of five axis grinding machine tool programs.  The goal is to minimise the amount of time required to render each frame in an animation or interactive application involving boolean combinations of three dimensional shapes. The Sequenced Convex Subtraction (SCS) algorithm utilises sequenced subtraction of convex objects for the purpose of interactive CSG rendering.  Concave shapes must be decomposed into convex shapes for the purpose of rendering.  The length of Permutation Embedding Sequences (PESs) used as subtraction sequences are shown to have a quadratic lower bound.  In many situations shorter sequences can be used, in the best case linear.  Approaches to s ubtraction sequence encoding are presented including the use of object-space overlap information.  The implementation of the algorithm is experimentally shown to perform better on modern commodity graphics hardware than previously reported methods.  This work also examines performance aspects of the SCS algorithm itself.  Overall performance depends on hardware characteristics, the number and spatial arrangement of primitives, and the structure and boolean operators of the CSG tree.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constructive Solid Geometry</field><field name="subject">CSG</field><field name="subject">CSG Rendering</field><field name="subject">Rendering Algorithm</field><field name="subject">Permutation Embedding Sequence</field><field name="subject">NC Verification</field><field name="subject">SCS</field><field name="subject">Sequenced Convex Subtraction</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080721.144757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Politics of Empowerment in Australian Critical Social work</field><field name="creator">Bay, Uschi Ursula</field><field name="description">Critical social workers seek to practice in empowering ways with marginal groups and to transform power relations in organisations and society generally.

This makes the use of Foucault's insights on power to re-formulate empowerment practice contestable. In this study I aim to draw distinctions between aspects of Foucault's work that can make a contribution to empowerment practice and those aspects that do not or cannot assist critical social workers to think about empowerment.

The possibility of using high pressure processing (HPP) for controlling these problems was investigated in a commercially manufactured fresh lactic curd cheese (pH 4.3-4.4) and fermented milk models (pH 4.3-6.5). The effects of HPP at 300 and 600 MPa on inactivation of glycolytic enzymes of lactic acid bacteria were also evaluated.      Fresh cheeses made from pasteurised bovine milk using a commercial Lactococcus starter preparation were treated with high pressures ranging from 200 to 600 MPa (less than or equal to 22&#176;C, 5 min) under vacuum packaging conditions and subsequently stored at 4&#176;C for 8 weeks. Treatment at greater than or equal to 300 MPa substantially reduced the viable count of Lactococcus and effectively prevented the outgrowth of yeasts and moulds for 6 to 8 weeks without adversely affecting the sensory and textural attributes of the product. However, it had no significant effects (p less than 0.01) on variation of titratable acidity during storage.       Fermented milk models were prepared by individually growing Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C10, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris BK5, Streptococcus thermophilus TS1, Lactobacillus acidophilus 2400 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 2517 in UHT skim milk and diluting the resulting fermented milk with UHT skim milk up to pH 6.5. Pressure treatment of the milk models at pH 5.2 resulted in substantial inhibition of post-processing acidification during storage and markedly reduced the viable count of Lactococcus at both 300 and 600 MPa and other bacteria only at 600 MPa.      Treatment of the milk model at 600 MPa decreased the viable counts of Candida zeylanoides and Candida lipolytica (wildtype spoilage yeasts of lactic curd cheese, added as challenge cultures) from 105 CFU mL-1 to below the detection limit (log 0 CFU mL-1) at all pH levels tested (pH 4.3-6.5) and effectively controlled their outgrowth for 8 weeks. Treatment of milk model at 300 MPa had a similar effect only on C. zeylanoides. The viable count of C. lipolytica was reduced by 2.6, 2.4 and 2.3 logs by treatment at 300 MPa at pH levels of 4.3, 5.2 and 6.5, respectively, which subsequently recovered by 2.9, 2.8 and 3.2 logs within 3 weeks.      Glycolytic enzymes of various starter bacteria showed different responses to pressure treatment. The lactate dehydrogenase in L. lactis subsp. lactis and Lb. acidophilus was quite resistant to pressures up to 600 MPa, but it was almost completely inactivated in S. thermophilus at pressure levels as low as 300 MPa. The &#226;-galactosidase in Lb. acidophilus was more pressure stable than &#226;-galactosidase in S. thermophilus and Phospho-&#226;-galactosidase in L. lactis subsp. lactis.      The findings of this study suggests HPP at 300-600 MPa as an effective method for controlling the outgrowth of some spoilage yeasts and moulds in fresh lactic curd cheeses. The results obtained with selected lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk models can be used to assist in establishing HPP operating parameters for development of new generation cultured dairy products, of reduced acidity and extended shelf-life.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fresh lactic curd cheese</field><field name="subject">Post-processing acidification</field><field name="subject">Shelf-life</field><field name="subject">High pressure processing</field><field name="subject">Glycolytic enzymes</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid bacteria</field><field name="subject">Yeasts and moulds</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080821.155923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Technology Architect Capabilities: Which are important and can they be improved?</field><field name="creator">Frampton, Keith MacKenzie</field><field name="description">Information Technology (IT) systems have become essential components of our society.  These IT systems have an internal structure called the system's architecture.  This architecture directly affects the system's performance and ability to meet business objectives.  The people who design this structure are called IT Architects.  Investigating the capabilities that distinguish highly-skilled IT Architects contributes to IT knowledge and practice and supports improving the design of systems' architectures as well as the selection and development of IT Architects.        This thesis examines some of the capabilities that distinguish highly-skilled IT Architects and applies the resulting understanding to the education of post-graduate IT students.  By investigating selected capabilities of highly-skilled IT Architects, how this group of IT Architects differ from their colleagues with respect to highly-valued capabilities and how these capabilities could be taught, we clarify both a professional and an educational basis for improvement.      The research has a three stage, multi-method design.  The initial stage, undertaken in 2004, consists of interview-based qualitative research with fourteen practicing IT Architects to understand the characteristics of highly-skilled IT Architects.  The interviewees were chosen through personal relationships and subsequent snowball sampling and through the interviews and subsequent analysis, we identify eight capabilities, four personality traits and a range of experience that is valuable for highly-skilled IT Architects.  These results support prior research that identified the importance of communications and business knowledge while extending the range of valuable characteristics for the IT Architect role.      The next quantitative stage surveys 82 practicing IT Architects and 97 other IT professionals using four psychological measures; the Cognitive Style Inventory (CSI), the Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), and Zimbardo's Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI).  The analysis, undertaken in 2005, identifies two statistically significant differentiating capabilities that distinguish highly-skilled IT Architects from less skilled IT Architects.  The first capability is that the highly-skilled IT Architects approach problems differently and generate more alternatives before attempting solutions and spend more effort evaluating outcomes than the less skilled IT Architects.  The second capability is that the less skilled IT Architects have a different attitude towards time and do not always act consistently with a longer term perspective.      The final stage of research investigates whether the teaching of material related to the two distinguishing capabilities improve students outcomes for these capabilities.  In 2006 we measured the initial student capability level of 35 students, the level of 28 of these students at the conclusion of the subject, and again in 2007, one-year later 16 students were measured.  We again use quantitative surveys with the PSI and ZTPI instruments and found that whilst we measure a change in student capability for problem solving, the two capabilities we targeted are not significantly affected through the teaching.  Interviews with the participants indicate that the teaching is effective and the lack of significant differences in the targeted capabilities is because of external factors overriding what they are learning.      Our research contributes to the field of Computer Science and Information Technology by providing:   (i)	the basis for improved identification and selection of IT Architects for industry and providing additional information to enhance their professional education through the identification of distinguishing capabilities of highly-skilled IT Architects;    (ii)	information for educators about IT Architect capabilities and capability development that are important for highly-skilled IT Architects and some considerations when teaching these capabilities;    (iii)	a foundation for research that compares and contrasts capabilities within other IT professions; and    (iv)	results that can be used to improve the process of architecting IT systems.       More generally, the research contributes to the body of knowledge regarding IT skills and requirements for different roles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skills</field><field name="subject">IT architects</field><field name="subject">software engineering education</field><field name="subject">workforce</field><field name="subject">capabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080821.161427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Characterisation of Salmonella enterica Serovar Sofia in Australia</field><field name="creator">Gan Teck Fong, Emily</field><field name="description">Despite its high isolation frequency in Australian chickens, S. II Sofia is rarely associated with animals or human salmonellosis as this serovar is avirulent in nature. The reason for its persistence and avirulence is unknown as very few studies have been conducted on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this strain. This study details the various experimental methods utilised to investigate the genetic relatedness and molecular mechanisms involved in S. II Sofia pathogenesis. Using PFGE and Rep-PCR, the Australian S. II Sofia isolates were found to show limited genetic diversity and probably share a clonal relationship. A majority of the S. II Sofia isolates were not geographically restricted with the predominant pattern subtype spread out among the isolates from various states.      Distribution and variation of the SPI-associated virulence genes within S. II Sofia was also examined. Based on RFLP and sequence analysis, most of the differences observed in SPI1 to SPI5 of S. II Sofia could be attributed to a loss or gain of restriction cleavage sites within these regions. However, a number of genes in SPI1, SPI2, SPI3 and SPI5 were found to have accumulated changes (mutations, insertions and deletions) that could have affected gene transcription and/or protein translation - these genes have been shown to be involved in different aspects of the virulence process. The avirulence of S. II Sofia is probably not the result of a single genetic change but rather a series of alterations to a large number of its virulence-associated genes.       Plasmid-mediated virulence was also assessed in S. II Sofia isolates. Southern hybridisation with probes derived from the virulence plasmid of S. Typhimurium indicated either the total absence of the virulence plasmid or possible presence of a virulence plasmid containing major deletions. Clones were constructed with the missing spv operon using high-copy pCR&#174;2.1 and low-copy pWSK29 plasmids and the adherence, invasion and intracellular survival of the mutant strain was evaluated in vitro. The presence of spvRABCD was shown to have no effect on intracellular survival and replication. Although the cloning of spv with pCR&#174;2.1 was observed to significantly increase invasiveness of S. II Sofia, it was not capable of restoring the invasive ability of S. II Sofia to the level of pathogenic S. Typhimurium 82/6915. On the other hand, the uneven adherence and invasion ability of the other mutant strains appeared to be linked to the presence of pWSK29 and this observation is further supported by RT-PCR analysis of the  clones - indicating that perhaps pWSK29 is not a suitable vector for this study.            Wild-type S. II Sofia isolates are unlikely to regain full pathogenicity because of the numerous mutations in many important virulence genes: even the chance acquisition of a virulence factor (e.g. spvRABCD) is not sufficient to completely restore S. II Sofia virulence. Therefore, S. II Sofia should not be considered similar to other Salmonella spp. when monitoring Salmonellae in food samples.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salmonella enterica Serovar Sofia</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080821.163140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into Reliability Based Methods to Include Risk of Failure in Life Cycle Cost Analysis of Reinforced Concrete Bridge Rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Weiqi</field><field name="description">Reliability based life cycle cost analysis is becoming an important consideration for decision-making in relation to bridge design, maintenance and rehabilitation.

Research work presented here aimed to develop a methodology for evaluation of the risk of failure of reinforced concrete bridges to assist in decision making on rehabilitation. Methodology proposed here combines fault tree analysis and probabilistic time-dependent reliability analysis to achieve qualitative and quantitative assessment of the risk of failure. Various uncertainties are considered including the degradation of resistance due to initiation of a particular distress mechanism, increasing load effects, changes in resistance as a result of rehabilitation, environmental variables, material properties and model errors. It was shown that the proposed methodology has the ability to provide users two alternative approaches for qualitative or quantitative assessment of the risk of failure depending on availability of detailed data.

Such a development brings organizations with numerous benefits including increased automation of business processes, improved customer service, and timely provision of effective decision support. As a result, evaluating and selecting the most appropriate IS project for development and implementation from a pool of available IS projects becomes a critical decision to make in modern organizations.      Evaluating and selecting appropriate IS projects for development in an organization, however, is complex and challenging. The complexity of the evaluation and selection process is due to the multi-dimensional nature of the decision making process, the conflicting nature of the multiple selection criteria, and the presence of subjectiveness and imprecision of the human decision making process. The challenging of the evaluation and selection comes from the need for making transparent and balanced decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation of all available IS projects in a timely manner.      Much research has been done on the development of various approaches for evaluating and selecting IS projects, and numerous applications of those approaches for addressing real world IS project evaluation and selection problems have been reported in the literature. In general, existing approaches can be classified into (a) cost-benefit analysis based approaches, (b) utility based approaches, and (c) optimization oriented approaches. These approaches, however, are not totally satisfactory due to various shortcomings including (a) the inability to tackle the subjectiveness and imprecision of the selection process, (b) the failure to adequately handle the multi-dimensional nature of the problem, and (c) cognitively very demanding on the decision maker.      To address these issues above, this research has developed three novel approaches for effectively solving the IS project evaluation and selection problem under uncertainty in an organization. The first approach is developed for helping the decision maker better model the subjectiveness and imprecision inherent in the decision-making process with the use of linguistic variables approximated by fuzzy numbers. The second approach is designed to reduce the cognitive demanding on the decision maker in the IS project evaluation and selection process with the introduction of fuzzy pairwise comparison. The third approach is formulated with respect to the use of intelligent decision support systems for facilitating the use of specific multi-criteria analysis approaches in relation to individual IS project evaluation and selection situations. The developed approaches have been applied for solving three IS project evaluation and selection problems in the real world settings. The results show that the three developed ap proaches are of practical significance for effectively and efficiently solving the IS project evaluation and selection problem due to (a) the simplicity and comprehensibility of the underlying concept, (b) the adequate handling of inherent uncertainty and imprecision, and (c) the ability to help the decision maker better understand the IS project selection problem and the implications of their decision behaviours.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information Systems Project Selection</field><field name="subject">Multi-criteria Analysis</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty and Subjectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080822.142200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Discretization of Sliding Mode Control Systems</field><field name="creator">Wang, Bin</field><field name="description">Sliding mode control (SMC) has been successfully applied to many practical control problems due to its attractive features such as invariance to matched uncertainties. The characteristic feature of a continuous-time SMC system is that sliding mode occurs on a prescribed manifold, where switching control is employed to maintain the state on the surface. When a sliding mode is realized, the system exhibits some superior robustness properties with respect to external matched uncertainties. However, the realization of the ideal sliding mode requires switching with an infinite frequency.      Control algorithms are now commonly implemented in digital electronics due to the increasingly affordable microprocessor hardware although the essential conceptual framework of the feedback design still remains to be in the continuous-time domain.      Discrete sliding mode control has been extensively studied to address some basic questions associated with the sliding mode control of discrete-time systems with relatively low switching frequencies. However, the complex dynamical behaviours due to discretization in continuous-time SMC systems have not yet been fully explored.      In this thesis, the discretization behaviours of SMC systems are investigated. In particular, one of the most frequently used discretization schemes for digital controller implementation, the zero-order-holder discretization, is studied. First, single-input   SMC systems are discretized, stability and boundary conditions of the digitized SMC systems are derived. Furthermore, some inherent dynamical properties such as periodic phenomenon, of the discretized SMC systems are studied. We also explored the discretization behaviours of the disturbed SMC systems. Their steady-state behaviours are discussed using a symbolic dynamics approach under the constant and periodic matched uncertainties.      Next, discretized high-order SMC systems and sliding mode based observers are explored using the same analysis method.

Despite the apparent need for such interventions, current studies show inconsistent results regarding program effectiveness, with meta-analyses indicating only marginal effects for some disease groups. A closer examination of these studies however suggests that the magnitude and inconsistency of the findings may be related to the types of outcomes that were assessed rather than specific disease groups. Where self-report measures were used, results tended to be smaller and inconsistent. It is therefore possible that current studies do not adequately reflect program effects because self-report outcomes have a high risk to be confounded by a range of potential biases.   Objective   The aim of this thesis was to identify and quantify the potential influence of biases in the measurement of change in chronic disease self-management interventions using self-report.   Methods   The research design targeted the processes that individuals undergo when filling out questionnaires and whether this has an influence on their self-report outcomes. This was achieved by developing a three-group research design. The Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) was used to collect outcomes data. While pretest questionnaires were identical across groups, three questionnaire versions were randomly distributed at posttest. One of the groups filled out traditional posttest questions (n=331), whereas the other two groups were asked to provide data in addition to posttest questions, with one group providing transition questions (n=304) and one providing retrospective pretest data (n=314). Resulting datasets were further examined for possible confounding effects through response shift and social desirability bias. Through the random allocation of the heiQs it was ensured that data were not influenced by potential intra-group effects.   Results   The thesis revealed that the design of the posttest questionnaire significantly influenced people's ratings of their posttest levels. In particular, when participants were asked to provide ratings of their retrospective pretest levels in addition to their posttest levels, the latter scores were significantly higher than those of participants who did not perform this additional task. Subsequent analyses however suggested that these differences could neither be explained by response shift nor by social desirability bias.   Conclusions   This research has provided important insight into the measurement of outcomes of chronic disease self-management interventions. While the threat to the validity of traditional pretest-posttest data due to confounding effects through response shift and social desirability biases could not be supported, the thesis has highlighted that the cognitive task that subjects are asked to perform when providing data at posttest significantly influenced their self-reported outcomes. Given that previous research has predominantly focused on other aspects of validity - such as applying control group designs to circumvent common threats to internal and external validity - this study suggests that more attention must be paid to the design of questionnaires. The thesis concludes that further research, in particular into the influence of cognitive tasks on obtained scores, is important to improve the interpretation of self-report outcomes data derived from participants of self-management interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Program evaluation</field><field name="subject">outcomes assessment</field><field name="subject">chronic disease</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="subject">health education</field><field name="subject">self-management</field><field name="subject">response shift</field><field name="subject">thentest</field><field name="subject">retrospective pretest</field><field name="subject">social desirability</field><field name="subject">factor analysis</field><field name="subject">measurement invariance</field><field name="subject">partial mediation</field><field name="subject">Structural Equation Modeling</field><field name="subject">Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080822.151606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Allegorical Fold.

This examination will re-present, reinterpret, fragment and transform the selected images using the materials of oil painting and drawing to visualize my response to the changing perceptions of this phenomenon.      This investigation is informed by philosophical and psychoanalytical writings that explore the phenomenology of states of presence and absence. In part, these states are suggested by other terminologies, for example, form and space or volume and void. The project draws on the work of writers who have examined and changed perceptions of this phenomenon, particularly where they attribute the structure of absence to contribute to an understanding of subjectivity, question the favouring of presence in Western thought and explore the relationship between the two.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Allegorical</field><field name="subject">Fold</field><field name="subject">Presence</field><field name="subject">Absence</field><field name="subject">Embodied</field><field name="subject">Drapery</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080828.152600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling The Economic Impact of A Farming Innovation Group On A Regional Economy - A Top-Down Versus Hybrid Input-Output Approach</field><field name="creator">Gangemi, Michael Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis involves construction of input-output models measuring the economic impact of a farming innovation organisation (The Birchip Cropping Group) on the Victorian regional economy of Buloke Shire. The input-output modeling undertaken is of two forms; the first being a simple na&#239;ve top-down model, and the second a more sophisticated hybrid model. The na&#239;ve top-down model is based on input-output coefficients drawn from the Australian national input-output tables, and is regarded as na&#239;ve because these input-output coefficients are not adjusted to take account of local economic factors. The hybrid model uses the same national input-output coefficients as a base, and then modifies these coefficients to better reflect industrial conditions in the Shire using a location quotients-adjustment technique, as well as using original survey data collected from entities operating in Buloke Shire.      One of the aims of the thesis is to determine whether the simpler na&#239;ve top-down approach produces results consistent with the theoretically more accurate hybrid methodology, and thus whether the na&#239;ve top-down approach represents a reliable method of conducting regional economic impact analysis. That is, can such studies be undertaken accurately using a na&#239;ve top down approach, or is it necessary to adopt the more resource intensive methodology of a hybrid model.   The results of the analysis suggest construction of a hybrid model is advisable, as generally the na&#239;ve top-down approach produces over-estimates of the economic effects of the Birchip Cropping Group. That is, it appears the economic impact multipliers estimated with the na&#239;ve top-down model are too large, suggesting the time and effort involved in constructing the hybrid model was worthwhile.   Using the hybrid model, the conclusion is that the Birchip Cropping Group has a significant affect on the regional economy of Buloke Shire, with the economic impact being estimated at close to $600,000 in additional output, $61,000 in additional income,  and 3.5 additional jobs per year.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">input-output</field><field name="subject">top-down input-output</field><field name="subject">hybrid input-output</field><field name="subject">regional economic impact analysis</field><field name="subject">farming innovation group</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080828.163749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-comparisons of rape and rape myth endorsement through analysis of existing modified rape myth items.</field><field name="creator">Granger, Kara</field><field name="description">Traditionally, rape has been viewed as a crime perpetrated by men against women. However, it is now recognised that males can also be victims of rape. The current research had several interrelated aims to; (i) provide a profile of both male and female rape victims, (ii) compare the characteristics of rape perpetrated against male and female victims, (iii) estimate the incidence of male and female rape within the general community, (iv) describe the reporting practices of rape victims, and (v) determine the relationship between rape and depression, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts. The community's level of rape myth endorsement was also explored. Rape myths were defined as attitudes and beliefs about rape, rape victims, and rapists that are generally false but are widely and persistently held, and serve to deny and justify sexual aggression against women and men. The present study compared rape myth endorsement levels concerning both male and female victims.  However, it was first necessary to construct a rape myth questionnaire, the Rape Attitudinal Scale (RAQ), which minimised the methodological limitations of pre-existing scales. The current research utilised online methodology and, in total, 560 individuals participated in the research. It was found that almost two out of every five participants had been a victim of rape during their lifetime, with males accounting for 8.60% of the raped sample. Rape victims emanated from a variety of demographic backgrounds and the gender differences between the characteristics of the rape were discussed.  Approximately one in seven rape victims stated that they had reported the rape to police, with half of those rape victims regretting informing the police of their experience. Almost twice as many female rape victims than male rape victims failed to report their rape to anyone.

The transnational movements of people across the globe, as well as tensions arising from religious and political differences, are highlighting the urgent need for people to learn to recognize and negotiate their being with difference. In recent years the Australian media has reflected growing interest on issues concerning identity and national values. These issues are invariably translated into the educational system and then into the classroom. In this context there arises the tension between recognizing and responding to individual difference yet, on the other hand, a push for sameness under the rubric of social equality. Diversity as an objective phenomenon has received much attention in the educational literature however the experience of a teacher being with difference in the classroom and what a teacher experiences as 'being different' has been assumed and  the meanings they make of their experiences largely ignored.       The purpose of this hermeneutic phenomenological study was to reveal and interpret the lived experiences of teachers being with difference, as they construct the phenomenon, in the context of the primary classroom. Data sources predominantly included extended face-to-face multiple interviews with thirteen teachers from primary schools situated in Melbourne, Australia. Personal experiences, as well as perspectives derived from a range of literature, were also employed. The collated texts revealed six dominant themes: [1] Disrupted by difference [2] Stimulated by difference [3] Engineering for difference [4] Labelling for difference [5] Awakened by difference; and [6] Sensitized by difference. Each theme was explicated using a variety of textual approaches to better understand the structures of meanings. Essentially, the phenomenon, as revealed by the participating teachers, suggests that difference in the classroom is constructed through teachers' own cultural and experiential lenses and interpreted according ly. Two particular implications arising from the study are discussed. The first concerns teachers 'growing children to be like me' and the second, the magnetism of difference and its implication for children perceived as 'ordinary'. The implication of these findings suggests that 'being with difference' presents fundamental challenges for teachers who must not only accommodate novel experiences within their own teaching and personal lifeworlds and address those challenges within the procedural expectations of an educational system, but are also in a position to facilitate a literacy of being with difference.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">difference</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">teachers</field><field name="subject">classroom</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080829.143822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical spectroscopy characterization of nano-scale photonic structures</field><field name="creator">Qasim, Hasan</field><field name="description">Current micro-scale electronics technology has been approaching rapidly towards its technological limit. This has shifted the focus towards nano-scale technology in recent years. More and more researchers around the globe are working in pursuit of bringing nano-scale technology into mainstream.                  The research carried out here is a small step towards a similar goal. The remarkable optical properties exhibited by certain nano-scale structures are in stark contrast to their bulk form and this provides the basis for this research.                 Two kinds of nanostructures are developed and investigated for their optical properties. One of these is nanofibers processed from a polymer known as polyaniline (PANI). The focus of this study is to investigate its optical and conductive properties under different conditions of doping environments, temperature and polymerization conditions. Optical characterization technique such as UV-Visible spectroscopy is developed to carry out the investigation. The developed nanofibers have been demonstrated to possess optical and conductive properties to be dependent on doping variables.  Study of these optical properties could prove very useful in the development of electrochromic devices and gas sensors. Later in the research, UV-Visible spectroscopy has been improved into a low cost Raman spectroscopy setup which is validated by experimentation carried out on some samples.                  The second type of nano-structure developed and investigated, is an array of nanoparticles of noble metals such as gold and silver. Such an array is shown to exhibit a phenomenon called plasmon resonance effect when excited by light. UV-Visible spectroscopy technique is utilized to investigate this effect for metal nano-arrays. A biologically nano-structured surface (wing of an insect called cicada) is used as the substrate for the fabrication of metal array. A serious attempt has also been made to do 'Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)', making use of the metal nano-array developed. This technique improves the raman lines intensities of certain less sensitive samples such as thiophenol, which are known to give weak raman lines. This is carried out by adsorbing the sample on the metal nano-array.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Polyaniline</field><field name="subject">Raman spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Cicada</field><field name="subject">Nano-particle</field><field name="subject">Nano-structure</field><field name="subject">Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080829.162734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of recycled PET and its application for blow moulded containers requiring thermal stability at elevated tempoeratures.</field><field name="creator">Patuto, Joseph</field><field name="description">Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) has become the preferred material of choice for many packaging applications.  A preference over glass due to its low weight, similar transparency to glass and cost consideration, including the availability of recycled PET feedstock via kerbside collection has provided newer opportunities for hot-fill applications. Ostensibly, this material is used for beverage markets requiring cold and hot filling (85 oC) of liquid foods. However due to the poor thermal stability of PET  - due to its low glass transition temperature - an increase in elevated temperatures limits the number of market segments the material can be utilised.       Current practices incorporate the heat-set process, aimed at improving the crystallisation kinetics within the amorphous and crystalline region. This body of work incorporates a single stage Injection Stretch Blow Moulding machine (ISBM). Modifications to conventional carbonated soft drink (CSD) beverage containers to include heat-set capabilities are incorporated.       The current research study investigates the potential benefits of RPET blends for improving thermal stability at elevated temperatures. This study investigates changes in mechanical properties which include   &#149;	Youngs modulus,    &#149;	top load strength,    &#149;	burst strength,    &#149;	Thermal analysis specifically investigating changes in    &#149;	Glass transition temperature,    &#149;	enthalpy changes due to heat-set conditions   &#149;	Percentage crystallinity changes as a function of heat-set conditions       Rheological characteristics to all materials used were investigates.

Upon completion to an exhaustive experimental ISBM trial, a DoE software package - in this case Echip - was used to analyse and predict optimised hot-fill shrinkage values of 2.5 percent with a maximum constrained RPET blend value totalling 40 percent. ISBM optimised conditions demonstrated advantages when combining an increased preform surface temperature, RPET blends and optimised ISBM process conditions as indicated via the DoE at low heat-set temperatures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PET</field><field name="subject">packaging</field><field name="subject">injection stretch blow moulding</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080901.114534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of Controlling Colour and Aesthetic Appearance of the Photographic Salt Print</field><field name="creator">Young, Eleanor Dawn</field><field name="description">Abstract   The salt print is an important part of photography, both in its historic value and in the tonal range it can provide. This tonal range is greater than any other photographic printing process available to date attributed to the inherent masking ability of the metallic silver. However the intrinsic production problems have made it a 'forgotten' process. There are five key problems.    1.	The difficulties in achieving the potential extensive tonal range.   2.	The varying colour of the print.    3.	Staining that appears in the print, during and after processing.    4.	Instability and longevity of the salt print.   5.	Contradictory and inaccurate information in material published on the salt print.     Although the emphasis of the research is on exploring and controlling the colour and tonal range, the staining problems and stability of the print are also addressed.    The materials used for contact negatives today vary in both capture and output, from analogue film processed in the traditional wet darkroom to a variety of transparent film printed from digital files. Inadequate density and tonal range can affect all types of negatives. To provide sufficient exposure time for the salt prints extended tonal range adjustments to the negative were necessary. These long exposures then converted sufficient silver salts to the image making metallic silver, utilising the intrinsic self-masking process.     Ultimately this research has uncovered ways to control colour and tonal range and certain aesthetic qualities of the salt print, while simultaneously resolving some of the conflicts in published information. Accurate and consistent methods of processing eliminate staining, providing some stability to the print. The activities and steps carried out to make a salt print are manual; precise duplication is therefore almost unattainable. Nevertheless, although tests on a densitometer may display numeric differences, visual differences are barely noticeable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salt print</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="subject">tonal range</field><field name="subject">metallic silver</field><field name="subject">William Henry Fox Talbot</field><field name="subject">silver nitrate</field><field name="subject">silver chloride</field><field name="subject">albumen</field><field name="subject">gelatin</field><field name="subject">starch</field><field name="subject">light sensitive</field><field name="subject">developed-out</field><field name="subject">printed-out</field><field name="subject">contact print</field><field name="subject">negatives</field><field name="subject">toning</field><field name="subject">cotton paper</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080901.142948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a New Constitutionalism: Developing Global Civic Responsibility through Participation in World Constitutional Deliberation</field><field name="creator">Mochelle, Richard</field><field name="description">Confronted by major global problems, our 'foremost challenge', according to the 1995 report of the Commission on Global Governance, is to develop the vision of a better world - one   more democratic, secure and sustainable. The report concludes with a call for 'a global civic   ethic' - for commitment by all to a set of globally protective responsibilities. The thesis asks, what does this challenge imply? How to achieve an effective response? What provisions, in principle, ought to be instituted to meet the Commission's call?      The call is a tall order: for a quantum leap from passive, rights-oriented, civic culture to one based on global responsibility. The thesis is not concerned with the probability of such shift occurring. The premise is that if we believe that the call ought to be met, that it commands an ethical response from all, we ought first to comprehend the ethical and practical complications, and second, seek to comply with them. The thesis is concerned with the first obligation. It requires an inquiry disciplined by moral reasoning and persistent focus on the long range, world future. It has led the thesis into somewhat underdeveloped terrains. The call to enact global civic responsibilities implicitly entreats us to recognise the validity and gentle power of Kant's categorical imperative, to unleash it from its remote, theoretical mountaintop and allow it to reign supreme as the preeminent, constitutional principle for personal and global governance. The thesis argues that this recognition will require, and result in , a new, education-led constitutionalism centred on civic integrity development. Logically derived from the Golden Rule, the categorical imperative and its universality and moral autonomy constraints are adopted by the inquiry, somewhat experimentally, as a methodological discipline. For it is argued that such discipline should be cultivated by the new, education-based constitutionalism. This requires persistent, uncompromising focus on the universal ought. Where ought leads, the inquiry follows, even when it invokes an apparently 'unrealistic' future beyond the margins of current educational and constitutional practice. The new constitutionalism appears vaguely outlined on the horizon, largely beyond political and educational experience. The thesis moves towards this horizon to consider grounding assumptions and transit impediments, with the goal, above all, to determine the more prominent, 'in principle' landmarks toward which the world's educational resources could be steered. The term constitution is min imally defined as a paramount, overarching strategy of mutual protection, not bound to current national constitutions, territories, and identities, nor to familiar constitution-making processes. Invoked by growing recognition of global interdependence and mutual risk, it stands for inclusive protection, ideally of, by and for 'We the People of the World'. The Commission's recommendation that people should deliberate on 'the vision of a better world' has been pursued by futurists since the 1960s. Their pioneering ventures are examined in chapter 2 and found contributive yet insufficient to meet the constitutional requirements implied by the Commission's challenge. Various conceptual and practical obstacles impede effective response to the challenge. These preoccupy much of chapter 2 and indeed the whole thesis. The new constitutionalism presupposes, as does prevailing national constitutionalism, that despite cultural differences, there are certain universal interests that all want protected. Most would want r eliable protection against preventable mayhem, slaughter and environmental destruction. It is argued in chapter 3 that while the universalist assumption can reasonably withstand relativist scepticism, universal interests remain to be identified. Upon examination of notable identification procedures it is asked 'should this be left to social researchers'? Arguments are raised to suggest that, as a civic harm preventative measure, all people should be constitutionally required to identify these interests. Universal interests cannot be protected while people take no responsibility for their protection. Were the Commission's call for globally responsible civic culture taken seriously, what would this imply for world political economy? Chapter 4 undertakes an exercise in future-oriented normative inquiry to explore world constitutional implications in outline. Revealed on the horizon is a new economic game with new words: the priactive constitution. The exercise demonstrates the challenging nature of the substant ive ethical agenda confronting deliberants of the new constitutionalism. What right does one have to participate in world constitutional deliberations and consider such agendas? Chapter 5 argues that one has a right, and a responsibility to do so. The arguments appeal to the democratic ideal, political legitimacy, the Golden Rule, the defence role of citizenship and the fact that each imposes the world constitutional order on all. But the participatory right and responsibility cannot be exercised without universally accessible constitutional fora, procedures and education. The theoretical ideals of deliberative democracy are summoned. The current technical feasibility of creating an Internet-based system of democratic deliberative provisions is illustrated in the Appendix. Even were such provisions made available, a key impediment to effective response to the Commission's call is that most work-committed adults are unlikely to volunteer substantial time for the learning engagement. Given the unacceptability  of political coercion, chapter 6 considers the moral proposition that youngsters worldwide be submitted to the learning challenge in their years of compulsory education. The literature on moral justifications for compulsory education reveals considerable disagreement. These justifications seem anyhow unrelated to curriculum priorities that are actually imposed on captive audiences. As highlighted by the World Trade Centre attack, the world's people have little constitutional protection against deceptive doctrines conveyed in distant classrooms. A key problem for global governance is whether the world's teachers should not be constitutionally obligated to promote and exemplify globally protective responsibilities. Chapter 6 argues that universal compulsory education can be ethically justified for the protection of universal interests only when civic integrity development is maintained as the curriculum priority. This would develop global civic responsibilities in teachers and students through exercising their  participation in world constitutional deliberation under the counterindoctrination constraints of the categorical imperative. It would entail deliberation on universal interests in view of global threats, alternative normative strategies to protect those interests, and public disclosure of normative commitments. Moreover, by tapping the real interests of students, adult literacy expectations, linguistic, moral, ecological and political, could be more readily met. But such educational strategy might not suffice to assure reliable enactment of civic responsibilities. It is argued that 'school' might need replacing or augmenting with environmentally rich learning settings that could enable chosen norms to be experienced and demonstrated. The thesis concludes that implementation of the new, education-centred constitutionalism implied by the Commission's call will first require an engaged response from educators. It is recommended that a global network be established linking key persons in schools and university  faculties who will take responsibility for activating curriculum and community response to the Commission's call and, in the first instance, engage themselves in civic integrity development to acquire facilitator competencies.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">civics</field><field name="subject">constitutionalism</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080902.091320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-molecular-weight subunits of glutelin in wheat and related species : their characterization, genetics and relation to bread-making quality</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Ram Bilas.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves [133]-151.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Proteins Analysis</field><field name="subject">Wheat</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phg977.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6629203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological System Modelling and   Clinical Simulation for Diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Loh, Kah Meng</field><field name="description">none supplied</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">none supplied</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080910.143512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Techniques for Enhancing the Robustness and Performance of Speciated PSOs in Multimodal Environments</field><field name="creator">Bird, Stefan Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes several new techniques to improve the performance of speciated particle swarms in multimodal environments. We investigate how these algorithms can become more robust and adaptive, easier to use and able to solve a wider variety of optimisation problems. We then develop a technique that uses regression to vastly improve an algorithm's convergence speed without requiring extra evaluations.       Speciation techniques play an important role in particle swarms. They allow an algorithm to locate multiple optima, providing the user with a choice of solutions. Speciation also provides diversity preservation, which can be critical for dynamic optimisation. By increasing diversity and tracking multiple peaks simultaneously, speciated algorithms are better able to handle the changes inherent in dynamic environments.       Speciation algorithms often require a user to specify a parameter that controls how species form. This is a major drawback since the knowledge may not be available a priori. If the parameter is incorrectly set, the algorithm's performance is likely to be highly degraded. We propose using a time-based measure to control the speciation, allowing the algorithm to define species far more adaptively, using the population's characteristics and behaviour to control membership.       Two new techniques presented in this thesis, ANPSO and ESPSO, use time-based convergence measures to define species. These methods are shown to be robust while still providing highly competitive performance. Both algorithms effectively optimised all of our test functions without requiring any tuning.       Speciated algorithms are ideally suited to optimising dynamic environments, however the complexity of these environments makes them far more difficult to design algorithms for. To increase an algorithm's performance it is necessary to determine in what ways it should be improved. While all performance metrics allow optimisation techniques to be compared, they cannot show how to improve an algorithm. Until now this has been done largely by trial and error. This is extremely inefficient, in the same way it is inefficient trying to improve a program's speed without profiling it first.      This thesis proposes a new metric that exclusively measures convergence speed. We show that an algorithm can be profiled by correlating the performance as measured by multiple metrics. By combining these two techniques, we can obtain far better insight into how best to improve an algorithm. Using this information, we then propose a local convergence enhancement that greatly increases performance by actively estimating the location of an optimum.       The enhancement uses regression to fit a surface to the peak, guiding the search by estimating the peak's true location. By incorporating this technique, the algorithm is able to use the information contained within the fitness landscape far more effectively. We show that by combining the regression with an existing speciated algorithm, we are able to vastly improve the algorithm's performance. This technique will greatly enhance the utility of PSO on problems where fitness evaluations are expensive, or that require fast reaction to change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PSO</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Numerical Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Metrics</field><field name="subject">Regression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081027.122244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic potential of lichen-forming fungi in polyketide biosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Chooi, Yit Heng</field><field name="description">Lichens produce a diverse array of bioactive secondary metabolites, many of which are unique to the organisms. Their potential applications, however, are limited by their finite sources and the slow-growing nature of the organisms in both laboratory and environmental conditions. This thesis set out to investigate polyketide synthase genes in lichens, with the ultimate goal of providing a sustainable source of lichen natural products to support these applications.      To expand the diversity of PKS genes that could be detected in lichens, new degenerate primers targeting ketoacylsynthase (KS) domains of specific clades of PKS genes have been developed and tested on various lichen samples. Using these primers, 19 KS domains from various lichens were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the KS domains was used to infer the function of the PKS genes based on the predicted PKS domain architecture and chemical analysis by TLC and/or HPLC. KS domains from PKS clades not previously known in lichens were identified; this included the clade III NR (non-reducing)-PKSs, PR (partially reducing)-PKSs and HR (highly reducing)-PKSs. The discovery of clade III NR-PKSs with C-methyltransferase (CMeT) domain and their wide occurrence in lichens was especially significant.  Based on the KS domain phylogenetic analysis and compounds detected in the individual lichens, the clade III NR-PKSs were hypothesized to be involved in the biosynthesis of &#946;-orsellinic acid and methylphloroacetopheno ne - the monoaromatic precursors for many lichen coupled phenolic compounds, such as &#946;-orcinol depsides/depsidones and usnic acid.      A strategy has been developed to isolate clade III NR-PKSs directly from environmental lichen DNA using clade III NR-type KS amplified from the degenerate primers (NR3KS-F/R) as homologous probes. Another pair of degenerate primers specific to the CMeT domain of NR-PKSs has also been developed to facilitate the cloning and probing of new clade III NR-PKS genes in lichens. A clade III NR-PKS gene (xsepks1) from X. semiviridis was cloned successfully. This is the first report of the isolation of a full-length PKS gene from environmental lichen DNA. The domain architecture of xsepks1 is KS-AT-ACP-CMeT, as expected for a clade III NR-PKS, suggesting that the newly developed clade-specific primers are useful for cloning new clade III NR-PKS genes and that KS domain phylogenetic analysis can predict the functional domains in PKSs.      Attempts were made to characterize the function of xsepks1 by heterologous expression in Aspergillus species. Both A. nidulans (transformed with 5&#180;partial xsepks1 including native promoter) and A. oryzae (transformed with full-length xsepks1 under the regulation of starch-inducible amyB promoter) were tested as potential hosts for the expression of lichen PKS genes. Transcriptional analysis showed that A. nidulans could potentially utilize the lichen PKS gene promoter and both fungal hosts could splice the introns of a lichen PKS gene. Several compounds unique to the A. oryzae transformants carrying xsepks1 were detected, but they could not be reproduced in subsequent fermentations even though the gene was transcribed into mRNA. None of the expected products (&#946;-orsellinic acid, methylphloroacetophenone or similar methylated monoaromatic compounds) was detected in A. oryzae transformants, and the function of xsepks1 remains to be determined. The other clade III NR-PKS genes detected in X. semiviridis cou ld also be responsible for the biosynthesis of &#946;-orsellinic acid or methylphloroacetophenone, as precursors of the major secondary metabolites detected in X. semiviridis (i.e. fumarprotocetraric acid, succinprotocetraric acid and usnic acid).      Overall, the work in this thesis demonstrated the prospect of using a molecular approach to access the lichen biosynthetic potential without going through the cumbersome culturing stage.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">polyketide synthase genes</field><field name="subject">lichens</field><field name="subject">ketoacylsynthase</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081027.161315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing Australian Universities' Research Commercialisation</field><field name="creator">Collier, Alan James</field><field name="description">The Australian Government expects universities to engage in technology transfer and commercialisation (TT&amp;C) and almost all universities have established a technology transfer office (TTO) for this purpose.    The primary aim of this research was to identify what would enhance the overall performance of Australian universities in research commercialisation and industry uptake of the university research commercialisation outcomes. Four research questions were enunciated:    1 What are the systemic barriers to research commercialisation within Australian universities?    2 How could Australian universities overcome the systemic barriers to the commercialisation of university research?    3 How, in particular, could Australian smaller and regional universities enhance their research commercialisation capacity and performance?    4 How could the uptake by industry of Australian university research outcomes be improved?       Question 1 was answered using a qualitative content analysis on the substantial body of literature available.    Questions 2 and 3 were answered using multiple-case analysis involving eight Australian university case studies and comparing Australian university practice with five benchmark universities &#156; two from the US, two from Canada, and one from New Zealand.    The first major conclusion was that there are three essential criteria upon which university TT&amp;C success is built: institutional and senior executive support for TT&amp;C superior TTO management; and sufficient world-class research being conducted.    The second major conclusion was that the same key criteria for success in TT&amp;C apply across the board, whether a university is smaller, regional, technical, new or old, research-intensive or otherwise.    Question 4 was answered using case studies developed on five SME companies in the electronics industry in one Australian State and comparing these results with the outcome of a narrative review conducted on the literature to permit methodological triangulation. The research found a rich engagement occurring between universities and industry, with the most important element involving individual personal relationships.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Technology Transfer</field><field name="subject">Commercialisation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081027.163031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of stage-specific Fasciola proteases and their evaluation in vaccination trials</field><field name="creator">Jayaraj, Ramamoorthi</field><field name="description">The liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica cause infectious disease in ruminants and humans. The geographical range of these two parasite species (temperate and tropical respectively) ensures that infection can occur worldwide. Although anthelmintic treatment is effective against disease, emerging drug resistant strains leads to the development of a vaccine. However, despite several decades of research, there is no commercial vaccine available. The main challenge at present is to produce recombinant proteins in an immunologically active form using recombinant DNA technology. This is an essential step in Fasciola vaccine production.       Cysteine proteases are probably the most important facilitators of virulence in flukes and are produced by all stages of the fluke life-cycle. Two classes of cysteine protease are found in the excretory and secretory material of liver flukes- these are cathepsin L and cathepsin B. As such, the major aims of this thesis were to investigate the expression and purification of Fasciola recombinant cysteine proteins, and characterisation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. These studies demonstrate the production of functionally active cathepsin proteins in S. cerevisiae BJ3505 cells which will lead to vaccine candidate analysis.       The second aim of this thesis was to determine the protective efficacy of stage specific target antigens against experimental infection. In addressing this issue, the protective efficacy of single and multivalent recombinant protein vaccinations of adult stage F. hepatica cathepsin L5, immature F. gigantica cathepsin L1g and juvenile F. hepatica cathepsin B were analysed in Sprague Dawley rats against F. hepatica infection. This study demonstrates that juvenile fluke target antigen-cathepsin B induces better immune protection than adult fluke antigen-cathepsin L5.  Cocktails of juvenile and adult stage fluke recombinant proteins (cathepsin B and L5) elicited the highest protective immunity against experimental infection and this combination showed not only reduction in fluke recovery and size of flukes, but also marked diminution in the intensity of liver lesions in vaccinated rats.       In order to assess the immunogenic property of an early infective stage fluke secreting cysteine protease as a vaccine candidate, DNA vaccination vectors encoding cathepsin B were analysed in BALB/c mice. In this study, the ability of four DNA vaccination strategies such as secretory, chemokine-activating, lymph node targeting vectors encoding cathepsin B were assessed by antibody titre, antibody avidity, western blotting and ELIPSOT assay. The results have further validated the immunoprophylactic potential of a cathepsin B vaccine against F. hepatica.        In this study, we have expressed and attained high yields of F. gigantica cathepsin L1g from E. coli BL21, and compared this to a yeast-expressed system. This protease was over-expressed and formed insoluble inclusion bodies that were subsequently solubilised with urea or guanidine hydrochloride. In order to purify the urea-solubilised protein, step-wise urea gradient chromatography was used. For refolding of solubilised protein, a dilution and dialysis procedure was utilised. Proteolytic activity was confirmed by gelatin SDS-PAGE analysis.      In conclusion, the determination of the immune potential of recombinant stage specific antigens allows the development of effective vaccines against Fasciola infection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fasciola hepatica</field><field name="subject">cathepsin proteases</field><field name="subject">stage-specific vaccine candidates</field><field name="subject">DNA vaccines</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081029.100156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable management of stormwater using pervious pavements</field><field name="creator">Kadurupokune Wanniarachchi Kankanamge, Nilmini Prasadika</field><field name="description">Pervious pavements in car parks and driveways reduce peak discharge and the volume of runoff flowing in to urban drains and improve the water quality by trapping the sediments in the infiltrated water. This reduces the risk of pollutants such as suspended solids and particle bound chemicals such as phosphorous, nitrogen, heavy metals and oils and hydrocarbons entering receiving waters. The key objectives of the study are to establish relationships between rainfall and pervious pavement runoff and quantify improvements to infiltrated stormwater quality through the pervious pavement.    The field experimental results were used to calibrate the PCSWMMPP model and to develop water flow and quality improvement transfer functions of the MUSIC model for concrete block and turf cell pavements.    The research reported herein has demonstrated that pervious pavements can be introduced as a sustainable stormwater management initiative and as a key Water Sensitive Urban Design feature to deliver numerous benefits to the environment. The outcomes from the study will be useful in designing environmentally friendly car parks, pedestrian paths, light traffic drive ways, sporting grounds and public areas in the future.

A key aspect of this, Knapman argues, was concern over the dialectic of civilization and order as it related to the barbarian and the savage. The notion of the barbarian grounded the European nations in time and therefore constructing a sense of origin and particularism. Equally the savage and the barbarian placed non-European cultures in time. The thesis draws on a range of writers from eighteenth and nineteenth centuries such as Adam Smith, Edward Gibbon, David Hume, Thomas Malthus, John Stuart Mill, Charles Darwin, James Cowles Prichard, Robert Knox and many other lesser-known figures. This is   related to an examination of the nation in British representations of Southeast Asia, including colonial officials such as Stamford Raffles, John Crawfurd, and James Brooke who produced encyclopaedic accounts of their experiences in Asia. The thesis argues that while the complex grammar of the British Empire divided the world into spheres of civilisation and barbarism, it retained a special place for barbarians within the core and thus allowed for the naturalisation of nations within the context of an empire of civilizing others.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Empire</field><field name="subject">barbarian</field><field name="subject">savage</field><field name="subject">liberalism</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">nineteenth century ethnology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081029.123025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arranging and Orchestration methods:a model text for post secondary courses.</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Daryl</field><field name="description">Through the researcher's experience and informal discussions with other pedagogues working in tertiary music environments, the researcher was of the opinion that there is currently not a comprehensive arranging/orchestration method book that could be used exclusively as a course text in post-secondary arranging courses. While there are numerous published method books available, they are generally produced in North America and do not address all the needs of an arranging/orchestration course.    The aim of the research was to find what are the constituent parts and theoretical underpinnings of a model Arranging course text book. Also, to find what materials are currently being used by lecturers and teachers throughout Australasian universities, colleges and other institutions for the delivery of arranging (and/or orchestration) courses, and if these materials differ from those used in North America. Of interest are the assumptions made in the background knowledge of the students entering these courses from upper-secondary level or otherwise and if this project can assist students making the transition. Finally, is there potential to have a standard text published in Australia, what are the important elements that should be included, and is it possible to deliver such a text as an online document?   The research showed that most teachers and lecturers in post-secondary school music courses teaching arranging/orchestration use extracts from several books and link them together, filling in the gaps, with their own methodologies and experiences. The problem with this approach is the resultant lack of uniformity through the various sections of the course; in particular the musical examples used and the availability of audio recordings of the examples. Some older published texts, while valuable in their content, do not supply audio recordings. Most texts investigated that do supply audio recordings only demonstrate good arranging/orchestration techniques and fail to compare the same example conceived through poor technique.   This study revealed some important findings about the lack of a course method book existing that met the needs of educators delivering post-secondary courses in arranging. The key elements of such a course book were identified through research and then written into a model text (the project) with accompanying CD audio examples. Upon gaining valuable insights and completing the project, there was some scope for improving, extending (or changing delivery method) and publishing the project.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arranging</field><field name="subject">Orchestration</field><field name="subject">Pedagogy</field><field name="subject">Jazz Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081029.145347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chitosan and improved pigment ink jet printing on textiles</field><field name="creator">Momin, Nasar</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research was to explore two ways of the application of chitosan, a biopolymer, for ink jet printing of textiles. 1) To apply chitosan as a post-treatment on the fabric ink jet printed with pigment based inks for the fixation of pigments on the fabric. 2) To incorporate chitosan as a binder in pigment based ink jet ink formulations. The incorporation of chitosan was carried out in two ways. 1) Direct addition of chitosan into the ink formulations containing surface modified pigments. 2) Preparation of chitosan encapsulated pigment nanoparticles using complex coacervation technique and using these nanoparticles for the formulation of ink jet ink.        The degree of deacetylation (DD) was determined using FTIR spectroscopy. Various protocols proposed by researchers were used to determine the DD of chitosan samples used in the present study. The protocol proposed by Raut was found to be fairly accurate in determining the DD of chitosan samples. The molecular weight of chitosan was estimated using dilute solution viscometry method. The characterisation of the film forming ability of chitosan was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The colour strength (K/S), colour difference, colour characteristics and colour fastness to laundering and rubbing of ink jet printed fabrics post treated with chitosan were evaluated using standard methods.        Post-treatment (pad-dry-cure method) of cotton fabric ink jet printed with pigment based inks revealed that chitosan could effectively fix the pigments on cotton compared to the commercial textile binders and the water-soluble derivative of chitosan.         The chemical interaction between chitosan and cotton fabric was illustrated by FTIR-ATR analysis and through determination of carboxyl group content.        The ink jet printed cotton fabric post treated with 3gpl chitosan (MW 156,156) maintained almost 86% of bacterial reduction against Klebsiella Pneumoniae even after 50 launderings.            Inks containing chitosan were formulated and were found to be stable in terms of mean particle size and viscosity over a period of one month and for 4 freeze/thaw cycles. A magenta ink containing chitosan was selected for ink jet printing of cotton fabric. It was found that the DF was around 97% for magenta ink containing chitosan compared to around 53% fixation for magenta ink without chitosan on cotton fabric.         Surface modified carbon black pigment with carboxylated (COO-) surface functionality was selected to prepare chitosan encapsulated pigment nanoparticles by complex coacervation technique. Chitosan encapsulated pigment nanoparticles with mean particle size diameter of 876 nm and 742 nm were formed when 5 ml of 0.1% w/v pigment was mixed with 2ml and 3ml of 0.1% w/v chitosan, respectively. However, no correlation was found between the particle size of the nanoparticles formed and the concentration of chitosan. The DF with ink containing chitosan encapsulated pigment nanoparticles was found to be around 98% while the blank ink with only surface modified carbon black pigment showed 44% fixation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ink Jet printing</field><field name="subject">Textiles</field><field name="subject">Chitosan</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Surface modified pigments</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081029.154501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving Organisational Effectiveness with B2E E-business Model</field><field name="creator">Mootheril, Feeba</field><field name="description">This research is about understanding effectiveness achieved from B2E (Business-to-Employee) e-business model.

This research addressed the identified niche with a focus on the factors that lead to organisational effectiveness from B2E e-business model in the Australian context. The research was guided by Resourced Based Theory and Competing Values Framework to understand the impact of the model on organizational effectiveness. Research methods adopted for this research are exploratory; so that the 'new' area can be investigated and emerging new concepts in the same phenomena can be examined. Analysis of the data is interpretive, which was collected via interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The findings reveal that the Australian organisations investigated regard B2E e-business to be a dynamic and evolving model for internal management and servi ce to employees. The findings also indicate that B2E model is adopted differently in different organizations. However, the general pattern or theme that the data revealed is that the B2E applications tend to follow a stream of electronic applications such as electronic news (e-news), electronic documents (e-documents), electronic information (e-information), electronic human resource (e-HR) applications and electronic business processes for the management of employees and their internal processes.

These devices are based on the usage of solid oxide electrolytes operating at relatively elevated temperatures. Two major hurdles must be overcome in order to decrease the operating temperatures of practical SOFCs. The first relates to reducing ohmic losses within solid electrolytes. The second relates to the need for developing high performance electrodes since electrolyte reaction rates at both anode and cathode are affected detrimentally as operating temperatures fall.   This PhD project has focussed on addressing the first hurdle in two innovative ways:   1.	the implementation of solid electrolytes with higher ionic conductivity than zirconia,   2.	the development of very thin film electrolytes  as thick as 5&#131;&#221;m.   Several thin films with novel electrode-electrolyte structures were fabricated and evaluated in order to demonstrate the viability of low temperature SOFC operations. Development of such thin films was innovative and challenging to achieve.      The approach taken in this work involved fabricating a dense and thin gadolinia doped ceria (10GDC - Gd 10wt%, Ce 90wt%) oxide electrolyte. 10GDC is an electrolyte exhibiting higher conductivities than conventional materials during low temperature operations. A research contribution of this PhD was the demonstration of the deposition of 10GDC thin films using RF magnetron sputtering for the first time.   10GDC thin film electrolytes with thickness in a range between 0.1 to 5&#131;&#221;m were fabricated on 10 yttrium stabilised zirconium (10YSZ) substrates by using a RF magnetron sputterer. The primary parameters controlling 10GDC thin film deposition using this method were explored in order to identify optimal conditions.       The fabricated films were subsequently analysed for their morphology, composition and stoichiometry using a variety of methods, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry (EDS), optical microscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD).       A preliminary test was conducted in order to examine the function of 10GDC thin film electrolytes together with the cathode and anode substrates at intermediate temperatures (700oC). A complete planar single cell was designed and assembled for this purpose. However, when fully assembled and tested, the cell failed to generate any voltage or current. Consequently, the remainder of the PhD work was focused on systematically exploring the factors contributing to the assembled fuel cell failure. As fabrication failure analysis is seldom reported in the scientific literature, this analysis represents a significant scientific contribution.      This analysis proceeded in a series of steps that involved several different methods, including SEM, red dye analysis, surface morphology and cross section analysis of the cell. It was found that pinholes and cracks were present during the fuel cell operating test. Cathode delamination was also found to have occurred during the test operation.  This was determined to be due to thermal expansion mismatch between the cathode substrate and the 10GDC electrolyte thin film.      A series of suggestions for future research are presented in the conclusion of this work.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solid Oxide Fuel Cell</field><field name="subject">SOFC</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">RF sputtering</field><field name="subject">gadolinia doped ceria oxide</field><field name="subject">yttrium stabilised zirconium</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081030.110755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Executives' Decision Making in Australian Private Hospitals: Margin or Mission?</field><field name="creator">Sukkar, Malak</field><field name="description">This thesis examines decision making at executive level in Australian private hospitals as a social phenomenon, since individuals draw meaning from their own biographical and social environmental experiences.  The researcher interpreted the constructed realities of the factors influencing executives' decisions within the context of private hospitals - a field that is rarely examined through the lens of social research.       Using an Interpretivist research paradigm, the researcher conducted semi- structured and in-depth interviews with sixteen executive members who are experts in their field and represent both sectors of the private hospital industry: private for-profit and private not-for-profit.       The data generated was transformed into technical accounts using an abductive research strategy and adopting Sch&#252;tz's notion of first-order and second-order constructs.   Using Giddens' Structuration Theory, that stressed the fundamental role of the human agent, the structure and their mutual dependence, the researcher moved beyond the interpretation of individuals' meanings, to incorporate the structure as an entity that can be formed and reformed.      The researcher interpreted social actors' constructed meanings of these social phenomena in their work environment to form the elements of a two-dimensional decision making model at organisational level, incorporating the present with the future and the internal with the external factors.  On an individual level, three different approaches to decision making were identified, based on whether executives perceived the decision making phenomenon as intuition, as a reasoned process or as an expected outcome.      While being from a limited research sample, the findings of this study suggest that the paradox of mission / economic decisions restrained executives in the not-for-profit sector from strengthening their hospitals' financial performance, putting at risk, therefore, their ability to achieve social dividends as a way to proclaim their mission.  On the other hand, in the for-profit sector, shareholders' dividends appeared to be a strong catalyst for attaining profit maximisation when making decisions. In both settings, the findings suggest that the role of stakeholder theory is questionable, particularly when executives remained hesitant to involve medical specialists, whom they considered to be major stakeholders and profit generators for private hospitals.  This attitude appeared to be constant, despite the changes identified in executives' individual approaches to decision making.   However, early signs of shifts towards adopting more commercially and socially accountable decisions were apparent in not-for-p rofit and for-profit sectors respectively.      The thesis sets out recommendations to assist executives in managing the different factors that interplay to form executives' decisions. The importance of having a mission in business longevity and the integration, as opposed to alignment, of strategic goals with business operations when making executive decisions in private hospitals was highlighted.  The implications for both sectors are described and recommendations for further research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision making</field><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">strategic goals</field><field name="subject">private hospital</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">healthcare</field><field name="subject">mission</field><field name="subject">corporate</field><field name="subject">medical specialist</field><field name="subject">Structuration Theory</field><field name="subject">for-profit</field><field name="subject">not-for-profit</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081031.162754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accountants' acceptance of a cashless monetary system using an implantable chip</field><field name="creator">Young, Antony</field><field name="description">A logical control extension surrounding cashless means of exchange is a permanent personal verification mark.

My principal research question is: what is the advantage of including digital media as part of the designers' 'toolset' in the early stages of design? The context is a highly successful and high profile mid-sized Australian architectural practice. The study considers the nature of architectural designing as a creative activity and the extent to which advantages could be gained by including digital media as part of the designers' toolset in the early stages of design.      Designers seem to be polarised between championing the role of digital media as part of their design processes and downright rejecting it. One such extreme position is a view that this media has either 'no place' (Martens et al. 2007:np; Sanders 1996:4-5) within architectural design and is thus seen as 'just another tool' filling at best an ancillary and service role in the design process (Kvan, Mark et al. 2004:np). This view suggests therefore that designing with digital media has hardly advanced (Corrigan 2003:86). An opposing view is that digital media can take a more fundamental place to advance design methods (Rahim 2006:1), even revolutionarily improve the design process beyond 'question and debate' (Winner 1986:6 in Steele 2001:13), resulting in a 'new architecture' (Lindsey 2001:12) and encouraging significant change in designing through semi-automated generation of design and interconnected ways of communicating (Lindsey 2001:12).      Resulting from my study, I have found, however, that the more negative views (Winner 1986:6; Sanders 1996:4-5) regarding the integration of digital media into the architectural design process tend to distract from the more balanced investigation into how a designer masters an expanding architectural design practice.       As a doctoral candidate I take a participant-observer position within Terroir where I have been employed for the past five years. My experiences in responding to my research question suggest that the advantage of digital media is not a question of whether or not to integrate the tools. The question is more an issue of how a designer masters an expanding design process through an approach that includes ideas, conventional media and digital media. My thesis demonstrates the changes that occurred through the integration of digital media and, conversely, possibilities to opportunistically further improve on conventional design practice. My research suggests that mutuality exists in the relationship between the designer and their digital media. Through their co-evolution, changes can occur where there is not only an integration of digital media with design, but also both media and design practice change through their integration. I also discuss how an uptake of digital media gives grounds for a new specialised ro le in practice. A new role emerged within the collaborative firm of architects, which I have called in this thesis the digital ideator. It is a role that I demonstrate as potentially being central to digital media integrated with design practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">digital media</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">design process</field><field name="subject">ideation</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081126.155609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Fields to Factories: Prospects of Young Migrant Women in Vietnam's Garment and Footwear Industry</field><field name="creator">Bowen, Ruth</field><field name="description">The study explores the motivations and experiences of young single women migrating to work in the garment and footwear industries in Vietnam and the impact of migration on their lives and future prospects. The key issues investigated were the impact on the young women's working lives, their material and emotional well-being, agency and empowerment and personal life trajectories. Based on a questionnaire survey and interviews with young women factory workers in Hanoi, the research found that young women are motivated by the desire for a stable income and the lack of alternative employment options in rural areas, which are constrained by gendered patterns of vocational training and labour market opportunities. Migration into factory work brings young women increased incomes and opportunities for empowerment through a broadening of their horizons. As a result of migration young women gain confidence and increased capacity to achieve their personal life goals, and as  such, are empowered by the experience. Their marriage opportunities, however, are limited by factory employment and this places young women at odds with the expectations of their families and rural tradition. How women negotiate this divergence from traditional work and marriage expectations in Vietnam has mixed implications for young women's well-being and empowerment, and calls for a reconsideration of the nature of women's empowerment as represented in gender and development discourse.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081127.093004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pipeline Transport of Coarse Mineral Suspensions Displaying Shear Thickening</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Chryss</field><field name="description">Transport properties of concentrated suspensions are of interest to many industries. Mineral slurries at higher solids concentrations have shown some rheologically interesting characteristics such as shear thickening, the increase of viscosity of a multi-phase mixture with increasing shear rate.   The general literature on the rheology of suspensions records the presence of yield stresses, shear thinning and normal stress differences.  Little is said specifically about shear thickening behaviour except for colloidal suspensions.   The aim of this study is to examine the behaviour of coarse shear thickening suspensions and determine the causes of this phenomenon. The study intended to achieve the following objectives to;  develop the appropriate techniques for rheometric studies of shear thickening suspensions;  investigate the nature of particle-fluid interaction; develop a model of shear thickening  behaviour as it occurs in non-colloidal suspensions and to develop a method of applying the rheology results to flows and flow geometries of practical relevance.   The effects of wall slip dominate much of the literature of shear thickening materials.  To investigate this aspect a significant portion of the experimental work examined the effect of shear thickening on torsional flow.  The rheogram produced from parallel plate rheometry was reassessed as a non-controlled flow and a rheology model dependant analysis demonstrated that the effects of slip are considerably more problematic for shear thickening suspensions, particularly as wall slip is an increasing function of shear stress.     As a consequence of the rheometric method described above it was observed that the rate of change of the first normal stress difference, N1, with shear rate changes as shear thickening commences for non-colloidal suspensions.  N1 is initially negative and is increasingly negative at low shear rates.       Additional rheometric analysis examined the transient effects in the behaviour of a non-colloidal shear thickening suspension. By employing large angle oscillating strain tests the strain required to initiate a shear thickening response was determined.       Coherent back scattering of laser light experiments were able to show the change in orientation of the particles with respect to its rotation around the vorticity axis.   After a viscosity minimum was reached the orientation became more random as particle rotation and lamina disruption occurred.  This was considered to be the cause of the measured shear thickening.   A model of shear thickening in concentrated, non-colloidal suspensions of non-spherical particles was developed.  Based on hydrodynamic interaction in the Stokes flow regime, the flow of interstitial fluid subjected the adjacent particles to lubricating and Couette type forces, acting as a couple.    When a series of force balances on a particle contained between two moving laminae are conducted as a time sequence, the particle orientation and motion can be observed.   The model has qualitative agreement with several aspects of the experimentally observed behaviour of shear thickening suspensions, such as viscosity change with shear rate and concentration, and the first normal stress difference increasing with shear rate.     Pipe line flow experiments were conducted on the model suspension.  Particle settling produces unusual patterns in shear thickening suspensions, with an annulus of delayed settling near the wall.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mineral slurries</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">rheology of suspensions</field><field name="subject">coarse shear thickening</field><field name="subject">flow geometries</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081127.112225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective web crawlers</field><field name="creator">Ali, Halil</field><field name="description">Web crawlers are the component of a search engine that must traverse the Web, gathering documents in a local repository for indexing by a search engine so that they can be ranked by their relevance to user queries. Whenever data is replicated in an autonomously updated environment, there are issues with maintaining up-to-date copies of documents.      When documents are retrieved by a crawler and have subsequently been altered on the Web, the effect is an inconsistency in user search results. While the impact depends on the type and volume of change, many existing algorithms do not take the degree of change into consideration, instead using simple measures that consider any change as significant. Furthermore, many crawler evaluation metrics do not consider index freshness or the amount of impact that crawling algorithms have on user results. Most of the existing work makes assumptions about the change rate of documents on the Web, or relies on the availability of a long history of change.      Our work investigates approaches to improving index consistency: detecting meaningful change, measuring the impact of a crawl on collection freshness from a user perspective, developing a framework for evaluating crawler performance, determining the effectiveness of stateless crawl ordering schemes, and proposing and evaluating the effectiveness of a dynamic crawl approach. Our work is concerned specifically with cases where there is little or no past change statistics with which predictions can be made.      Our work analyses different measures of change and introduces a novel approach to measuring the impact of recrawl schemes on search engine users. Our schemes detect important changes that affect user results. Other well-known and widely used schemes have to retrieve around twice the data to achieve the same effectiveness as our schemes. Furthermore, while many studies have assumed that the Web changes according to a model, our experimental results are based on real web documents.      We analyse various stateless crawl ordering schemes that have no past change statistics with which to predict which documents will change, none of which, to our knowledge, has been tested to determine effectiveness in crawling changed documents. We empirically show that the effectiveness of these schemes depends on the topology and dynamics of the domain crawled and that no one static crawl ordering scheme can effectively maintain freshness, motivating our work on dynamic approaches.      We present our novel approach to maintaining freshness, which uses the anchor text linking documents to determine the likelihood of a document changing, based on statistics gathered during the current crawl. We show that this scheme is highly effective when combined with existing stateless schemes. When we combine our scheme with PageRank, our approach allows the crawler to improve both freshness and quality of a collection. Our scheme improves freshness regardless of which stateless scheme it is used in conjunction with, since it uses both positive and negative reinforcement to determine which document to retrieve.      Finally, we present the design and implementation of Lara, our own distributed crawler, which we used to develop our testbed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web Crawler</field><field name="subject">Search Engines</field><field name="subject">Index Consistency</field><field name="subject">Efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081127.164414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure and Private Fingerprint-based Authentication</field><field name="creator">Arakala, Arathi</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the requirements and processes involved in building an authentication system using the fingerprint biometric, where the fingerprint template is protected during storage and during comparison. The principles developed in this thesis can be easily extended to authentication systems using other biometric modalities.   Most existing biometric authentication systems store their template securely using an encryption function. However, in order to perform matching, the enrolled template must be decrypted. It is at this point that the authentication system is most vulnerable as the entire enrolled template is exposed. A biometric is irreplaceable if compromised and can also reveal sensitive information about an individual. If biometric systems are taken up widely, the template could also be used as an individual's digital identifier. Compromise in that case, violates an individual's right to privacy as their transactions in all systems where they used that compromised biometric can be tracked. Therefore securing a biometric template during comparison as well as storage in an authentication system is imperative.   Eight different fingerprint template representation techniques, where templates were treated as a set of elements derived from the locations and orientations of fingerprint minutiae, were studied. Four main steps to build any biometric based authentication system were identified and each of the eight fingerprint template representations was inducted through the four steps.   Two distinct Error Tolerant Cryptographic Constructs based on the set difference metric, were studied for their ability to securely store and compare each of the template types in an authentication system. The first construct was found to be unsuitable for a fundamental reason that would apply to all the template types considered in the research. The second construct did not have the limitation of the first and three algorithms to build authentication systems using the second construct were proposed.   It was determined that minutiae-based templates had significant intra sample variation as a result of which a very relaxed matching threshold had to be set in the authentication system. The relaxed threshold caused the authentication systems built using the first two algorithms to reveal enough information about the stored templates to render them insecure. It was found that in cases of such large intra-sample variation, a commonality based match decision was more appropriate.    One solution to building a secure authentication system using minutiae-based templates was demonstrated by the third algorithm which used a two stage matching process involving the second cryptographic construct and a commonality based similarity measure in the two stages respectively. This implementation was successful in securing the fingerprint template during comparison as well as storage, with minimal reduction in accuracy when compared to the matching performance without the cryptographic construct.   Another solution is to use an efficient commonality based error tolerant cryptographic construct. This thesis lists the desirable characteristics of such a construct as existence of any is unknown to date.   This thesis concludes by presenting good guidelines to evaluate the suitability of different cryptographic constructs to protect biometric templates of other modalities in an authentication system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biometric Security</field><field name="subject">Fingerprint Security</field><field name="subject">Minutiae-based templates</field><field name="subject">PinSketch</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.102017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Analysis of Film Blowing</field><field name="creator">Bennett, James Cameron</field><field name="description">Film blowing is a highly complex industrial process used to manufacture thin plastic films for uses in a wide range of applications; for example, plastic bags. The mathematical modelling of this process involves the analysis of highly nonlinear differential equations describing the complex phenomena arising in the film blowing process, and requires a sophisticated mathematical approach. This dissertation applies an innovative combination of tools, namely analytic, numerical and heuristic mathematical techniques to the analysis of the film blowing process.      The research undertaken examines, in particular, a two-point boundary value problem arising from the modelling of the radial profile of the polymer film. For even the simplest modelling of this process, namely the isothermal Newtonian model, the resulting differential equation is a highly nonlinear, second order one, with an extra degree of difficulty due to the presence of a small parameter multiplying the highest derivative. Thus, the problem falls into the category of a nonlinear singular perturbation problem.      Analytic techniques are applied to the isothermal Newtonian blown film model to obtain a closed form explicit approximation to the film bubble radius. This is then used as a base approximation for an iterative numerical scheme to obtain an improved numerical solution of the problem. The process is extended to include temperature variations, varying viscosity (Power law model) and viscoelastic effects (Maxwell model). As before, closed form approximations are constructed for these models which are used to launch numerical schemes, whose solutions display good accuracy. The results compare well with results obtained by purely numerical solutions in the literature.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singular Perturbations</field><field name="subject">Film Blowing</field><field name="subject">Asymptotic Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.115021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Structure Differences of Short Fragments and Amino Acids in Proteins with and without Disulfide Bonds</field><field name="creator">Dayalan, Saravanan</field><field name="description">Of the 20 standard amino acids, cysteines are the only amino acids that have a reactive sulphur atom, thus enabling two cysteines to form strong covalent bonds known as disulfide   bonds. Even though almost all proteins have cysteines, not all of them have disulfide bonds. Disulfide bonds provide structural stability to proteins and hence are an important constraint in determining the structure of a protein. As a result, disulfide bonds are used to study various protein properties, one of them being protein folding. Protein structure prediction is the problem of predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its one-dimensional amino acid sequence. Ab initio methods are a group of methods that attempt to solve this problem from first principles, using only basic physico-chemical properties of proteins. These methods use structure libraries of short amino acid fragments in the process of predicting the structure of a protein. The protein structures from which these structure libraries are created are not classified in any other way   apart from being non-redundant.      In this thesis, we investigate the structural dissimilarities of short amino acid fragments when occurring in proteins with disulfide bonds and when occurring in those proteins without   disulfide bonds. We are interested in this because, as mentioned earlier, the protein structures from which the structure libraries of ab initio methods are created, are not classified in any form. This means that any significant structural difference in amino acids and short fragments when occurring in proteins with and without disulfide bonds would remain unnoticed as these structure libraries have both fragments from proteins with disulfide bonds and without disulfide bonds together.      Our investigation of structural dissimilarities of amino acids and short fragments is done in four phases. In phase one, by statistically analysing the phi and psi backbone dihedral angle distributions we show that these fragments have   significantly different structures in terms of dihedral angles when occurring in proteins with and without disulfide bonds. In phase two, using directional statistics we investigate how structurally different are the 20 different amino acids and the short fragments when occurring in proteins with and without disulfide bonds. In phase three of our work, we investigate the differences in secondary structure preference of the 20 amino acids in proteins with and without disulfide   bonds. In phase four, we further investigate and show that there are significant differences within the same secondary   structure region of amino acids when they occur in proteins with and without disulfide bonds. Finally, we present the design and implementation details of a dihedral angle and secondary structure database of short amino acid fragments (DASSD) that is publicly available. Thus, in this thesis we show previously unknown significant structure differences in terms of backbone dihedral angles and secondary structures in amino acids and short fragments when they occur in proteins with and without disulfide bonds.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disulfide bonds</field><field name="subject">Structure dissimilarity</field><field name="subject">Protein structure prediction</field><field name="subject">Cysteines</field><field name="subject">Directional statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.122615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of land transport regulation in South Australia : the relevance of public choice theory</field><field name="creator">Radbone, Ian.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 349-363.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Transportation Law and legislation South Australia</field><field name="subject">Transportation South Australia History</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phr124.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6629210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unitised Regenerative Fuel Cells in Solar - Hydrogen Systems for Remote Area Power Supply</field><field name="creator">Doddathimmaiah, Arun Kumar</field><field name="description">Remote area power supply (RAPS) is a potential early market for renewable energy - hydrogen systems because of the relatively high costs of conventional energy sources in remote regions. Solar-hydrogen RAPS systems commonly employ photovoltaic panels, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser, a storage for hydrogen gas, and a PEM fuel cell. Unitised Regenerative Fuel Cells (URFCs) use the same hardware for both electrolyser and fuel cell functions. Since both of these functions are not required simultaneously in a solar hydrogen RAPS system, URFCs based on PEM technology provide a promising opportunity for reducing the cost of the hydrogen subsystem used in renewable-energy hydrogen systems for RAPS. URFCs also have potential applications in the areas of aerospace, submarines, energy storage for central grids, and hydrogen cars.        In this thesis, a general theoretical relationship between cell potential and current density of a single-cell PEM URFC operating in both fuel-cell (FC) and electrolyser (E) modes is developed using modified Butler-Volmer equations for both oxygen- and hydrogen-electrodes, and accounting for mass transport losses and saturation behaviour in both modes, membrane resistance to proton current, and membrane and electrode resistances to electron current. This theoretical relationship is used to construct a computer model based on Excel and Visual Basic to generate voltage-current (V-I) polarisation curves in both E and FC modes for URFCs with a range of membrane electrode assembly characteristics. The model is used to investigate the influence on polarisation curves of varying key parameters such charge transfer coefficients, exchange current densities, saturation currents, and membrane conductivity.  A method for using the model to obtain best-fit values for electrode characteristics corresponding to an experime ntally-measured polarisation curve of a URFC is presented.       The experimental component of the thesis has involved the design and construction of single PEM URFCs with an active area of 5 cm2 with a number of different catalyst types and loadings. V-I curves for all these cells have been measured and the performance of the cells compared. The computer model has then been used to obtain best-fit values for the electrode characteristics for the URFCs with single catalyst materials active in each mode on each electrode for the corresponding experimentally-measured V-I curves. Generally values have been found for exchange current densities, charge transfer coefficients, and saturation current densities that give a close fit between the empirical and theoretically-generated curves. The values found conform well to expectations based on the catalyst loadings, in partial confirmation of the validity of the modelling approach. The model thus promises to be a useful tool in identifying electrodes with materials and structures, together with optimal catalyst types and loadings  that will improve URFC performance.       Finally the role URFCs can play in developing cost-competitive solar- hydrogen RAPS systems is discussed, and some future directions for future URFC research and development are identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote area power supply</field><field name="subject">solar hydrogen</field><field name="subject">proton exchange membrane</field><field name="subject">unitised regenerative fuel cells</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.140252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The optimisation of a method for total selenium analysis and application to cereal grain foods</field><field name="creator">Elis, [forename not supplied]</field><field name="description">Cereal based foods, including breakfast cereals and Asian noodles are potentially good sources of selenium. Although these are major foods consumed globally, their contribution to dietary intakes of selenium is unclear. In addition, there has been very limited research into the effect of processing steps on the analysis and apparent retention of selenium. The low levels typically present in foods and the presence of multiple chemical forms of the element provide significant analytical challenges to research in this area. Therefore, the aims of this study were firstly to evaluate and validate procedures for extraction and measurement of selenium in wheat flour. Secondly, the procedure has been applied to analysis of selenium in cereal foods. The methods employed were firstly validated using wheat-based reference materials and then samples of various breakfast cereals as well as different styles of Asian noodles were analysed. Selenium was extracted using closed- v essels by microwave digestion with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide, followed by determination through Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The optimum conditions for selenium determination in cereal based foods involved the digestion of 0.1 g samples using 1 mL of nitric acid and 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide. The addition of 1% (v/v) methanol was found to enhance the sensitivity of the ICP-MS system. Two particular isotopes of selenium (77 and 82) could be effectively employed in the analysis and there was no significant decrease in total selenium in the digested extracts during storage for up to twelve days under refrigeration and room temperature conditions. Good precision levels were obtained and the total selenium levels in the breakfast cereal samples ranged from 0.059 to 0.378 &#181;g/g. For white salted noodles the values varied between 0.057 and 0.712 &#181;g/g, for yellow alkaline noodles, 0.109 to 0.265 &#181;g/g and 0.077 to 0.284 &#181;g/g for fried instant noodles. There was no appar ent change observed in total selenium during the processing of fried instant noodles, indicating the effectiveness of the extraction method developed here. It is concluded that microwave digestion is an effective approach to sample extraction, the procedures validated in this study are suitable for cereal grain foods and that there is considerable variation in the selenium contents of breakfast cereal and Asian noodle products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cereal grain foods</field><field name="subject">ICP-MS</field><field name="subject">selenium</field><field name="subject">microwave digestion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.143142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modern Islamic Terrorism, Jihad and the Perceptions of Melbourne's Muslim Leaders</field><field name="creator">Elzain, Carol</field><field name="description">Terrorism has loomed in the public eye for centuries; however, since 9/11 modern terrorism has attracted a new public dimension. On an international and domestic scope, media and government bodies have identified that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were delivered by the hands of Islamic terrorists, namely Al-Qaeda   (U.S. Government, 2002). According to Australian, American and British government official reports and numerous international and domestic media reports, Al-Qaeda publicly claimed responsibility for 9/11 and other terrorist attacks such as the Bali, London and Madrid bombings (Al-Jazeera, 2004: 1-6; Gonzales, 2006:3; National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, 2002: 1-49; ). Furthermore, some domestic and international Muslim communities have responded to 9/11 and other attacks by revealing their support of Al-Qaeda's hatred and violence  towards the West  (Tarakhil, 2004:1; Ziabi, 2006:5).  It was here among these media and governmen t reports that the concept of Jihad emerged as a pivotal religious and political concept that justifies terrorism. As a result, Jihad developed a causal link to terrorism and thus, placed Islam in the forefront of controversy as a religion that creates terrorists.   Despite such compelling government and media reports on the association made between Jihad and terrorism, questions as to their link remain prevalent. It would be an ignorant and a deeply unjust assumption to make against Islam, if the public are led to believe that an association truly exists between Jihad and terrorism without credibly assessing the construct and application of both concepts. Therefore, it is the aim of this research to analyze Jihad and terrorism first as singular concepts, and then examine the possible link that Jihad may have with Islamic terrorism. In order to successfully conduct such an enquiry, it is important to compare and contrast both the interpretations of Melbourne's Islamic religious leaders to that of academic literature on Jihad and terrorism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Terrorism</field><field name="subject">Jihad</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.145202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Laundry Detergents and Residual Alkali    on the   Light Fastness of Reactive Dyes on 100% Cotton</field><field name="creator">Fergusson, Stanley MacArthur</field><field name="description">This study presents findings on the effect of domestic laundry detergents on the fastness to light of selected fibre reactive dyes applied to cotton.  The study was carried out to elucidate the reasons for the accelerated colour loss of cotton garments washed under Australian domestic laundering conditions.   Cotton fabric dyed with commonly used reactive dyes were laundered with water only, several  domestic detergents and a laboratory formulated neutral detergent, and then exposed  to light for two hours in the wet state.  Quantities of detergent used were in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations.  Exposures were repeated fifteen times equivalent to 30 hours exposure.  Colour loss and colour difference were measured after 5, 10 and 15 wash cycles and 10, 20 and 30 hours exposure.   When the fabric was exposed wet the colour faded more rapidly than when exposed dry to light.  Detergents increased the colour loss even when the fabric was not exposed to light.  The presence of an oxidizing bleach (sodium perborate) in the detergent increased colour loss during washing and wet exposure to light.  Ultraviolet radiation from the light source, heat, moisture, alkali and oxidising bleach during exposure resulted in hydrolysis of the dye-fibre bond causing dye desorption during washing and rinsing.  Water alone increased the fading of the dyes most likely due to presence of dissolved oxygen held within the fibre.  The combination of ultraviolet radiation and oxidizing bleaches altered the chemistry of the dye and hence its shade. This was particularly evident on the black dye and one of the navy blue dyes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reactive dyes</field><field name="subject">laundry detergents</field><field name="subject">oxidising bleaches</field><field name="subject">ultraviolet light</field><field name="subject">exposure</field><field name="subject">wet fading</field><field name="subject">colour loss</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081128.162252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Persistent Organic Pollutants in Australian Sewage Sludge: Environmental Monitoring and Land Application Risk Assessment</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Bradley</field><field name="description">Presented is a study of persistent organic pollutants in Australian sewage sludge, focusing on environmental monitoring and a sewage sludge land application human health risk contaminated with these compounds.

Intimate Partner Abuse (IPA) may be defined as a pattern of deliberate physical, sexual, or psychological abuse within a married, de-facto, dating, or courting relationship (Miller &amp; Bukva, 2001: Victoria Health Promotion Foundation, 2004). Specifically, Study One aimed to explore the IPA attitudes of Australian students and examine the relationships between these attitudes with a view to provide theoretical guidance for understanding how negative IPA attitudes may be maintained. A total of 400 students (male = 99, female = 301) with ages ranging from 15 to 25 years (M = 19.38, SD = 2.04) participated in Study One. Participants completed the Conflict Tactics Scale - Revised (CTS2; Straus, Hamby, Boney-McCoy, &amp; Surgarman, 1996), which measures the number of times respondents have experienced physic al and psychological abuse over the previous 12-month period. Attitudinal questionnaires were also completed by participants, including a measure of IPA victim blame and endorsement of IPA myths. Overall, rates of IPA among the present sample were consistent with those reported in overseas samples, with over 85% of women reporting being the victim of psychological abuse in the previous 12-months, and over 30% having been the victim of physical abuse. Lower scores on measures of victim blaming attitudes were associated with more positive attitudes towards women and less endorsement of IPA myths. These findings implicate the importance of addressing attitudes towards women and commonly held IPA myths within IPA prevention programs for young people.    Study Two evaluated a brief educational program for Australian Technical And Further Education (TAFE) and high school students, which was selected and modified on the basis of a literature review of published program evaluations and the findings of Study One of this thesis. The program, titled Through New Eyes: Exploring the Hidden Dynamics of Domestic Violence (Hunter Women's Centre, 2003), aimed to inform the IPA attitudes of students and comprised of videos and discussion questions. A quasi-experimental pre-post design was used with a non-randomised experimental and control group. The program was evaluated using a questionnaire measure of participants' attitudes as well as their experience of the program. There were 98 students who consented to participate in Study Two, 48 (male = 26, female = 22) of whom fulfilled all the requirements of participation and were included in the results of the study. Participants' ages ranged from 14 to 25 years (M = 16.91, SD = 2.12). Several statistically significant desi rable changes were observed among participants of the program, however there were similar changes observed among control group participants. Study Two provides some support for the effectiveness of the Through New Eyes program in informing the attitudes of young Australians. However, it is recommended that future research evaluate this program in combination with skill building programs in order to assist students to translate attitudinal changes into behavioural ones.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intimate partner abuse</field><field name="subject">dating violence</field><field name="subject">primary prevention</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081202.120823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technical Risk Manager TRManager</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Mark</field><field name="description">Successful projects may be defined by criteria set prior to a project being commenced.

FPGAs blur the traditional distinction between hardware and software and offer the promise of application specific hardware acceleration. But realizing this in a general sense requires a significant departure from traditional embedded systems development flows. Whereas off-the-shelf processors have a fixed architecture, the same cannot be said of purpose-built FPGA-based processors.  With this freedom comes the challenge of empirically determining the optimal boundary point between hardware and software.  The fluidity of the hardware/software partition also poses an interesting challenge for compiler developers.      This thesis presents a tool and methodology that addresses these codesign challenges in a new way. Described as 'compiler-directed codesign', it makes use of a suitably modified compiler to help direct the development of a custom processor core on a per-application basis.      By exposing the compiler's internal representation of a compiled target program, visibility into those instructions, and hardware resources, that are most sought after by the compiler can be gained.  This information is then used to inform further processor development and to determine the optimal partition between hardware and software.  At each design iteration, the machine model is updated to reflect the available hardware resources, the compiler is rebuilt, and the target application is compiled once again. By including the compiler 'in-the-loop' of custom processor design, developers can accurately quantify the impact on performance caused by the addition or removal of specific hardware resources and iteratively converge on an optimal solution.      Compiler Directed Codesign has advantages over existing codesign methodologies because it offers both a concrete point from which to begin the partitioning process as well as providing quantifiable and rapid feedback of the merits of different partitioning choices. When applied to an Adaptive PCM Encoder/Decoder case study, the Compiler Directed Codesign technique yielded a custom processor core that was between 36% and 73% smaller, consumed between 11% to 19% less memory, and performed up to 10X faster than comparable general-purpose FPGA-based processor cores.      The conclusion of this work is that a suitably modified compiler can serve a valuable role in directing hardware/software partitioning on a per-application basis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Compiler Directed Codesign</field><field name="subject">Hardware / Software Codesign</field><field name="subject">Embedded Systems</field><field name="subject">Codesign</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Custom Processor Design</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081202.141333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implications of knowledge management for library and information science education: a mixed method investigation</field><field name="creator">Hazeri Baghdadabad, Afsaneh</field><field name="description">Knowledge Management (KM) is a popular topic emerging from the business sector, which has influenced many fields of study, among them Library and Information Science (LIS). As KM is quite recent, there is still much ambiguity as to its nature and its place in LIS education.        The current study sought to shed a light on these issues. To help achieve better understanding of KM and its implications for LIS education, the researcher employed a mixed method approach, using both a web-based survey of LIS professionals and in-depth interviews with 18 LIS Heads of schools or senior staff at schools operating KM programs and courses.      The research indicates that although to an extent, confusion remains over the nature of KM and its relevance to LIS, there is at least recognition among the research community of the need for a proper understanding of knowledge management, as distinct from information management and of the importance of looking at KM from a generalist perspective. The findings further indicate that the LIS community is seeking to expand its boundaries into a wider professional environment than that of traditional librarianship, and that it sees KM as an effective vehicle for this purpose. The indications are also that apart from at the elective level, KM education should be offered not just as a distinct and separate track, but also as a subject pervading the entire LIS curriculum. The findings also highlight a need for greater integration between research and teaching in knowledge management, and for improved links between the curriculum and the outside world of KM practice.  This implies the need for LIS schools to import  aspects of KM practice into their activities. Participants also acknowledged the importance of matching KM education both to the needs of students and of the marketplace.       Furthermore, the research results highlight the necessarily multidisciplinary character of KM curricula, with the need for LIS curricula to focus on tacit knowledge and the human dimension of KM, as well as on business, management and organisational issues. The findings also support a collaborative approach to KM education in order to achieve the creation of a holistic curriculum, with contributions particularly, from business schools, industry and practitioners.       Based on the findings of this study, a partial or improper understanding of KM among the LIS community, and a lack of realisation of the value of KM education among LIS students and educators, are key issues facing KM education in the LIS sector. To solve these problems, LIS schools not only need to provide courses in knowledge management, and promote it among the LIS community, but also they must actively market the concept and their own contribution to the field.      This thesis makes an innovative contribution to the literature of KM education, and to the understanding of the subject and its related concepts. It is also one of the few such pieces of research into the implications of KM for LIS education to have been conducted on a global basis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Library and Information Science (LIS)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081202.143759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local NGOs in national development:   The case of East Timor</field><field name="creator">Hunt, Janet</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the roles and experiences of local East Timorese non-government organisations through the multiple transitions which accompanied East Timor's process of independence in the period 1999-2004.  It explores how NGOs attempted to influence the changing environment in which they were operating, particularly in the development of the new nation.  In doing so, it examines how the actual experience of these local NGOs relates to theories of civil society and NGOs in the various phases of transition to democracy, state and nation building and post-conflict peacebuilding.      After reviewing literature relating to the role of civil society and NGOs in democratisation, development and peacebuilding, and identifying some key issues to explore, the study turns to the particular context of East Timor. It summarizes the colonial history, with a particular focus on governance, development and the emergence of civil society and NGOs in that territory, and the phases of the transition. It then focuses closely on six leading East Timorese NGOs, which between them reflect different organisational origins and sectoral interests and which were perceived to be playing significant roles within the NGO community.      The case study chapters describe briefly the history of each NGO, then trace their stories over an approximately five year period. They explore how the visions, strategies, programs and organisational systems of these NGOs changed as the context changed. The case studies show how adaptive these NGOs were, how excluded some of them were by the huge influx of international players after the ballot, but how, in the absence of a legitimate government, they were included in various processes in a number of important ways during the UNTAET period. These studies also reveal some of the challenges the NGOs faced as the new government took over in May 2002.      The study concludes by summarising the changing roles and capacities of the NGOs, highlighting the many roles which local NGOs played throughout the study period, and the way in which they met new demands placed upon them. It identifies capacities critical for these NGOs' survival and development, and identifies some strategies which the NGOs themselves identified as useful in helping them attain these. It also identifies some areas which they found challenging and where more capacity development may have been valuable.      Finally the study reflects on the actual experiences of Timorese NGOs compared to theory and experiences elsewhere relating to democracy, development and peacebuilding.   The findings, which emphasise the changing relationship of the new state to its citizens, suggest that the civil society and development practice, which has been strongly based on de Tocqueville's approach to civil society, is not particularly helpful in a post-conflict setting. Instead, an adapted Gramscian approach, viewing civil and political society as interrelated sites in which a struggle to embed non-violent means of apportioning power are being waged, could be of greater analytic and practical value.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-government organisations</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">post-conflict</field><field name="subject">international development</field><field name="subject">transitional countries</field><field name="subject">democratisation</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081202.155254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of Fluid Dynamics and Particle Transport in a Realistic Human Nasal Cavity</field><field name="creator">Inthavong, Kiao</field><field name="description">Airflow and particle transport through the nasal cavity was studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A computational model of the human nasal cavity was reconstructed through CT scans. The process involved defining the airway outline through points in space that had to be fitted with a closed surface. The airflow was first simulated and detailed airflow structures such as local vortices, wall shear stresses, pressure drop and flow distribution were obtained. In terms of heat transfer the differences in the width of the airway especially in the frontal regions was found to be critical as the temperature difference was greatest and therefore heating of the air is expedited when the air is surrounded by the hotter walls. Understanding the effects of the airway geometry on the airflow patterns allows better predictions of particle transport through the airway.      Inhalation of foreign particles is filtered by the nasal cilia to some degree as a defence mechanism of the airway. Particles such as asbestos fibres, pollen and diesel fumes can be considered as toxic and lead to health problems. These particles were introduced and the effects of particle morphology were considered by customising the particle trajectory equation. This mainly included the effects of the drag correlation and its shape factor. Local particle deposition sites, detailed deposition efficiencies and particle trajectories were obtained. High inertial particles tended to be filtered within the anterior regions of the cavity due to a change in direction of the airway as the air flow changes from vertical at the inlet to horizontal within the main nasal passage.      Inhaled particles with pharmacological agents are often deliberately introduced into the nasal airway with a target delivery. The mucous lined airway that is highly vascular provides an avenue for drug delivery into the blood stream. An initial nasal spray experiment was performed to determine the parameters that were important for nasal spray drug delivery. The important parameters were determined to be the spray angle, initial particle velocity and particle swirl. It was found that particles were formed at a break-up length at a cone diameter greater than the spray nozzle diameter. The swirl fraction determined how much of the velocity magnitude went into a tangential component. By combining a swirling component along with a narrow spray into the main streamlines, greater penetration of larger particles into the nasal cavity may be possible. These parameters were then used as the boundary conditions for a parametric study into sprayed particle drug delivery within the CFD domain. The results were aimed to  assist in the design of more efficient nasal sprays.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nasal cavity</field><field name="subject">cfd</field><field name="subject">airway</field><field name="subject">airflow patterns</field><field name="subject">fibre</field><field name="subject">particle deposition</field><field name="subject">nasal spray</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081202.162555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rotationally Invariant Techniques for Handling Parameter Interactions in Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization</field><field name="creator">Iorio, Antony William</field><field name="description">In traditional optimization approaches the interaction of parameters associated with a problem is not a significant issue, but in the domain of Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization (EMOO) traditional genetic algorithm approaches have difficulties in optimizing problems with parameter interactions. Parameter interactions can be introduced when the search space is rotated. Genetic algorithms are referred to as being not rotationally invariant because their behavior changes depending on the orientation of the search space. Many empirical studies in single and multi-objective evolutionary optimization are done with respect to test problems which do not have parameter interactions. Such studies provide a favorably biased indication of genetic algorithm performance. This motivates the first aspect of our work; the improvement of the testing of EMOO algorithms with respect to the aforementioned difficulties that genetic algorithms experience in the presence of para meter interactions.      To this end, we examine how EMOO algorithms can be assessed when problems are subject to an arbitrarily uniform degree of parameter interactions. We establish a theoretical basis for parameter interactions and how they can be measured. Furthermore, we ask the question of what difficulties a multi-objective genetic algorithm experiences on optimization problems exhibiting parameter interactions. We also ask how these difficulties can be overcome in order to efficiently find the Pareto-optimal front on such problems. Existing multi-objective test problems in the literature typically introduce parameter interactions by altering the fitness landscape, which is undesirable. We propose a new suite of test problems that exhibit parameter interactions through a rotation of the decision space, without altering the fitness landscape. In addition, we compare the performance of a number of recombination operators on these test problems.      The second aspect of this work is concerned with developing an efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm which works well on problems with parameter interactions. We investigate how an evolutionary algorithm can be made more efficient on multi-objective problems with parameter interactions by developing four novel rotationally invariant differential evolution approaches. We also ask  whether the proposed approaches are competitive in comparison with a state-of-the-art EMOO algorithm.      We propose several differential evolution approaches incorporating directional information from the multi-objective search space in order to accelerate and direct the search. Experimental results indicate that dramatic improvements in efficiency can be achieved by directing the search towards points which are more dominant and more diverse. We also address the important issue of diversity loss in rotationally invariant vector-wise differential evolution. Being able to generate diverse solutions is critically important in order to avoid stagnation. In order to address this issue, one of the directed approaches that we examine incorporates a novel sampling scheme around better individuals in the search space. This variant is able to perform exceptionally well on the test problems with much less computational cost and scales to very high decision space dimensions even in the presence of parameter interactions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-Objective Optimization</field><field name="subject">Differential Evolution</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Parameter Interactions</field><field name="subject">Optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081203.100151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baking enzymes and microencapsulation strategies for retardation of staling</field><field name="creator">Kaur, Harkirat</field><field name="description">The staling of baked products remains a significant cause of economic loss due to the loss of enjoyment seen as crumb firming occurs. The aims of the current project have been to investigate the stability of amylases in bakery formulations. In addition, the impact of partial hydrolysis products of starch on staling is investigated. Specific assays were used to measure &#131;&#209;-amylase and &#131;&#210;-amylase, in the presence of the other potentially interfering activity. &#131;&#209;-Amylase activity levels appeared to gradually increase during the proofing stages and then to decline upon heating of the dough. However, the activity remaining in the final baked loaf was readily measurable indicating that not all of the enzyme had been inactivated. Free and total &#131;&#210;-amylase activities were also measured and most was found to be in the free form. &#131;&#210;-Amylase was unstable with only relatively low activities remaining in the final baked loaf. It appears that of the two amylolytic enzymes, &#131;&#209;-a mylase is sufficiently stable that it may exert some impact on the crumb characteristics in the freshly baked product and during subsequent storage. In order to assess the likelihood that amylolysis is of significance to crumb characteristics, HPLC was used to analyse aqueous extracts for sugars. Commercial flours were found to contain low levels of sugars with maltose being the predominant sugar present. A number of commercial breads were also analysed and the composition found to vary between the different samples. Typically maltose was present at higher levels than the other sugars. When experimental loaves were analysed, the patterns showed that other sugars declined during proofing whereas maltose remained at readily measurable levels. Upon baking and subsequent storage the amounts of maltose increased. These results are consistent with the findings that some amylolytic activity remains in the baked product. In the third phase of this study, a potential means of investigating the role of particular carb ohydrates in product textures and staling rates was examined. The approach of spray drying was used to prepare microencapsulated maltodextrin. The encapsulating agents used were based upon rice starch and guar galactomannan. When these microcapsules were incorporated into the breadmaking formulation and baked, it appeared that softer crumb characteristics were achieved. The data also indicates an effect of delay in the staling rates. In a preliminary evaluation of the potential of two X-ray scattering methods, it was found that both techniques appear useful. The differences seen for samples of bread crumb analysed at various stages of storage did not show large differences in the intensity patterns. Of the two approaches, small angle analysis (SAXS) appears to show greater potential for application in ongoing studies of staling. In conclusion, cereal grain &#131;&#209;-amylase may be more stable during breadmaking than previously thought. There appears to be an increase in the level of some low molecular weight sugars  in the final, baked product. Microencapsulation may offer a useful technique for the study of the role of specific carbohydrates during baking and storage of breads.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amylases</field><field name="subject">Breadmaking</field><field name="subject">Maltodextrin</field><field name="subject">Microencapsulation</field><field name="subject">Staling</field><field name="subject">X-ray scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081203.133339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal use of rainwater tanks to minimize residential water consumption</field><field name="creator">Khastagir, Anirban</field><field name="description">Melbourne, the capital of Victoria Australia leads the world in having the highest quality drinking water. The Victorian State Government has set targets for reducing per capita water consumption by 15%, 25% and 30% by 2010, 2015 and 2020 respectively and has announced stringent water restrictions to curtail water demand. In this resource constraint environment it is opportune to look for alternative sources of water to supplement Melbourne's traditional water supply.    In Melbourne, legislation has been changed to make it possible to use rainwater harvested from domestic tanks for non potable purposes. The annual rainfall in Melbourne's metropolitan area varies from 450mm in the West to 850mm in the East to over 1000mm in the North East mountain ranges. The objectives of the current study are to develop a methodology to estimate the optimal size of the rainwater tank at a particular location considering the local rainfall, roof area, demand for water and the reliability of supply (supply security) required; to quantify the rainwater volume that could be harvested at site using domestic rainwater tanks to minimise pressure on the potable water supply secured from traditional catchment sources until the desalination plant is commissioned in 2013; to  analyse the efficacy of rainwater tanks to reduce the stormwater runoff and improve the quality of the stormwater that will otherwise flow into urban drains and to estimate the cost effectiveness ratio and payback period of inst alling rainwater tanks.   A simple water balance model was developed to calculate the tank size based on daily rainfall, roof area and the expected demand. The concept of 'reliability' was introduced to measure supply security. Rainfall data from 20 rainfall stations scattered around Melbourne were used to determine the variation in the rainwater tank size dependent on the above stated parameters. It was observed that to achieve the same supply reliability (90%) and to meet a specific demand (toilet and garden use), the tank size required in the western side of Melbourne is as high as 7 times as that required in the north-east side.

This thesis explores the potential of elastomers in what is a distinctly multidisciplinary field. The focus is on developing innovative fabrication solutions for planar photonic devices and for nanoscale devices in general. Innovations are derived from treatments of master structures, imprintable substrates and device applications.   	Major contributions made by this work include fully replicated planar integrated optical devices, nanoscale applications for photolithographic standing wave corrugations (SWC), and a biologically templated, optical fiber based, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor. The planar devices take the form of dielectric rib waveguides which for the first time, have been integrated with long-period gratings by replication. The heretofore unemployed SWC is used to demonstrate two innovations. The first is a novel demonstration of elastomeric sidewall photolithographic mask, which exploits the capacity of elastomers to cast undercut structures. The second demonstrates that the corrugations themselves in the absence of elastomers, can be employed as shadow masks in a directional flux to produce vertical stacks of straight lines and circles of nanowires and nanoribbons. The thesis then closes by conceptually combining the preceding demonstrations of waveguides and nanostructures. An optical fiber endface is em ployed for the first time as a substrate for patterning by replication, wherein the pattern is a nanostructure derived from a biological template. This replicated nanostructure is used to impart a SERS capability to the optical fiber, demonstrating an ultra-sensitive, integrated photonic device realized at great economy of both time and money, with very real potential for mass fabrication.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanofabrication</field><field name="subject">nanoimprint lithography</field><field name="subject">nanowire</field><field name="subject">nanoring</field><field name="subject">photolithography</field><field name="subject">standing wave corrugations</field><field name="subject">surface-enhanced Raman scattering</field><field name="subject">optical fibre</field><field name="subject">waveguide</field><field name="subject">grating</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081203.161726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Skill acquisition in parents with an intellectual disability: The effectiveness of in-home behavioural parent training</field><field name="creator">Mildon, Robyn Louise</field><field name="description">Little research has been conducted focusing on parent training strategies aimed at teaching parents with an intellectual disability to implement strategies to decrease their child's problem behaviour and increase appropriate behaviours.  This study aimed to do two things.  First, to examine the effectiveness of an enhanced assessment-based BPT intervention that was implemented by parents with an intellectual disability with children with problem behaviour.  Second, the current study also aimed to test the effectiveness of the parent training package used to teach parents to implement the intervention strategies. Importantly, in an attempt to identify the training condition, or combination of conditions, most needed to achieve behaviour change, individual conditions of a multi-condition parent training package were additively introduced during parent training based on the degree of intrusiveness in the target routine combined with the amount of structure required  by the teaching strategy. Five parents were taught to implement a functional assessment driven intervention plan aimed at increasing their child's appropriate behaviour and decreasing their problem behaviour during a valued family routine.  In order to establish the combination of parent training strategies that were sufficient to teach parents to effectively implement the intervention plan, a series of parent training strategies were introduced in a planned way.  The strategies included role-play, verbal instruction, verbal instruction plus feedback, coaching and video-feedback.  Results showed that for all parents skill acquisition did not occur until the final phase, video-feedback.  Successful implementation of the intervention resulted in a corresponding increase in child appropriate behaviour and decrease in child problem behaviour.  In addition to that, parents rated the social validity and contextual fit of the intervention highly.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parent training</field><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">intellectually disabled</field><field name="subject">problem behaviour</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081204.100958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, structures and reactions of new cyclometallated dinuclear gold complexes containing the fluorine-substituted ligands.</field><field name="creator">Mirzadeh, Nedaossadat</field><field name="description">The dinuclear cyclometallated gold(I) complex [Au2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] was prepared in high yield from the reaction of 2-LiC6F4PPh2 with either [AuBr(AsPh3)] or [AuCl(tht)], and from the reaction of 2-Me3SnC6F4PPh2 with [AuCl(tht)].       The digold(I) complex undergoes oxidative addition reactions with halogens to give the metal-metal bonded dihalodigold(II) complexes [Au2IIX2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] (X = Cl, Br, I), which on warming or exposure to light, isomerise to give the heterovalent gold(I)-gold(III) species [XAu(&#181;-2-C6F4PPh2)(&#954;2-2-C6F4PPh2)AuX] containing a four-membered cyclometallated ring on a gold(III) centre. Unlike its protio analogue, [Au2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] did not undergo oxidative addition of methyl iodide or dibenzoyl peroxide.      The dihalodigold(II) [Au2IIX2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] and gold(I)-gold(III) compounds [XAu(&#181;-2-C6F4PPh2)(&#954;2-2-C6F4PPh2)AuX] (X = Cl, Br) are further oxidised by halogens to give the digold(III) species [Au2X4(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] and [X3Au(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)(&#954;2-2-C6F4PPh2)AuX], respectively. The complexes [Au2X4(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] are reduced to the dihalodigold(II) complexes in the presence of one equivalent of zinc powder; further addition of zinc gave the parent digold(I) dimer.       Treatment of [Au2IICl2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] and [ClAu(&#181;-2-C6F4PPh2)(&#954;2-2-C6F4PPh2)AuCl] with an excess of silver nitrate, benzoate, acetate, trifluoroacetate or triflate gave the corresponding oxyanion complexes. Slow crystallisation of the di(benzoato)digold(II) complex from dichloromethane and methanol gave the parent digold(I) complex derived by reductive elimination. The di(triflato)digold(II) complex behaved similarly, although in this case the novel gold(I) tetramer [Au4(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)4] was formed together with the dimer. Two closely related gold complexes containing the chelating &#954;2(C,O) phosphine oxide ligand, 2-C6F4P(O)PPh2, were isolated from the reaction of [ClAu(&#181;-2-C6F4PPh2)(&#954;2-2-C6F4PPh2)AuCl] with an excess of silver nitrate. The reaction of [Au2IICl2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] with two equivalents of potassium trifluoroethoxide failed to give the corresponding digold(II) bis(alkoxo) complex; instead, reduction took place to form the digold(I) dimer [Au2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2].      Treatment of a solution of the di(benzoato)digold(II) complex with C6F5Li gave the pentafluorophenyl complex [Au2(C6F5)2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] which, when heated in toluene, rearranged to the gold(I)-gold(III) complex [(C6F5)Au(&#181;-2-C6F4PPh2)(&#954;2-2-C6F4PPh2)Au(C6F5)], analogous to the behaviour of the dihalodigold(II) complexes. The heterovalent, gold(I)-gold(III) dimethyl compound [Au2I,III(CH3)2(&#956;-2-C6F4PPh2)2] was obtained from the reaction of the di(benzoato)digold(II) complex with dimethylzinc. This compound is structurally similar to its tetraprotio analogue.        The cycloaurated dinuclear gold complexes [Au2(&#956;-C6H3-n-F-2-PPh2)2] (n = 5, 6) were made similarly to the 2-C6F4PPh2 analogue from the appropriate lithium or tin reagents, though in some cases the dimers were formed in admixture with the corresponding gold(I) tetramers.       Like their tetrafluoro analogues, the 6-fluoro complexes [Au2X2(&#956;-C6H3-6-F-2-PPh2)2] (X = Cl, Br, I) rearrange on heating to give the heterovalent gold(I)-gold(III) species [XAu(&#181;-C6H3-6-F-2-PPh2)(&#954;2-C6H3-6-F-2-PPh2)AuX]. Thus, the presence of a fluorine atom in place of hydrogen in the 6-position of the bridging aryl group is sufficient to stop the isomerisation of the digold(II) complexes [Au2X2(&#956;-2-C6H4PPh2)2] at the gold(I)-gold(III) stage and to prevent subsequent C-C coupling of the aryl groups at the gold(III) centre. In contrast, the dihalodigold(II) complexes containing the 5-fluoro substituted ligand undergo reductive elimination and coupling of the metallated aryl groups to give the digold(I) biphenyldiyl complexes [Au2X2(2,2'-Ph2P-5-FC6H3C6H3-5-F-PPh2)] (X = Cl, Br, I).

The central proposition of my research is that that 3D digital tools can enable interdependencies between crucial aspects of architectural and engineering design exploration during the early design phase which, before the entry of the computer, were otherwise impossible to affect.  I define interdependency as a productive form of practice enabled by mutual and lateral dependence.  Interdependent parties use problem solving processes that meet not only their own respective goals, but also those of others, by constructively engaging difference across their boundaries to actively search for solutions that go beyond the limits of singular domains.  Developed through practice-based project work undertaken during my 3 year postgraduate internship within the Melbourne Australia office of the engineering firm Arup, my research explores new and improved linkages between early design exploration, analysis and making.  The principal contribution of my research is to explore this problem from within the context, conditi ons and pressures of live practice.      To test the research proposition this dissertation engages firstly with available literature from the fields of organisation theory and design, secondly with information gathered from experts in the field principally via interview, and lastly with processes of testing through practice-based (as opposed to university-based) project work.  The dissertation is organized as follows:      The Introductory Chapter outlines the central hypothesis, the current state of the discourse, and my motivations for conducting this research.  I summarise the structure of my research, and the opportunities and limitations that have framed its ambitions.      Chapter Two, Approach to Research and Method, details the constraints and possibilities of the Embedded Research within Architectural Practice context, within which this work has been undertaken, and describes the Melbourne office of Arup, the practice with whom I have been embedded.  These contexts have led to the selection of a particular set of ethnographic research instruments, being the use of semi-structured interviews and the undertaking of practice-based studies as a participant-observer.  These modes of testing are explained, and the constraints, limitations and requirements associated with them described.        Within Chapter Three, Factors for Separation and Integration in Architectural and Engineering Design, I examine selected design literature to detail several factors impacting upon the historic and contemporary relationship between architects and engineers, and to introduce the problem towards which this thesis is addressed.  I describe a process of specialisation that has led architects and engineers to see different aspects of a common problem, detail the historical factors for separation, the current relationship between domains and the emerging idea of increased integration during the early design phase.  The aim of this section is primarily contextual - to introduce the characters and to understand why their interaction can be difficult - and investigation occurs through the concepts of specialisation and disciplinary roles.      Chapter Four, Unravelling Interdependency, establishes an understanding of interdependency through the concept of collaboration.  While I differentiate interdependency from collaboration because of the inconsistent manner in which the latter term is employed, the concept of collaboration is useful to initialise my understanding of interdependency because it, as opposed to the closely linked processes of cooperation and coordination, is recognised as being characterised by interdependency, and in fact is a viewed as a response specific to wider conditions of interdependency.  From the literature, I identify four sites of intersection crucial to an understanding of interdependency; these are differing perceptions, shared and creative problem solving, communication and trust.  These themes, which correlate with my practice experience at Arup Melbourne, are developed to introduce the concepts and vocabulary underlying my research.      Chapter Five, Intersections &amp; Interdependency between Architects and Engineers, grounds these four sites of intersection within contemporary issues of digital architectural and engineering practice.  Each site is developed firstly through reference to design literature and secondly through the experiences and understandings of senior Arup practitioners as captured through my interviews.  The views and experiences of these practitioners are used to locate digital limits to, and potential solutions for, interdependent design exploration between architects and engineers as they are experienced within and by practice.  Through this combination of design literature and grounded experience, I extend:      * the understanding of differing perceptions through reference to problems associated with digital information transfer.   * the understanding of joint and creative problem solving by connecting it to the notion of performance-based design.   * the understanding of communication by focussing it upon the idea of back propagating design information.   * the understanding of trust by connecting it to the management and reduction of perceived complexity and risk.      Chapter Six, Testing through Projects, details the project studies undertaken within this research.  These studies are grouped into three discourses, characterized as Design(Arch)Design(Eng), Design|Analysis and Design|Making.  As suggested by the concurrency operator that separates the two terms that constitute each of the three labels, each discourse tests how architectural and engineering explorations might execute in parallel.  The section Design(Arch)|Design(Eng) reports projects that use a common language of geometry to link architectural and engineering design ideas through geometric interpretation.  The section Design|Analysis reports projects in which analytical tools have been used generatively to actively guide and synthesise design exploration.  The final section, Design|Making, reports projects in which the architectural and engineering design processes are synthesised around the procurement of fabrication information.      Conclusions are then drawn and discussed in Chapter Seven.  In evaluating the research I discuss how 3D digital design tools have enabled alternative approaches that resolve issues associated with differing perceptions, establishing common meanings, communication and trust.  I summarise how these approaches have enabled increased interdependency in architect engineer interaction.  Lastly, I draw together the impacts of intersecting 3D digital aspects of architectural and engineering design exploration during the early design phase, and indicate those aspects that require further analysis and research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architectural and engineering design collaboration</field><field name="subject">3Ddigital methods and tools</field><field name="subject">design interdependency</field><field name="subject">shared and creative problem solving</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081204.151243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure, Function and Evolutionary Studies of Fasciola Cathepsin L-like Proteases</field><field name="creator">Norbury, Luke James</field><field name="description">Fasciola cause considerable monetary loss in the agriculture industry, while parasitism of humans is an emerging disease.  Fasciola cathepsin L-like proteases are believed to aid parasite invasion and survival through a range of functions including feeding, immune evasion and modulation, tissue migration, egg production and excystment.  As such these proteases are considered good targets for chemotherapies and vaccine development.   Fasciola cathepsins are evolutionarily divided into clades that reflect function and life stage of expression.  Analysis of F. gigantica genomic DNA and mRNA identified novel cathepsin L-like sequences which are incorporated into a phylogenetic analysis of the complete Fasciola cathepsin L-like protease family.     Analysis of mRNA transcripts isolated in this study also points to trans-splicing occurring amongst cathepsin transcripts, the first time this has been identified in Fasciola species.     S2 subsite specificity is important in determining substrate interactions with cathepsin L-like proteases.  Previous work has shown that amino acid substitutions at this site can dramatically influence substrate specificity.  A number of substitutions, specifically those that have been observed, or predicted to occur during the evolution of Fasciola cathepsins L-like proteases, were introduced into the S2 subsite of FhCatL5 at aa69 to determine their influence.     The introduction of L69C and L69S substitutions resulted in low overall activity indicating their expression provides no functional advantage, thus explaining the absence of such variants amongst fluke.  The L69F variant showed an increase in the ability to cleave substrates with P2 proline, indicating F69 variants expressed by fluke are also likely to have this ability, similar to that shown with L69Y and FhCatL2.   The introduction of a L69W substitution leads to increased cleavage of substrates with P2 proline, along with a decrease in cleavage of substrates with P2 phenylalanine.     FgCatL1G transcripts were isolated from F. gigantica metacercariae.  This contrasts with FhCatL5 and FhCatL2 which have been isolated in adult F. hepatica.  These cathepsins differ at aa69, possessing tryptophan, leucine and tyrosine respectively.  The processing and substrate specificities of each recombinant enzyme was analysed and compared.  While FhCatL5 and FhCatL2 process in vitro in a manner similar to that reported for FhCatL1, FgCatL1G requires different processing conditions, including neutral pH.  Combined with FgCatL1G possessing increased stability at acidic pH, this reflects the different environment into which FgCatL1G is expressed by immature compared to the adult flukes.   The substrate specificity of FgCatL1G also differed from previously reported cathepsins, with a preference for P2 proline and low activity against substrates with P2 phenylalanine.  This is the first time recombinant expression and purification of a cathepsin L-like protease specific to the immature life stages of Fasciola has been undertaken and had enzyme specificity analysed.     This work has expanded knowledge of the repertoire of cathepsin proteases expressed at various life-stages of the liver fluke. Vaccination and/or drug inhibition studies may in the future be targeted towards cathepsins that are expressed in either the adult or immature stage, or perhaps both in a multi-targeted approach. The knowledge gained in this study may allow such targets to be chosen.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fasciola</field><field name="subject">cathepsin L</field><field name="subject">cysteine protease</field><field name="subject">S2 subsite</field><field name="subject">substrate specificity</field><field name="subject">site-directed mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">RNA splicing</field><field name="subject">molecular modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081204.160915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective retrieval techniques for Arabic text</field><field name="creator">Nwesri, Abdusalam F Ahmad</field><field name="description">Arabic is a major international language, spoken in more than 23   countries, and the lingua franca of the Islamic world. The number   of Arabic-speaking Internet users has grown over nine-fold in the Middle   East between the year 2000 and 2007, yet research in Arabic Information   Retrieval (AIR) has not advanced as in other languages such as English.   In this thesis, we explore techniques that improve the performance of AIR systems.      Stemming is considered one of the most important factors to improve retrieval effectiveness of AIR systems. Most   current stemmers remove affixes without checking whether the removed letters   are actually affixes. We propose lexicon-based improvements to light   stemming that distinguish core letters from proper Arabic affixes. We devise   rules to stem most affixes and show their effects on retrieval effectiveness. Using the   TREC 2001 test collection, we show that applying relevance feedback with our   rules produces significantly better results than light stemming.      Techniques for Arabic information retrieval have been studied in depth on   clean collections of newswire dispatches.  However, the effectiveness   of such techniques is not known on other noisy collections in which  text is   generated using automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems  and queries are   generated using machine translations (MT).      Using noisy collections, we show that normalisation, stopping and light   stemming improve results  as in normal text collections   but that n-grams and root stemming decrease performance.      Most recent AIR research has been undertaken using collections that are far   smaller than the collections used for English text retrieval;  consequently,   the significance of some published results is debatable. Using the LDC   Arabic GigaWord collection that contains more than 1 500 000 documents,   we create a test collection of~90 topics with their relevance judgements.   Using this test collection, we show empirically that for a large collection, root stemming is not competitive. Of the approaches we have studied, lexicon-based stemming approaches perform better than light stemming approaches alone.      Arabic text commonly includes foreign words transliterated into Arabic   characters.  Several transliterated forms may be in common use for a single   foreign word, but users rarely use more than one variant during search   tasks.       We test the effectiveness of lexicons, Arabic patterns, and n-grams in   distinguishing foreign words from native Arabic words. We introduce rules that help   filter foreign words and improve the n-gram approach used in language identification.   Our combined n-grams and lexicon approach successfully identifies 80% of all   foreign words with a precision of 93%.      To find variants of a specific foreign word, we apply phonetic and string similarity   techniques and introduce novel algorithms to normalise them in Arabic text. We   modify phonetic techniques used for English to suit the Arabic language, and compare   several techniques to determine their effectiveness in finding foreign word variants.   We show that our algorithms significantly improve recall. We also show that expanding queries using variants identified by our Soutex4 phonetic algorithm results in a significant improvement in precision and recall.      Together, the approaches described in this thesis represent an important step towards realising highly effective retrieval of Arabic text.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arabic language</field><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">stemming</field><field name="subject">query expansion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081204.163422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-adiabatic dynamics of excited states of molecular oxygen</field><field name="creator">Wang, Jingbo.</field><field name="description">Typescript (Photocopy) Bibliography: leaves vii-xiv.

Inulin was extracted from the whole JA tubers using hydrothermal extraction process, followed by clarification and concentration. The concentrate was fractionated using two different procedures i.e. ethanol fractionation and cold precipitation (&#61483;+4 and/or -24C) into high- and low-molecular-weight components. The most satisfactory method was cold fractionation wherein the insoluble heavier inulin fractions were found to settle to the bottom and were separated and spray-dried to obtain inulin powder. Lactose in MCP was isomerised into lactulose using carbonate-based catalysts (oyster shell and egg shell powders) followed by clarification and concentration. The high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index detector (HPLC-RID) chr omatograms and changes in pH and colour values confirmed the conversion of lactose into lactulose and decomposition of lactulose into by-products. The results obtained showed the suitability of oyster shell powder for lactose isomerisation in lieu of egg shell powder. For preparing lactulose-enriched MCP with acceptable lactulose yield of 22%, the optimum reaction conditions were found to be catalyst loading of 12 mg per mL of MCP and isomerisation time of 120 min at 96C.      The resulting products i.e. JAI concentrate and powder and lactulose-enriched MCP syrup (40&#61616;B) were tested for their prebiotic power in media broth and in fermented milk models. Prebiotic properties of these compounds were observed as supplementation levels increased from 0-2% to 3-4%. Based on the growth and acidification abilities of the probiotic strains tested, the combination of Lactobacillus casei LC-01 with JAI, and Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 with lactulose-enriched MCP syrup were found to be the best for development of synbiotic yoghurt. The prebiotic effect of JAIP was then compared with the two commercial chicory inulin products (Raftiline GR and Raftilose P95). Probiotic yoghurts supplemented with 4% inulin powders were prepared from reconstituted skim milk using mixed cultures of Lactobacillus casei LC-01, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (1:0.5:0.5, w/w). The survival and acidifying activity of probiotic and lactic acid cultures were investiga ted during the shelf life of 28 days at 4&#61616;C. Incorporation of JAIP and chicory inulins resulted in a significant improvement in viability of LC-01 compared with non-supplemented yoghurt, maintaining more than 107 CFU g-1 throughout storage time.      Additionally, the suitability of JAIP as fat replacer was determined in a set of fat-free yoghurt in comparison to three commercial chicory inulin products. Results of large deformation tests revealed that the firmness of JAIP-supplemented yoghurt was reduced to a similar level as the full-fat control yoghurt. However, small deformation results showed that the JAIP could not fully mimic milk fat to the same extent as Raftiline HP with an average DP of 23. The rheological effects of JAIP addition were comparable to those of short-chain (Raftilose P95 with an average DP of 4) and medium-chain inulins (Raftiline&#174; GR with an average DP of 12).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prebiotics</field><field name="subject">Jerusalem artichoke</field><field name="subject">Inulin</field><field name="subject">Lactulose</field><field name="subject">Milk concentration permeate</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081205.111622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Debugging Multi-Agent Systems With Design Documents</field><field name="creator">Poutakidis, David Alexander</field><field name="description">Debugging multi-agent systems, which are concurrent, distributed, and consist of    complex components is difficult, yet crucial.  The development of these complex systems is supported by agent-oriented software engineering methodologies which utilise agents as the central design metaphor.  The systems that are developed are inherently complex since the components of these systems may interact in flexible and sophisticated ways and traditional debugging techniques are not appropriate.   Despite this, very little effort has been applied to developing appropriate debugging tools and techniques.  Debugging multi-agent systems without good debugging tools is highly impractical and without suitable debugging support developing and maintaining multi-agent systems will be more difficult than it need be.      In this thesis we propose that the debugging process can be supported by following an agent-oriented design methodology, and then using the developed design artifacts in the debugging phase. We propose a domain independent debugging framework which comprises the developed processes and components that are necessary in using design artifacts as debugging artifacts.  Our approach is to take a non-formal design artifact, such as an AUML protocol design, and encode it in a machine interpretable manner such that the design can be used as a model of correct system behaviour.  These models are used by a run-time debugging system to compare observed behaviour against specified behaviour.  We provide details for transforming two design artifact types into equivalent debugging artifacts and show how these can be used to detect bugs.         During a debugging episode in which a bug has been identified our debugging approach can provide detailed information about the possible reason for the bug occurring.  To determine if this information was useful in helping to debug programs we undertook a thorough empirical study and identified that use of the debugging tool translated to an improvement in debugging performance.  We conclude that the debugging techniques developed in this thesis provide effective debugging support for multi-agent systems and by having an extensible framework new design artifacts can be explored and as translations are developed they can be added to the debugging system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-Agent Systems</field><field name="subject">Agent Oriented Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">Debugging</field><field name="subject">Agent UML</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081205.114106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of antioxidants on thrombotic risk factors in healthy population</field><field name="creator">Singh, Indu</field><field name="description">Oxidative damage has been suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular disease. Increased free radical production induced by oxidative stress can oxidise low density lipoproteins, activates platelets, induces endothelial dysfunction and disturbs glucose transport by consuming endogenous antioxidants. Using a combination, of in vitro and in vivo experimental models, the primary aims of the studies undertaken for this thesis were to examine whether different antioxidants could negate risk factors leading to thrombosis, atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. The studies utilised the mechanisms involved in platelet activity and glucose uptake by skeletal muscle myotubes.       The first study determined if olive leaf extract would attenuate platelet activity in healthy human subjects. Blood samples (n=11) were treated with five different concentrations of extract of Olea europaea L. leaves ranging from 5.4&#163;gg/mL to 54&#163;gg/mL. A significant reduction in platelet activity (pless than0.001) and ATP release from platelets (p=0.02) was observed with 54&#163;gg/mL olive leaf extract. The next crossover study compared the effect of exercise and antioxidant supplementation on platelet function between trained and sedentary individuals. An acute bout of 1 hour exercise (sub maximal cycling at 70% of VO2max) was used to induce oxidative stress in 8 trained and 8 sedentary male subjects, before and after one week supplementation with 236 mg/day of cocoa polyphenols. Baseline platelet count and ATP release increased significantly (pless than0.05) after exercise in all subjects. Baseline platelet numbers in the trained were higher than in the sedentary (235&#161;&#211;37 vs. 208&#161;&#211;34 x109/L, p less than 0.05),  whereas platelet activation in trained subjects was lower than sedentary individuals (51&#161;&#211;6 vs. 59&#161;&#211;5%, p less than0.05). Seven days of cocoa polyphenol supplementation did not change platelet activity compared to the placebo group. The third study determined the effect of 5 weeks of either 100mg/day &#163;^-Tocopherol (n=14), 200mg/d &#163;^-Tocopherol (n=13) or placebo (n=12) on platelet function, lipid profile and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein. Blood &#163;^-tocopherol concentrations increased significantly (pless than0.05) relative to dose. Both doses attenuated platelet activation (pless than0.05). LDL cholesterol, platelet aggregation and mean platelet volume were decreased by 100mg/d &#163;^-tocopherol (all pless than0.05). The final study determined the effect of glucose oxidase induced oxidative stress and &#163;^-tocopherol treatment on glucose transport and insulin signalling in cultured rat L6 muscle cells. One hour treatment with 100mU/mL glucose oxidase significantly decreased glucose uptake both with and  without 100nM insulin stimulation (pless than0.05). Pre-treatment with 100&#131;&#221;M and 200&#131;&#221;M &#163;^-tocopherol partially protected cells from the effect of glucose oxidase, whereas 200&#131;&#221;M &#163;^-tocopherol restored both basal and insulin stimulated glucose transport to control levels. Glucose oxidase-induced oxidative stress did not impair basal or insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt or AS160, but 200&#131;&#221;M &#163;^-tocopherol improved insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of these proteins.       In summary, the results from the studies undertaken for this thesis provide evidence that antioxidant supplementation maintains normal platelet function, exerts a positive effect on blood lipid profile and improves glucose uptake in normal healthy asymptomatic population as well as under conditions of induced oxidative stress. Antioxidants including foods rich in cocoa, olive and gamma tocopherol have the potential to combat oxidative stress induced risk factors leading to cardiovascular diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antioxidants</field><field name="subject">Platelet aggregation</field><field name="subject">platelet activation</field><field name="subject">L6 myotubes</field><field name="subject">Glucose uptake</field><field name="subject">Akt</field><field name="subject">AS160</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081205.121719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of Self-assembled Gold Nanocluster Patterns in Ion Implanted Silicon: Order from Disorder</field><field name="creator">Venkatachalam, Dinesh Kumar</field><field name="description">Gold (Au) implantation in silicon (Si) has been a topic of great interest from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Ion implantation is a versatile technique due to its ability to form surface-embedded nanoparticles that provide better adhesion. Also, being an integral part of the substrate lattice, the nanoclusters produced by ion implantation are free from impurities and their size distribution can be controlled by carefully optimizing the beam parameters. During our experiments to produce nanoclusters of Au on Si for use as seeds for the growth of nanowires, we stumbled across an unusual pattern formation process under specific conditions. This unique self-assembly process is observed only within a critical threshold implantation fluence and above a threshold annealing temperature. Fabrication of ordered arrays of metal nanoparticles on Si substrates is of significance for both fundamental science associated with low-dimensional physics and technical app lications. The application of functional nanostructures strongly depends on their assembly in ordered one- or two- dimensional arrangements. These arrangements may play an important role in fabricating ordered arrays of semiconductor/oxide nanowires.This thesis discusses a systematic study performed to understand the temperature and time dependent nucleation, growth of Au nanoclusters and evolution of the self-assembled patterns. A growth model is proposed to show the re-crystallization behaviour of Au supersaturated amorphous silicon (a-Si) on Si substrate.      The observed self-assembled periodic patterns of Au nanoclusters bear resemblance to the Liesegang ring structures prevalent in some chemical reaction-diffusion systems. Based on this systematic study of the growth and morphology of Au nanoclusters, a tentative growth mechanism has been proposed for the formation mechanism of this unusual self-assembled pattern. The pattern formation of this non-equilibrium process is expected to originate due to instabilities of the three scales of Au nanoclusters at elevated temperatures. The kinetics of pattern formation from a supersaturated solid solution (a-Si/Au alloy) is demonstrated using numerical solutions obtained by a two-dimensional growth model, which takes into account the nucleation, diffusion and the aggregation process. The numerical solution of the diffusion equations appear to be in good agreement with the experimental results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-assembly</field><field name="subject">gold nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">ion implantation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081209.113630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crater Lake: A Study of the Monster Within.</field><field name="creator">Wearne, Olivia</field><field name="description">For my project I shall be writing a feature length screenplay in the horror genre.

This work addresses two important issues which are   &#149;	the efficient representation of mouth movement for visual speech recognition   &#149;	the temporal segmentation of utterances from video.   The first part of the thesis describes a robust movement-based technique used to identify mouth movement patterns while uttering phonemes. This method temporally integrates the video data of each phoneme into a 2-D grayscale image named as a motion template (MT). This is a view-based approach that implicitly encodes the temporal component of an image sequence into a scalar-valued MT. The data size was reduced by extracting image descriptors such as Zernike moments (ZM) and discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients from MT. Support vector machine (SVM) and hidden Markov model (HMM) were used to classify the feature descriptors. A video speech corpus of 2800 utterances was collected for evaluating the efficacy of MT for lip-reading. The experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of MT in mouth movement representation. The advantages and limitations of MT for visual speech recognition were identified and validated through experiments. A comparison between ZM and DCT features indicates that th e accuracy of classification for both methods is very comparable when there is no relative motion between the camera and the mouth. Nevertheless, ZM is resilient to rotation of the camera and continues to give good results despite rotation but DCT is sensitive to rotation. DCT features are demonstrated to have better tolerance to image noise than ZM. The results also demonstrate a slight improvement of 5% using SVM as compared to HMM. The second part of this thesis describes a video-based, temporal segmentation framework to detect key frames corresponding to the start and stop of utterances from an image sequence, without using the acoustic signals. This segmentation technique integrates mouth movement and appearance information. The efficacy of this technique was tested through experimental evaluation and satisfactory performance was achieved. This segmentation method has been demonstrated to perform efficiently for utterances separated with short pauses. Potential applications for lip-reading technologies  include human computer interface (HCI) for mobility-impaired users, defense applications that require voice-less communication, lip-reading mobile phones, in-vehicle systems, and improvement of speech-based computer control in noisy environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">video analysis</field><field name="subject">visual speech recognition</field><field name="subject">motion template</field><field name="subject">Zernike moments</field><field name="subject">discrete cosine transform</field><field name="subject">support vector machines</field><field name="subject">hidden Markov Models</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081209.162504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A System Dynamics Model of Construction Output in Kenya</field><field name="creator">Mbiti, Titus Kivaa Peter</field><field name="description">This study investigates fluctuations of construction output, and growth of the output in Kenya. Fluctuation and growth of construction activity are matters of concern in construction industries of many countries in the developing as well as in the developed world. The construction industry of Kenya is therefore an exemplifying case for this phenomenon.      Construction activity in Kenya fluctuates excessively and grows very slowly. This remains a big challenge to policy makers, developers, consultants and contractors in their decision-making processes. In this study, systems thinking was applied to investigate the problem of excessive fluctuations and stunted growth of construction output in Kenya. The study developed a system dynamics model to simulate the construction output problem behaviour. The historical behaviour of the construction industry was described using construction output data of a 40-year period - from 1964 to 2003. Line graphs of the historical data exhibited profiles that helped to identify the system archetypes operating in the industry. From the profiles, it was deduced that the problem of fluctuations and slow growth of construction output in Kenya is encapsulated in two system archetypes, namely: balancing process with a delay, and limits to growth. The relationship between construction output and its determinant factors from the constru ction industry's environment was investigated using time series regression, which involved autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) regression and multiple regression modelling of the output.       On the basis of the historical data analysis and the system archetypes identified, a system dynamics (SD) model was developed to replicate the problem of fluctuations and slow growth in the construction output. The data used to develop the system dynamics model was annual construction output in Kenya from 1964 to 2003. The model was then used: to appraise policy changes suggested by construction industry participants in Kenya, and to project construction output in Kenya from year 2004 to year 2050, in order to establish the expected future fluctuations and growth trends of the construction output. It was observed that three fundamental changes are necessary in the system structure of the construction industry of Kenya, in order to minimize fluctuations and foster growth in construction output in the country, in the long run. The changes are: setting long-term targets of annual construction output in the industry as a whole, incorporating reserve capacity in the production process, and expanding the system st ructure to capture a larger construction market.       The study recommends regulation of the response of the construction industry of Kenya to changes in construction demand in the market, and expansion of the construction industry's market into the African region and beyond.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction industry of Kenya</field><field name="subject">construction output</field><field name="subject">fluctuations in output</field><field name="subject">growth of output</field><field name="subject">systems thinking</field><field name="subject">system archetypes</field><field name="subject">system dynamics</field><field name="subject">ARIMA</field><field name="subject">time series regression</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081211.160910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software design measures for distributed enterprise Information systems</field><field name="creator">Rossi, Pablo Hernan</field><field name="description">Enterprise information systems are increasingly being developed as distributed information systems. Quality attributes of distributed information systems, as in the centralised case, should be evaluated as early and as accurately as possible in the software engineering process. In particular, software measures associated with quality attributes of such systems should consider the characteristics of modern distributed technologies.           Early design decisions have a deep impact on the implementation of distributed enterprise information systems and thus, on the ultimate quality of the software as an operational entity. Due to the fact that the distributed-software engineering process affords software engineers a number of design alternatives, it is important to develop tools and guidelines that can be used to assess and compare design artefacts quantitatively.           This dissertation makes a contribution to the field of Software Engineering by proposing and evaluating software design measures for distributed enterprise information systems. In previous research, measures developed for distributed software have been focused in code attributes, and thus, only provide feedback towards the end of the software engineering process. In contrast, this thesis proposes a number of specific design measures that provide quantitative information before the implementation. These measures capture attributes of the structure and behaviour of distributed information systems that are deemed important to assess their quality attributes, based on the analysis of the problem domain.          The measures were evaluated theoretically and empirically as part of a well defined methodology. On the one hand, we have followed a formal framework based on the theory of measurement, in order to carry out the theoretical validation of the proposed measures. On the other hand, the suitability of the measures, to be used as indicators of quality attributes, was evaluated empirically with a robust statistical technique for exploratory research. The data sets analysed were gathered after running several experiments and replications with a distributed enterprise information system. The results of the empirical evaluation show that most of the proposed measures are correlated to the quality attributes of interest, and that most of these measures may be used, individually or in combination, for the estimation of these quality attributes-namely efficiency, reliability and maintainability.       The design of a distributed information system is modelled as a combination of its structure, which reflects static characteristics, and its behaviour, which captures complementary dynamic aspects. The behavioural measures showed slightly better individual and combined results than the structural measures in the experimentation. This was in line with our expectations, since the measures were evaluated as indicators of non-functional quality attributes of the operational system. On the other hand, the structural measures provide useful feedback that is available earlier in the software engineering process.        Finally, we developed a prototype application to collect the proposed measures automatically and examined typical real-world scenarios where the measures may be used to make design decisions as part of the software engineering process.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software design measurement</field><field name="subject">software quality evaluation</field><field name="subject">distributed systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081211.164307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hormonal regulation of the testicular Sertoli cell tight junction</field><field name="creator">McCabe, Mark James</field><field name="description">The Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ) of the seminiferous epithelium is important for the developmental process of spermatogenesis as it separates germ cells in the seminiferous tubules from the general circulation in the testicular interstitium. Absence of the TJ leads to spermatogenic arrest and infertility. TJs form at puberty as circulating gonadotrophins luteinising hormone/testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone increase. Several studies have demonstrated hormonal regulation of the two major TJ proteins, claudin-11 and occludin, and also of TJ function in vitro and in vivo. Men with low levels of circulating gonadotrophins exhibit an immature and dysfunctional TJ phenotype, which is reversed upon the exogenous application of gonadotrophins.    This thesis hypothesises that claudin-11 and occludin are the major contributors to TJ function, and that gonadotrophins regulate TJ function and structure via these two proteins in several species including humans.   This PhD was divided into four separate studies to address these hypotheses. The first study selectively silenced the genetic expression of claudin-11 and occludin with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in cultured immature rat Sertoli cells to determine their contribution to Sertoli cell TJ function in vitro. siRNA treatment against either protein significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced TJ function by ~50% as assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance. Immunocytochemistry displayed marked reductions in the localisation of these proteins to the TJ after siRNA treatment. It was concluded that both proteins significantly contributed to TJ function in vitro.    The second and third studies then aimed to study hormonal regulation of the TJ in vivo. Weekly injections of the gonadotrophin releasing hormone antagonist acyline were used to suppress circulating gonadotrophins and spermatogenesis in adult rats. Acyline treatment disrupted i) the localisation of occludin to the TJ and ii) TJ function as shown by permeability to a biotin tracer, which was impermeable to TJs in controls. Short-term hormone replacement partially restored the effects of gonadotrophin suppression. It was concluded that gonadotrophins regulate the maintenance of the TJ in rats in vivo.    The third study used the hypogonadal (hpg) mouse, which is a naturally occurring model of gonadotrophin deficiency with inactive spermatogenesis. Claudin-11 in hpg mice was not localised at the TJs, and these were dysfunctional as shown by permeability to biotin. Following hormone treatment, TJs were structurally and functionally competent, demonstrating that gonadotrophins also regulate the formation of TJs in vivo.    The fourth study subsequently analysed TJs in gonadotrophin suppressed men, and it was found that claudin-11 staining was reduced from continuous bands in control men, to punctate staining in gonadotrophin-suppressed men, demonstrating that gonadotrophins also regulate the localisation of claudin-11 to the TJ in men in vivo.   In summary, it is concluded that the Sertoli cell TJ is hormonally regulated, and that the major contributors to TJ function in vivo and in vitro are claudin-11 and occludin. It is hypothesised that the reduction of claudin-11 localisation to the TJ in men may also result in a loss of human Sertoli cell TJ function, suggesting that the TJ may be a potential target of hormonal contraception in men.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tight junction</field><field name="subject">spermatogenesis</field><field name="subject">claudin-11</field><field name="subject">occludin</field><field name="subject">gonadotrophins</field><field name="subject">Sertoli cell</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081212.100348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Black Comedy and the Principles of Screenwriting/The Actions</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Nicholas Elliott</field><field name="description">This exegesis will aim to research and analyse the conventions of writing a black comedy in a feature film script.

How to generate useful chaos that is also practically implementable and useful is a current focus of research. This research aims at developing new chaos generation schemes which demonstrate complex dynamical behaviours using simple linear systems with hysteresis function series.        A continuous-time linear unstable second-order system with a feedback of hysteresis function is first proposed for generating chaos. The design for chaos generation is studied theoretically. A Poincar&#233; map is used to demonstrate the dynamical behaviour of the system. The existence and the analytic solution of the limit cycle that bounds the basin of attraction of the chaotic attractor are derived. Conditions for the existence of chaotic attractors are studied. A hysteresis based system with a maximum chaotic stability margin is designed.        Second, systematic methods for generating 1D n-scroll chaotic attractors in the directions of the state variables and 2D nxm-grid scroll chaotic attractors in the phase plane via continuous-time linear unstable second-order systems with a feedback of hysteresis function series are proposed. Furthermore, systematic methods for generating 1D n-scroll, 2D nxm-grid scroll and 3D nxmxl-space scroll chaotic attractors via continuous-time linear unstable third-order systems using hysteresis function series feedback are also presented in this thesis. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the schemes. It is shown that the multi-scroll chaos generation systems can be represented in Lur'e form, and as a result it may be used within synchronization schemes for secure communication.        Third, the limit cycle that bounds the basin of attraction in the multi-scroll chaos generation with second-order systems case is studied. The relationship of the size of the basin of attraction with the numbers of hysteresis function series is studied. The multi-scroll chaos generation mechanism is then further explored by analyzing the system trajectories; the switching boundaries, switching rules and the trajectories on each subspace. The chaotic behaviours are confirmed theoretically and it is proved that a non-ordinary attractor exists in the multi-scroll chaotic attractor of the second-order systems case. The abundant dynamical behaviour of the multi-scroll chaos generation systems using different hysteresis feedback are demonstrated.        A double-hysteresis function, which is the superimposition of two basic hysteresis functions, is proposed for the implementation of the hysteresis based chaotic system. In this design, the double-hysteresis block and its series are constructed via a systematic method. The ideal hysteresis function series can be implemented easily with the proposed double-hysteresis function. The number of scroll attractors can be designed arbitrarily, and the multi-scroll chaotic attractors can be located anywhere and cover any chosen area of the phase plane. The circuitry implementation for generating 1D n-scroll, 2D nxm-grid scroll chaotic attractors with linear second-order systems and hysteresis function series is given. And the oscilloscope illustrated waveforms which included as many as 9x9=81 scrolls chaotic attractor are presented.        The experimental results confirmed the theoretical analysis very well and validated the effectiveness as well as the feasibility of the proposed multi-scroll chaos generation schemes. This research may find potential engineering applications in areas such as digital coding and image processing, etc.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chaos</field><field name="subject">hysteresis</field><field name="subject">linear systems</field><field name="subject">multi-scroll chaotic attractor</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081212.120739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiropractic and male adolescent low back pain: a Victoria perspective</field><field name="creator">Ebrall, Phillip Stuart</field><field name="description">This thesis was initiated by an awareness of the impact of low back pain in Western society in general and Australian society in particular. The studies and experiments in this thesis contribute towards an understanding of chiropractic as a professional entity in Victoria and the nature of its clinical practice. The issue of male adolescent LBP has been explored and in addition to an epidemiological description of this clinical entity, its anthropometric dimensions have been documented.        The qualitative review of the literature provides ample justification for the management of patients with LBP by chiropractors, using manual or manipulative techniques. The observational study of the Victorian context in which chiropractors are educated, registered, and entitled to practice, demonstrates that Victorian chiropractors are appropriate providers of manipulative health care. They perform the role of primary contact, primary health care providers with diagnostic, treatment and management skills focussed mainly on musculoskeletal conditions, but with a small proportion of practice based in the health or preventive context, and are well placed to provide the manual and manipulative services required in the management of LBP patients.         The profession is shown to have strategies in place to ensure continued legal and community acceptance. The strategies include those at entry level to the profession, such as the legislative provisions of government and the competencies required for registration as instilled during the professional education process, and those which are more of the nature to maintain the integrity of professional practice, such as the "   standards of practice"    concept. These are important characteristics given it is shown that the Victorian chiropractic profession is not homogenous with respect to educational standards, has a disparate gender balance, the presence of a few non-registered 'chiropractors', and a disparity in utilisation patterns with a significant tail to the right.        However the chiropractic profession is shown to hold a position of strength and leadership in the Australian context with respect to the provision of manipulative health care. Indeed, it could be said that chiropractors are at the leading edge of the quality process with respect to the provision of manipulative health care in Australia.          The description of chiropractic practice shows a patient base of all ages, including adolescents, presenting with a range of possible diagnoses, often funded by a third party, and with a high proportion of return visits suggestive of patient compliance and satisfaction.       It is convincingly demonstrated that persons with work-related LBP attend to chiropractors in Victoria and are effectively managed with the aim being the restoration of optimal spinal function and, in the case of work-injured patients, an early return to work.        This thesis includes utilisation data which suggest only a minority of Victorian chiropractors practice outside the responsible parameters described above. The case-mix data and patient profiles presented in this thesis are congruent and complement each other, suggesting a high level of patient satisfaction indicated by the high proportion of return visits by regular patients and a faster, return-to-work by work-injured claimants.        The point and sample prevalence of LBP in a population of suburban male adolescents is described and shown to be similar to those found in comparable Western societies. The data for a sample of traditional Australian male adolescents describes the LBP experience for the first time in such a population and emphasises the wide variance between societies which is now being identified in the literature.        The LBP experience of a typical suburban Australian male adolescent is identified and described in terms of chronicity, frequency and episode duration. Typically the male adolescent with LBP has a chronic (&gt; 90 d) problem with frequent episodes of pain (from 2 or 3 times a month to 2 or 3 times week) which last a few hours. The pain is a little limiting but allows the performance of the Activities of Daily Living. While some limitation of general sporting activity due to pain is experienced, school attendance is generally not compromised.       A particular clinical instrument, the Metrecom computerised electro-goniometer, is studied and found to be appropriate for use in gathering anthropometric dimensions to test hypotheses relating to an association between anthropometric dimensions and LBP in a male adolescent population. The applied level of uncertainty of the instrument is within acceptable limits for these dimensions.        The anthropometric study tests the broad null hypothesis that the mean of specific anthropometric dimensions would be equal among samples of male adolescents drawn from the Australian population. The actual groups are a Melbourne 'Pain' group, a Melbourne 'No Pain' group, and a 'Traditional No Pain' group. The pain group reported either current LBP or a positive history of LBP, while the 'no pain' groups denied either current or historical LBP.        The alternate hypothesis will be shown to be proven for the dimensions 'sitting height', 'upper body' length, 'pelvic height', and the ratio of the 'upper:lower' body segment in a population of male adolescents with idiopathic or mechanical LBP.       This thesis meets its objectives of describing the chiropractic profession and its practise in the Victorian context, demonstrates the prevalence of LBP in a male adolescent population, and identifies particular anthropometric dimensions associated with those who report a LBP experience.        The fact that a number of anthropometric dimensions are detectable in adolescence may allow the development of appropriate screening programs which in turn may lead to the design and introduction of suitable prophylactic interventional programs for persons found to be potentially prone to idiopathic or mechanical LBP, at the least reducing the severity and at most reducing the onset of this expensive problem in adulthood. The ratio of the upper body segment to the lower body segment would appear to be most appropriate indicator; it is robust in that it is a prime dimension, easily accessible, and with a low level of measurement uncertainty. Most importantly it would appear to hold validity throughout adolescence as it does not have a linear relationship with age.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chiropractic</field><field name="subject">adolescent low back pain</field><field name="subject">low bak pain</field><field name="subject">anthropometry</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081212.145143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical schemes for unsteady transonic flow calculation</field><field name="creator">Ly, Eddie</field><field name="description">An obvious reason for studying unsteady flows is the prediction of the effect of unsteady aerodynamic forces on a flight vehicle, since these effects tend to increase the likelihood of aeroelastic instabilities. This is a major concern in aerodynamic design of aircraft that operate in transonic regime, where the flows are characterised by the presence of adjacent regions of subsonic and supersonic flow, usually accompanied by weak shocks. It has been a common expectation that the numerical approach as an alternative to wind tunnel experiments would become more economical as computers became less expensive and more powerful. However even with all the expected future advances in computer technology, the cost of a numerical flutter analysis (computational aeroelasticity) for a transonic flight remains prohibitively high. Hence it is vitally important to develop an efficient, cheaper (in the sense of computational cost) and physically accurate flutter simulation tech nique which is capable of reproducing the data, which would otherwise be obtained from wind tunnel tests, at least to some acceptable engineering accuracy, and that it is essentially appropriate for industrial applications. This need motivated the present research work on exploring and developing efficient and physically accurate computational techniques for steady, unsteady and time-linearised calculations of transonic flows over an aircraft wing with moving shocks.        	This dissertation is subdivided into eight chapters, seven appendices and a bibliography listing all the reference materials used in the research work. The research work initially starts with a literature survey in unsteady transonic flow theory and calculations, in which emphasis is placed upon the developments in these areas in the last three decades.        	Chapter 3 presents the small disturbance theory for potential flows in the subsonic, transonic and supersonic regimes, including the required boundary conditions and shock jump conditions. The flow is assumed irrotational and inviscid, so that the equation of state, continuity equation and Bernoulli's equation formulated in Appendices A and B can be employed to formulate the governing fluid equation in terms of total velocity potential. Furthermore for transonic flow with free-stream Mach number close to unity, we show in Appendix C that the shocks that appear are weak enough to allow us to neglect the flow rotationality. The formulations are based on the main assumption that aerofoil slopes are everywhere small, and the flow quantities are small perturbations about their free-stream values.        	In Chapter 4, we developed an improved approximate factorisation algorithm that solves the two-dimensional steady subsonic small disturbance equation with nonreflecting far-field boundary conditions. The finite difference formulation for the improved algorithm is presented in Appendix D, with the description of the solver used for solving the system of difference equations described in Appendix E.        	The calculation of steady and unsteady nonlinear transonic flows over a realistic aerofoil are considered in Chapter 5. Numerical solution methods, based on the finite difference approach, for solving the two-dimensional steady and unsteady, general-frequency transonic small disturbance equations are presented, with the corresponding finite difference formulation described in Appendix F.        	The theories and solution methods for the time-linearised calculations, in the frequency and time domains, for the problem of unsteady transonic flow over a thin planar wing undergoing harmonic oscillation are presented in Chapters 6 and 7, respectively. The time-linearised calculations include the periodic shock motion via the shock jump correction procedure. This procedure corrects the solution values behind the shock, to accommodate the effect of shock motion, and consequently, the solution method will produce a more accurate time-linearised solution for supercritical flow. Appendix G presents the finite difference formulation of these time-linearised solution methods. The aim is to develop an efficient computational method for calculating oscillatory transonic aerodynamic quantities efficiently for use in flutter analyses of both two- and three-dimensional wings with lifting surfaces.

In Australia, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an environmental pest, strongly coloured (dark-muscle fish), large (2-3 kg), low cost (AUD 2.5/kg) and not highly valued as it is every where else. Surimi could add value to carp, but the colour would have to be modified as surimi manufacturers prefer white coloured flesh. So, firstly the efficiency of Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; 1-3% v/v) solution at alkaline side of pH (7.0-11.5) on whitening of light fillets of common carp was examined. The whiteness (L*-3b*) of surimi produced from treated (3% H2O2, pH 8.2) common carp light fillets was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater than that of threadfin bream surimi and was not significantly different to that of Alaska pollock. Based on a temperature sweep test, a similar pattern in G of tested surimi was observed which started at ca. 47?C and was completed at ca. 73-74?C. However, thread fin bream kamaboko showed better texture profile characteristics (hardness and gel strength) than that of the other kamaboko tested.      To improve the quality of common carp surimi and kamaboko, alternative methods were applied such as modified conventional method (MCM), alkaline-aided method (AAM) and pH modified method (PMM) and the resultant surimi and kamaboko were compared with those produced by the traditional method (TM). In MCM each washing cycle was followed by a centrifugation step for a more effective dewatering and removal of sarcoplasmic proteins (Sp-P). Kamaboko prepared from MCM was whiter and had significantly (p less than 0.05) improved textural characteristics (hardness and gel strength) than that from TM, AAM and PMM. Furthermore, SEM of surimi and kamaboko showed higher number of polygonal structure/mm2 in the gel matrix of MCM kamaboko, as a result of more cross-linking of the myofibrillar proteins, than that recorded for TM, AAM and PMM samples tested.      Finally, this study examined the effect of adding common carp sarcoplasmic proteins (Sp-P) on the gel characteristics of threadfin bream surimi and kamaboko. Based on the temperature sweep test, the depths of the valley in the G thermograph of the gels decreased as the concentration of added Sp-P increased from 5% to 35%. Storage modulus (G) of the gels showed greater elasticity in the samples with added Sp-P compared with the control samples without added Sp-P. Furthermore, the breaking force and breaking distance and consequently gel strength of the resultant kamaboko were improved, significantly (p less than 0.05) with added Sp-P. Thus, added Sp-P did not interfere with the gelling of myofibrillar proteins during sol-gel transition phase and was associated with textural quality enhancement for the resultant kamaboko. However, the addition of freeze-dried Sp-P from the dark muscle of the carp decreased the whiteness of the resultant surimi. Furthermore, the gel strength could not be associated with either  the number of polygonal structures/mm2 or the area of the polygonal structures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Common carp</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen peroxide</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">Texture</field><field name="subject">Rheology</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="subject">Alkaline-aided method</field><field name="subject">Sarcoplasmic proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081216.144930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Structural Integrity And Damage Tolerance Of Composite T-Joints in Naval Vessels</field><field name="creator">Dharmawan, Ferry</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the application of composite materials for marine structures and specifically naval vessels has been explored by investigating its damage criticality. The use of composite materials for Mine Counter Measure Vessels (MCMVs) was desirable, especially for producing material characteristics, such as light weight, corrosion resistance, design flexibility due to its anisotropic nature and most importantly stealth capability. The T-Joint structure, as the primary connection between the hull and bulkhead forms the focus of this research. The aim of the research was to determine the methodology to predict the damage criticality of the T-Joint under a pull-off tensile loading using FE (Finite Element) based fracture mechanics theory. The outcome of the research was that the Finite Element (FE) simulations were used in conjunction with fracture mechanics theory to determine the failure mechanism of the T-Joint in the presence of disbonds in the critical loca tion. It enables certain pre-emptive strengthening mechanisms or other preventive solutions to be made since the T-Joint responses can be predicted precisely. This knowledge contributes to the damage tolerance design methodology for ship structures, particularly in the T-Joint design. The results comparison between the VCCT (Virtual Crack Closure Technique) analysis and the experiment results showed that the VCCT is a dependable analytical method to predict the T-Joint failure mechanisms. It was capable of accurately determining the crack initiation and final fracture load. The maximum difference between the VCCT analysis with the experiment results was approximately 25% for the T-Joint with a horizontal disbond.  However, the application of the CTE (Crack Tip Element) method for the T-Joint displayed a huge discrepancy compared with the results (fracture toughness) obtained using the VCCT method, because the current T-Joint structure geometry did not meet the Classical Laminate Plate Theory (CLPT) criteria.  The minimum fracture toughness difference for both analytical methods was approximately 50%. However, it also has been tested that when the T-Joint structure geometry satisfied the CLPT criteria, the maximum fracture toughness discrepancy between both analytical methods was only approximately 10%. It was later discovered from the Griffith energy principle that the fracture toughness differences between both analytical methods were due to the material compliance difference as both analytical methods used different T-Joint structures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fracture</field><field name="subject">damage</field><field name="subject">criticality</field><field name="subject">Finite Element</field><field name="subject">Crack tip element</field><field name="subject">Virtual crack closure technique</field><field name="subject">Ship</field><field name="subject">T-Joint</field><field name="subject">Composite</field><field name="subject">Failure</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081216.163144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of nano-structured coatings containing aluminium, aluminium-nitride and carbon</field><field name="creator">Xiao, Xiaoling</field><field name="description">There is an every increasing need to develop more durable and higher performing coatings for use in a range of products including tools, devices and bio-implants.

Coatings consisting of combinations of aluminum (Al), aluminum nitride (AlN) and amorphous carbon (a-C) were investigated. Cathodic vacuum arc deposition and unbalanced magnetron sputtering were used to prepare the coatings. By varying the deposition conditions such as substrate bias and temperature, coatings with a variety of microstructures were formed.    A comprehensive range of analytical methods have been employed to investigate the stoichiometry and microstructure of the coatings. These include Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy, Auger Electron Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. In addition to the investigation of microstructure, the physical properties of the coatings were measured. Residual stress has been recognized as an important property in the study of thin film coatings since it can greatly affect the quality of the coatings. For this reason, residual stress has been extensively studied here. Hardness measurements were performed using a nano indentation system, which is sensitive to the mechanical properties of thin films.    This thesis undertook the most comprehensive investigation of the Al/AlN multilayer system. A major finding was the identification of the conditions under which layers or nanocomposite form in this system. A model was developed based on energetics and diffusion limited aggregation that is consistent with the experimental data. Multilayers of a-C and Al were also found to form nanocomposites. No hardness enhancement as a function of layer thickness or feature size was observed in either the Al/AlN or a-C/a-C systems. It was found that the most important factor which determines hardness is the intrinsic stress, with films of high compressive stress exhibiting the highest hardness.    Nano-structured multilayers of alternating high and low density a-C were investigated. For a-C multilayers prepared using two levels of DC bias, evidence of ion beam induced damage was observed at the interfaces of both the low and high density layers. In addition, the structure of the high density (ta-C, known as tetrahedral amorphous carbon) layers was found to be largely unchanged by annealing. These results extend our understanding of how a-C form from energetic ion beams and confirms the thermal stability of ta-C in a multilayer. This thesis also presented the first attempt to synthesis a-C multilayered films with a continuously varying DC bias in sinusoidal pattern. The resulting films were shown to have a structurally graded interface between layers and verified that ion energy and stress are the most important factors which determine the structure of a-C films.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nano-structured Coatings</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="subject">Al/AlN</field><field name="subject">Amorphous Carbon</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081217.100453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complementary Medicines in Hospitals - a Focus on Surgical Patients and Safety</field><field name="creator">Braun, Lesley Anne</field><field name="description">This study aimed to determine how CMs used by surgical patients are managed in   the hospital system by doctors and pharmacists and what patient and practitioner   influences affect this management.   Research design and method   Five systematic reviews were conducted to investigate the peer-reviewed literature for   information about Australians use of CM; overseas and Australian doctors and CM;   surgical patients use of CM and safety information about CMs in surgery as a basis to   design and conduct three surveys. Surveys of hospital doctors, pharmacists and   surgical patients were used to obtain measurement of people's attitudes, perceptions,   behaviours and usage of CMs. For healthcare practitioners, knowledge of   complementary medicines (CMs), past training, current practice and interest in future   practice of complementary therapies (CTs) and education was also investigated.   Approximately 50% of surgical patients reported taking CMs in the 2 weeks prior to   surgery and approximately 50% of these patients intended to continue use in hospital.   The most commonly used CMs were: fish oil supplements, multivitamins, vitamin C   and glucosamine supplements as well as some CMs considered to potentially   increase bleeding risk or induce drug interactions. It was not uncommon for CMs to   be used at the same time as prescription medicines.   Most surgical patients in general self-prescribe their CMs or have them   recommended by family and friends whereas medical practitioners were the main   prescribers to cardiac surgery patients. Nearly 60% of patients using CMs in the 2   weeks prior to admission did not tell hospital staff about use. The main reason for   non-disclosure was not being asked about use whereas fear of a negative response   was rarely a concern. The most common sources of information surgery patients   refer to were GPs, pharmacists and health food stores. Hospital doctors and   pharmacists did not routinely refer to information sources about CMs safety.   The majority of doctors and pharmacists did not routinely ask patients about CMs, or   record usage information. They had little training and knowledge of the evidence of   commonly used CMs and lacked confidence in dealing with CMs-related issues. Their   attitude to CMs is moderately negative and many are wary of safety, efficacy and   cost-effectiveness issues. The majority of practitioners considered some CTs as   potentially useful, particularly acupuncture, massage and meditation whereas the   medicinal CTs and chiropractic were considered potentially harmful. Most   practitioners were interested in future education about CMs and CTs and some would   consider practising CTs. Personal usage of CTs was low although there was   substantial interest in receiving future treatment.   Despite many strategically orientated initiatives developed in Australia to promote   evidence based medicine (EBM) and quality use of medicines (QUM), it appears that   CMs have been largely ignored and overlooked in the practice of Medicine and   Pharmacy within the hospital system. Furthermore, it appears that in regards to CMs   a 'don't ask, don't tell, don't know' culture exists within hospitals and that evidence   based patient-centred care and concordance is not being achieved and potentially   patient safety and wellbeing is being compromised.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complementary medicines</field><field name="subject">surgical patients</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">safety</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080414.115624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk assessment and determination of aristolochic acids and heavy metals in Chinese herbal medicines</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Thomas Pak Fai</field><field name="description">There is community concern about toxic contaminants in Chinese herbal medicines. The two areas of contamination that attract most attentions are the nephrotoxic chemical, aristolochic acids found to be present in some Chinese herbs and resulting in renal failure of over 200 patients in Belgium, and heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury and chromium, which can cause systemic, CNS, neurological and developmental pathologies. Currently there is a lack of systematic information about the aristolochic acid content in Aristolochia species and related genera, nor have there been any studies on metal contamination conducted in Australia which can provide some scientific basis for assessment of potential risk of Chinese herbal medicines posed to consumers in Australia.                This research aimed at addressing these concerns by firstly carrying out a systematic measurement of the contents of aristolochic acids in some relevant raw herbal medicines (CHM) and proprietary medicines (CPM)- 27 CHM, and 7 CPM, and secondly analysing the contents of five heavy metals in 100 CHM, 50 CPM, and 5 commonly used Chinese medicinal formulae (CMF) in the form of raw herbs, and finally evaluating the potential systemic metal toxicity caused by routine ingestions of Chinese medicines in the common form of encapsulated concentrated powder extracts formulated for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis by means of measuring the metal concentrations in blood collected from 71 patients in a randomised double-blind control clinical trial (RCT).                 Results showed that four of the 37 CHM and two of the 7 CPM contained the banned toxic aristolochic acids. Some of these contaminated medicines could still be purchased over-the-counter in Victoria. Quantitative screening of metal contamination in CHM found that metal concentrations were much lower in the aqueous solutions than in the acid-digested samples. Almost all CHM, CPM and the 5 CMF contained the five heavy metals. Contrary to popular perception, their metal concentrations in the clinically ingested form were extremely low. Their prescribed ingested contents calculated as percentages of the universally recognised regulatory safety standards, the WHO provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI), would produce only small percentages of the PTWI for the metal concerned. This was true even when the metal intakes from any forms of Chinese medicines were added to the normal Australian daily dietary metal exposure. These new approaches of analysing the aqueous extractions, as well as interpretation  with reference to the WHO regulatory standards and in combination with the Australian normal daily diet, are more relevant and realistic. The RCT in vivo study demonstrated no significant metal accumulation in the blood of both the real treatment group and the placebo control group, thus, attesting to the encouraging finding of the herbal medicine analysis.                 In conclusion, there is still much to improve in Australia in terms of enforcing the regulation of banning the sale of Chinese herbal medicines that might contain the highly nephrotoxic aristolochic acids. On the other hand, all forms of Chinese medicines in Victoria are safe, and do not appear to pose significant health concerns in terms of metal contamination.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aristolochia acids</field><field name="subject">heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Chinese medicine</field><field name="subject">regulatory dietary standards</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080414.145522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Centring the female: the articulation of female experience in the films   of Jane Campion.</field><field name="creator">French, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of female authorship that examines the feature films of Jane Campion in order to determine how her preoccupation with the cinematic articulation of  'female experience' is expressed in her films-whether female experience can be aestheticised, and to discover whether her gender can be discerned through the films of a woman director.      The exploration of these ideas entails a review of the feminist thinking, methodologies and epistemologies that are relevant to cinema, and that examine relevant theoretical positions within feminism and theories of cinematic authorship. The key lens employed here for theorising Campion's cinema is that of postmodern-feminism. As an approach, this allows an understanding of difference rather than 'Otherness', and an enquiry into gender that is neither essentialist nor constructionist, but facilitates critical thinking about both positions.       The central argument of this thesis is that Campion's film practice functions as an investigation into gender difference, how women and men live together in the world-experience that world, and are engendered as female through historic, psychological and cultural experiences. This thesis therefore argues that Campion's aesthetic and perspective is not only feminist, but also, female, and feminine, and her work a cinematic articulation of female experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jane Campion</field><field name="subject">female authorship</field><field name="subject">women in film</field><field name="subject">female aesthetics</field><field name="subject">postmodern-feminism</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">gender difference</field><field name="subject">female experience</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080417.165002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising salmonella to deliver heterologous vaccine antigen</field><field name="creator">Saxena, Manvendra</field><field name="description">Live attenuated Salmonella vectors provide a unique alternative in terms of antigen presentation by acting as a vector for heterologous antigens. The efficiency of any live bacterial vector rests with its ability to present sufficient foreign antigen to the human or animal immune system to initiate the desirable protective immune response.      Salmonella vectors encoding heterologous protective antigens can elicit the relevant immune responses, be it humoral, mucosal or cell-mediated. STM-1 is a Salmonella mutant developed by RMIT, harbours a mutation in the aroA gene that renders it attenuated, and is a well characterised vaccine strain currently in use to protect livestock against Salmonella infection. In previous work in this laboratory, STM1 was shown to be capable of eliciting immune responses in mice to plasmid-borne antigens.      In this study STM-1 was analysed for its ability to vector the model antigen chicken ovalbumin and test antigen C. jejuni major outer membrane protein using in vivo inducible promoters such as pagC and nirB from the plasmid location. The determination of the architecture around the lesion in STM-1 also allowed the development of constructs expressing heterologous antigen from the chromosome. The induction of immune responses, both humoral and cell mediated, was analysed. Another issue addressed in this study was effect of pre-existing immune responses in the animal host against the vector or related strains and the effects on generation of immune responses against the subsequently vectored antigen.      Humoral and cellular immune responses to vectored ovalbumin and C. jejuni Momp antigens were observed following vaccination with STM-1, when antigens were expressed from either the plasmid or chromosomal location. Up-regulation of immune responses, both humoral and cell mediated, was observed against the vectored antigens in animals which were pre-exposed to either the bacterial vector or related strains. These results indicate that STM-1 has the potential to be used as a vector to deliver heterologous vaccine antigens from a single copy gene in the field.      Lastly, the results from this study indicate that pre-existing immune responses against the bacterial vector or a related strain do in fact enhance both humoral and T cell responses against the heterologous antigen.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salmonella Typhimurium</field><field name="subject">Antigen delivery</field><field name="subject">in vivo inducible promoter</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080522.095907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of acoustic wave propagation within curved ducting systems</field><field name="creator">Furnell, G.

This toxic cyanobacteria is known to have caused death to domestic and wild animals and is recognised as dangerous to human health. N. spumigena causes harmful algal blooms in many parts of the world including Australia. The toxic solutes of N. spumigena are potentially dangerous when contact is made to contaminated water bodies or is ingested by primary consumers. In Australia blooms of N. spumigena are common in the Gippsland Lakes in South-eastern Victoria and cause socio - economic hardships to the local communities. This PhD investigates the toxic effects of N. spumigena and its solutes to a range of aquatic life. A method known as SPME - HPLC showed promise in environmental monitoring of N. spumigena toxins by measuring nodularin from water samples. Other research presented study into the lethal and sublethal effects of on an extract from N. spumigena to aquatic fauna. Resu lts showed the N. spumigena extract was not lethal to many aquatic fauna although zooplankton from the Gippsland Lakes showed mortality at environmental relevant levels. Biochemical studies focusing on animal detoxification and antioxidation enzymes and DNA integrity showed sublethal effects to the N. spumigena extract. Results presented in this thesis show that an extract of N. spumigena elicited detoxification and antioxidation responses in animals tested. Furthermore, the use of the COMET assay showed increased damage to DNA of animals tested. Results also showed that different organs in animals tested responded differently to the aqueous extract, suggesting mode of uptake maybe important in toxicosis. Further, feeding studies with N. spumigena help elucidate mode of uptake using enzyme response biomarkers. The overall results of this research provided an assessment of the toxic affects of N. spumigena on aquatic fauna with special reference to the Gippsland Lakes, Victoria, Australia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nodularia spumigena</field><field name="subject">nodularin</field><field name="subject">Gippsland Lakes</field><field name="subject">cyanotoxin</field><field name="subject">SPME</field><field name="subject">GST</field><field name="subject">GSH</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">detoxification enzymes</field><field name="subject">antioxidant enzymes</field><field name="subject">COMET assay</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080415.164533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of Executive Remuneration: Australian Evidence</field><field name="creator">Rankin, Michaela</field><field name="description">Corporate governance, and the role of executive pay in particular, has received increased attention from the media, government, and the business arena in recent years. The study reported in this thesis adds to our understanding of both the components and determinants of Australian remuneration packages for the top management team. It does so in four main ways:      1.	The study examines the determinants of compensation of a range of senior executives within the organisation, in addition to the CEO. No Australian research, to date, explores the structure and determinants of remuneration beyond the CEO;   2.	The research is conducted in a contemporary setting and timeframe, where corporations are subject to expanded disclosure requirements, when compared to the subjects of prior Australian research;   3.	It examines an expanded range of factors documented in overseas research as likely to relate to remuneration, some of which have not been previously examined in Australian work;   4.	Finally, in developing hypotheses concerning factors expected to relate to remuneration, the study reconciles the perspectives provided by both agency and managerial power theories in terms of how they present similar and differing propositions.      The research examines both cash and incentive components of executive compensation disclosed by a sample of top 300 Australian companies in 2005. The model incorporates measures of firm performance, economic characteristics, board monitoring and governance characteristics, and ownership characteristics in an attempt to explain the level of executive compensation. The study extends analysis beyond the CEO to incorporate an investigation of both the structure and determinants of compensation of the top five executives, in addition to the CEO.      Results indicate that the structure of CEO compensation has changed since prior Australian research was conducted, to include a more heavy reliance on incentive pay. In contrast to the US, the structure of CEO remuneration differs from that of non-CEO executives. As managers move progressively up the senior executive hierarchy, short-term cash bonus and share-based incentive pay both become more important as components of remuneration. There is also a greater reliance on performance hurdles than has been documented in prior Australian and international research.      The expectation that remuneration is now more strongly tied to firm performance is supported. The size and complexity of the firm are also considered to be important in determining the level of various components of both CEO and non-CEO executive compensation. This supports the view that larger, more complex entities attract higher quality executives, and pay for such quality and expertise. Growth firms are more likely to pay higher levels of incentive pay and total compensation to CEOs than non-growth firms.       Executive remuneration also relates to the strength of various monitoring and governance mechanisms, although to a greater extent for CEOs than for other senior executives. Managers are able to influence the remuneration-setting process where governance structures are weak, or where they have greater influence.       In some cases factors relating to CEO compensation differ from those associated with compensation of lower-level executives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Executive compensation</field><field name="subject">managerial power</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080812.140803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using positioning theory to understand how senior managers deal with sustainability</field><field name="creator">Boxer, Lionel John</field><field name="description">Social pressure for sustainability has become a significant factor in Australian business.  Made popular by a variety of diverse social movements that employ various tactics, sustainability is increasingly being debated in boardrooms and work areas of both large and small businesses.  In this research, sustainability issues are treated as a set of a wider range of obligatory and externally imposed (OEI) issues that are increasingly confronting contemporary business.  Of interest to this research is how senior managers deal with sustainability issues.      While some businesses excel in dealing with OEI issues, others prevaricate.  This research focuses on those businesses that appear to excel in resolving sustainability issues to explore how senior managers deal with sustainability issues. Such understanding is essential for contemporary practising senior managers, as it provides guidance for management behaviour that will enable sustainability and other OEI issues to be dealt with.      The author's effort to understand how senior managers deal with sustainability issues has led to the first business context application of Harr&#233;'s positioning theory.  A social constructionist approach, positioning theory is concerned with ordinary conversations, and presumes that these are the building blocks of all other discursive phenomena.  The resulting theory builds on positioning theory and provides a point of departure to conduct related research on other organizations that excel in dealing with OEI issues and those that prevaricate.       With positioning theory it has been shown that, in dealing with sustainability issues, senior managers engage in a range of positioning of themselves and others.  In doing so, power and knowledge have been considered in the light of Foucault's unique and penetrating concepts.  This has led to the proposed augmentation of positioning theory to include a concept of social flux, which is put forward as an indication of social order or culture.   Through this development, it has shown how senior managers confront opposition and reinforce support to enable them to achieve and preserve sustainability objectives.      In practical terms, senior managers alter four components of the social order to align the culture with the issues that need to be dealt with.  These components - rights, duties, morals and actions - are parameters that senior managers tune or level when they deal with sustainability issues.  When the social order is appropriately tuned or levelled, it is aligned with the issues that need to be dealt with.  That alignment enables issues to be resolved in a way appropriate for the organization.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">positioning theory</field><field name="subject">social construction</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">triple bottom line</field><field name="subject">obligatory and externally imposed</field><field name="subject">quality safety environment</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20081212.104859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Traditional Medicines on Textiles</field><field name="creator">Swarup, Ashish</field><field name="description">As science and technology has developed, the manner by which drugs can be delivered has grown. This research explores an alternative method for the delivery of therapeutic compounds to the body. The basis of the study involves the application of traditional medicines on textiles.

Experiments show that these creams were not suitable as a basis for applying to textile materials because the creams contain highly volatile compounds, which on drying the treated textile, post application, cause almost total loss of the B.S.E.

The biodegradation of this cellulosic material is achieved by   enzymatic activities of the cellulose degrading microorganisms. These   organisms usually express a complex extracellular or a membrane bound   cellulolytic system comprising combination of several cellulase enzymes.   Cellulases are the group of hydrolytic enzymes capable of hydrolysing   insoluble cellulose to glucose.   Phlebia gigantea is an aggressive white rot basidiomycete with   ability to tolerate resinous extracts on freshly cut wood and higher growth rate.   This helps the fungus to colonise the sapwood preventing other fungi from   becoming established. Early research on the cellulase system of this organism   reported the presence of a cellulase system composed of P-glucosidase,   endoglucanase and a cellobiohydrolase. Based on these unpublished studies,   our aim was to obtain a complete sequence of putative cellobiohydrolase I   (CbhI) from this organism. Attempts to identify and isolate the cellulase gene   resulted in an incomplete cDNA sequence of I 154 bp.   To understand the cellulase system, expression and regulation of the   cellulase enzymatic activity was examined for incubation of P. gigantea on   substrates glucose, xylose, Avicel, carboxymethyl cellulose and cellobiose.   The pH, total protein and biomass production results indicated that the   capacity of P. gigantea to degrade cellulose is dependent upon the nature of   the carbon source and the regulation of the cellulase synthesis is repressed in   the presence of simple sugars like glucose and xylose.   The study employed the highly effective method of purification by   affinity adsorption and purified cellulase complex in large quantity.   Characterisation of the kinetic properties of this cellulase complex revealed   that the rate of cellulase catalysis were optimum at pH 5.0 and temperature   50GC. The purified complex was comprised of multiple proteins and   demonstrated significant CMCase and CBHase activity on zymogram analysis.   The purified cellulase complex was characterised by 2D gel   electrophoresis and by peptide mass finger printing using MALDI-TOF massspectrometry   analysis. The 2D gel analysis of the purified cellulase complex   showed 15 spots within the range of pI 3.5 to pI 7 and the molecular weight   between 20KDa to 100KDa. Three protein spots were selected based on the   IEF and SDS zymogram and identified using MALDI-TOF MS analysis.   These proteins were identified based on the peptide mass data belonging to   the 6-phospho-a-glucosidase, p-glucosidase and glycosyl hydrolase family 13   a-amylase or pullulanases, suggesting the divergent evolution of specific   cellulase proteins.   This study showed P. gigantea as a potential cellulase source and the   cellulase complex secreted by the induction of substrate, comprises a variety of enzymes related to hydrolysis of cellulose biomass. It is evident from this   and previous studies that P. gigantea cellulase complex comprises of a   specific set of enzymes that possess the ability to degrade crystalline cellulose   and is one of the first organisms to colonise freshly cut wood. Further studies   on the cellulase system of this primary colonist may open up the prospects to   utilise this organism as the potential onsite bioreactor agent, pre-treating the   biomass and increasing the economic feasibility of the industrial bioenergy   processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phlebia gigantea</field><field name="subject">Cellulase</field><field name="subject">Affinity adsorption</field><field name="subject">MALDI-TOF MS</field><field name="subject">2D gel</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080513.150257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy Applied in Plant Physiology Studies</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xing</field><field name="description">Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a relatively new method applied to food quality assessment. EIS allows relatively inexpensive assessment, is fast, easy to operate and non-invasive. It has been adopted for investigation of fundamental electrical properties of plant tissues. Although the applications of EIS for food quality determination have been reported previously, the analytical relationships between electrical impedance properties and quality criteria have not yet been fully developed. Further exploration is thus important in acquiring more data on electrical impedance characteristics of fruits and vegetables and researching new approaches for determination of their quality.         This dissertation aims to investigate the electrical impedance properties of fruits and vegetables, and explore the relationship between impedance and quality criteria. In particular, the present dissertation outlines experimental research conducted on relationships between impedance properties and fruit tastes as well as the impedance changes observed during ripening process. Impedance measurement to monitor moisture content changes in the progress of drying is also included in this research.      In summary, the impedance properties have merits in fruits and vegetables quality assessment. The current used subjective visual inspection and assessment could be replaced by the EIS based approach as it is a more precise measurement of food quality.

However, the international environment includes business uncertainty in the form of exchange rate volatility as well as political and economic issues. Moreover, ongoing reduction of trade barriers is reversing the previous tendency to integrate business vertically, shifting international business schemes towards outsourcing all except what the company consider its core competence. Supply chain management is a strategic concept that considers the behavioural and political dimensions of conflict and dependence at the purchaser-supplier interface. Nevertheless, there is substantive ambiguity regarding its actual practice. Furthermore, although international purchasers are increasingly becoming more important, the purchasing si de of international trade remains largely ignored in empirical research.   This study focuses on understanding the complexity surrounding the commercial relationship between purchasing executives and foreign suppliers. The aim is to investigate what key factors are associated with uncertainty at the cross-national purchaser-supplier interface. Of interest to this research is how purchasing executives deal with those variables.   The literature review addresses the discussions of the constructs as it informs the development of hypotheses investigating patterns arising from their interactions. The result was a theoretically driven model addressing the complexity of the purchaser-supplier interface. A survey was conducted to collect data from the membership of a nation-wide professional body of Australian purchasing executives. The richness of the management reality was approached by having recourse to systems theory and the realism paradigm. The model was tested and discussed using structural equation modelling, the supply chain management literature and the responses and comments of the participating purchasing executives buying from over twenty countries.   xxii   The results include purchaser&#239;&#191;&#189;s perceptions regarding five latent variables and their concurrent interactions within the uncertainty surrounding international trade. The factors are culture affinity, the strength of the commercial relationship, quality reliability, ISO 9000 certification and the country of origin effect. Findings indicate that culture affinity is particularly important for purchasing executives and that it is a significant driver of the commercial relationship with foreign suppliers of manufacturing products. Nevertheless, culture affinity does not significantly influence perceptions of quality reliability. In contrast, commitment, cooperation and conflict management have a significant influence when assessing foreign supplier&#239;&#191;&#189;s quality reliability. Trust, traditionally seen as a social aspect of the commercial relationship, was found structurally embedded in the perceptions of quality reliability together with technical dimensions of quality. The commercial relationship between Australi an purchasing executives and foreign suppliers was found to have a high level of maturity. However, the purchasers showed no orientation towards commercial equity, and cooperation was found to be incomplete, overlooking working on cost optimisation. Further, a level of commercial partnership has not been established. It is suggested that a relational approach in the international supply chain is a necessary, but insufficient, condition to progress to the level of commercial partnerships.   The study shows that Australian purchasers&#239;&#191;&#189; perceptions regarding ISO 9000 are surrounded by controversy. However, the Standard is still considered a credible quality management system tool that enhances supplier&#239;&#191;&#189;s competitive position. Additionally, the majority of the Australian purchasing companies were not engaged in a low-cost country sourcing strategy. Overall, it can be said that the country of origin effect and ISO 9000 certification did not have a significant influence on quality perceptions within the context of an uncertain international environment.   By taking a multivariable and multidisciplinary perspective, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of mature commercial relationships in the international supply chain. The findings provide valuable information that assists organisations to tune or balance the supply management philosophy principles in the uncertainty associated with global trade.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">international supply chain management</field><field name="subject">uncertainty</field><field name="subject">supplier-purchase relationship</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="subject">culture affinity</field><field name="subject">country of origin effect</field><field name="subject">ISO 9000 certification</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20060314.162500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sequential Procedures for Nonparametric Kernel Regression</field><field name="creator">Dharmasena, Tibbotuwa Deniye Kankanamge Lasitha Sandamali</field><field name="description">In a nonparametric setting, the functional form of the relationship between the response variable and the associated predictor variables is unspecified; however it is assumed to be a smooth function. The main aim of nonparametric regression is to highlight an important structure in data without any assumptions about the shape of an underlying regression function. In regression, the random and fixed design models should be distinguished. Among the variety of nonparametric regression estimators currently in use, kernel type estimators are most popular. Kernel type estimators provide a flexible class of nonparametric procedures by estimating unknown function as a weighted average using a kernel function. The bandwidth which determines the influence of the kernel has to be adapted to any kernel type estimator. Our focus is on Nadaraya-Watson estimator and Local Linear estimator which belong to a class of kernel type regression estimators called local polynomial kerne l estimators.      A closely related problem is the determination of an appropriate sample size that would be required to achieve a desired confidence level of accuracy for the nonparametric regression estimators. Since sequential procedures allow an experimenter to make decisions based on the smallest number of observations without compromising accuracy, application of sequential procedures to a nonparametric regression model at a given point or series of points is considered. The motivation for using such procedures is: in many applications the quality of estimating an underlying regression function in a controlled experiment is paramount; thus, it is reasonable to invoke a sequential procedure of estimation that chooses a sample size based on recorded observations that guarantees a preassigned accuracy.      We have employed sequential techniques to develop a procedure for constructing a fixed-width confidence interval for the predicted value at a specific point of the independent variable. These fixed-width confidence intervals are developed using asymptotic properties of both Nadaraya-Watson and local linear kernel estimators of nonparametric kernel regression with data-driven bandwidths and studied for both fixed and random design contexts.  The sample sizes for a preset confidence coefficient are optimized using sequential procedures, namely two-stage procedure, modified two-stage procedure and purely sequential procedure. The proposed methodology is first tested by employing a large-scale simulation study. The performance of each kernel estimation method is assessed by comparing their coverage accuracy with corresponding preset confidence coefficients, proximity of computed sample sizes match up to optimal sample sizes and contrasting the estimated values obtained from the two nonparametric methods with act ual values at given series of design points of interest.      We also employed the symmetric bootstrap method which is considered as an alternative method of estimating properties of unknown distributions. Resampling is done from a suitably estimated residual distribution and utilizes the percentiles of the approximate distribution to construct confidence intervals for the curve at a set of given design points.  A methodology is developed for determining whether it is advantageous to use the symmetric bootstrap method to reduce the extent of oversampling that is normally known to plague Stein's two-stage sequential procedure. The procedure developed is validated using an extensive simulation study and we also explore the asymptotic properties of the relevant estimators.      Finally, application of our proposed sequential nonparametric kernel regression methods are made to some problems in software reliability and finance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sequential nonparametric kernel regression</field><field name="subject">Nadaraya-Watson estimator</field><field name="subject">Local linear estimator</field><field name="subject">local polynomial kernel estimators</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090119.134815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Greywater Systems: Barriers for Builders</field><field name="creator">Dinama, Desmond</field><field name="description">Australia is one of the driest continents in the world with changing climatic conditions continuing to put a strain on potable water sources. The use of water saving technologies such as greywater systems in residential properties is an important water conservation tool in order to reduce the consumption of the finite potable water resources in Australia.      To this end, Master Builders Association Victoria with the assistance of RMIT University investigated the current barriers that builders face with regard to the installation of greywater systems in residential properties. Builders like other property and construction professionals have a part to play in promoting the use of sustainable technologies.       The main aims of the project were to firstly find out or identify barriers that are inhibiting builders from installing greywater systems and secondly to identify and formulate strategies to reduce or eliminate the barriers identified.        The main barriers for builders are; high cost, government regulations, lack of builder awareness or knowledge, and low client demand. The potential solutions for the reduction or elimination of the barriers identified as part of the research include; economic and reliable greywater systems, creation of a website with link on greywater systems and educating the general public.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greywater; Water Reuse; Barriers for builders; Sustainable technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090119.142338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiated Transnationality: Memberships, Mobilities and the Student-Turned-Migrant Experience</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Shanthi</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploratory study of the lives and experiences of international students who apply for and gain permanent residency (PR) after completing tertiary study in Australia.        The thesis uses sociological theories and methods to focus on the ways that students-turned-migrants maintain transnational connections, and negotiate their memberships and sense of belonging across Australia and other countries.  This research is important because there is negligible extant literature that connects the international study experience and the skilled migration experience as two steps in the same process.  Furthermore, research that does address this phenomenon tends to look at students-turned-migrants as a 'policy problem', usually focusing on their labour market integration.  In contrast, this thesis foregrounds this distinctive group of contemporary migrants' subjective experience of the migration process and their ongoing transnational connections.      The research used cultural probes (packages of mixed media materials such as diaries, maps and disposable cameras, which participants used to document aspects of their lives) and in-depth interviews to provide a rich understanding of the multiplicity and breadth of participants' individual experiences, with various reflective representations of the individuals' narratives at the core of the study.      The analysis covers two aspects of the student-turned-migrant experience: the acquisition of memberships, such as PR and citizenship, and the maintenance of mobilities, including virtual mobility through media and communications technology, and corporeal mobility through forms of travel such as return visits.  The analysis reveals that students-turned-migrants undergo a distinct migration experience, characterised by three sequential gates of membership: their entrance as transient students, their acquisition of residency and their decisions about citizenship.  Transnational consciousness diffuses their decision-making at each stage of this process, as they negotiate the memberships available to them as a means to balance their desires and obligations across home and host countries.  The analysis reveals that student-turned-migrant choices and experiences are often affected by macro-political forces.  Choices about citizenship are heavily influenced by global regimes of mobility and the media, and their acqu isition of residency is negotiated through the institutions and regulations of the immigration regime.  The analysis also reveals that students-turned-migrants engage with a diverse range of transnational practices, many of which are closely grounded in the use of technology to maintain transnational connections.        The findings reframe students-turned-migrants as more than just a policy problem, but rather as a unique group of contemporary migrants, with several key features that set them apart from previous waves of Australian migrants.  While they are less integrated into established local ethnic communities, they maintain very strong connections overseas.  They maintain regular contact through virtual mobilities and display a high propensity for return travel.  They value mobility highly and display an acute awareness of both the advantages and challenges of sustaining mobile lives.  The study of their experiences not only reveals a great deal about the nature of transnationality and mobility in an increasingly globalised world, but also suggests that if this type of migration continues in the future, it may have implications for Australia's patterns of cultural diversity and international integration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">transnationalism</field><field name="subject">citizenship</field><field name="subject">mobility</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090119.143830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Reconstruction of Historical Jewellery and its Relevance as Contemporary Artefact.</field><field name="creator">Baines, Robert</field><field name="description">The dating of ancient jewellery is given by the archaeological context. Technology applied by the ancient goldsmith is traceable through archaeometallurgy. The aim of this research is to analyse historical jewellery and to construct copies based on the known technology of the era. Resultant laboratory constructions with their historical correctness and the new knowledge of jewellery structures will then be available for reworking to convey a contemporary visual relevance and a statement of history. The results of these analyses and reconstructions will form the basis of metalwork objects in which contemporary aesthetics are informed by historical practice. Jewellery offers a view into history, of cultural descriptions of stylistic, chemical and methodological correctness. For diagnostic purposes there is the expectation of an archaeological correctness within the fabric and manufacture of the jewellery object. From the vantage point of a contemporary goldsmith, t his has provided me with an arena for artistic interpretation-for 'play'. Historical jewellery becomes contemporary jewellery forms and the 'play' functions as a stumbling block and an upheaval within orthodox classification of authenticity. There is in this disturbance an intervention with coontemporary ephemeral materials into the jewellery artefact in which I manufacture a semblance of an identified 'correctness'. Jewellery remains in a better state of preservation when hidden or concealed-not exposed. The jewellery object once surfaced, discovered, excavated or plundered or even worn becomes part of our time for reworking. Knowledge and applications of technology become the vehicle for scrutinizing these objects. We live in an era where the ancient and the recent, the authentic and the bogus, have begun to mingle and interbreed in the corridors of hyperspace. Television stages Xena the Warrior Princess encountering the young Buddha in the entourage of King Arthur. Fakes with historical associations can s ometimes be considered authentic as a shroud of 'history' can encompass the object to the satisfaction of the naive connoisseur who wants to believe, wants to believe, wants to believe, wants to believe ... . Jewellery as document is available for interpretation-for'play'. There is potential to return to an imaginary history where ffictional detail has been confused with historic fact and this can be both intentional and unintentional. Jewellery of the past therefore exists in the present and the jewellery artefact becomes available for evaluation and for 'play'. In the analysing and categorizing of type, jewellery as vehicle conveying the past can become a mixture of one's own inventions and cultural inheritance. From the vantage point of a goldsmith, I am considering how formulated heritage is available for reference, questioning and modification. The option to copy, to replicate, or to modify the historic document jewellery is a possibility and new input can verify authenticity or engender falsehood throu gh the artistic reinterpretation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ancient jewellery</field><field name="subject">historical jewellery</field><field name="subject">archaeometallurgy</field><field name="subject">contemporary art jewellery</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20070419.153736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International market selection-screening technique: replacing intuition with a multidimensional framework to select a short-list of countries</field><field name="creator">Gould, Richard Robert</field><field name="description">The object of this research was to develop an international market screening methodology which selects highly attractive markets, allowing for the ranges in diversity amongst organisations, countries and products.      Conventional business thought is that, every two to five years, dynamic organisations which conduct business internationally should decide which additional foreign market or markets to next enter. If they are internationally inexperienced, this will be their first market; if they are experienced, it might be, say, their 100th market. How should each organisation select their next international market?      One previous attempt has been made to quantitatively test which decision variables, and what weights, should be used when choosing between the 230 countries of the world.   The literature indicate that a well-informed selection decision could consider over 150 variables that measure aspects of each foreign market's economic, political, legal, cultural,   technical and physical environments. Additionally, attributes of the organisation have not been considered when selecting the most attractive short-list of markets.      The findings presented in the dissertation are that 30 criteria accounted for 95 per cent of   variance at cross-classification rates of 95 per cent. The weights of each variable, and the   markets selected statistically as being the most attractive, were found to vary with the capabilities, goals and values of the organisation. This frequently means that different countries will be best for different organisations selling the same product.

Specifically, why these spectra have the shape and form that they do; what the significance of the material is in determining the shape and form of these spectra; what can be done with plasmon excited electrons; and how all of this fits in with the current theory of plasmon excitation.       In particular, the concept of plasmon scattering being an energy transfer process of a coupled wave in the material is explored. This gives rise to slightly different explanations of the plasmon scattering process to the status quo. Multiple scattering is typically pictured as a combination of separate and independent, elastic and inelastic scattering events interactively contributing to a final exit wave function. However, this investigation explores the idea of the elastic and inelastic components being a coupled event, and what the consequences of this idea are from a conceptual point of view. The energy transfer process itself, does not deviate from a virtual particle exchange description that is consistent with the standard model. However, the two significant points made throughout the chapters are one: that the elastic and inelastic scattering events are coupled rather than separate, and two: that each succussive higher order scattering event in multiple scattering scenarios, are dependant and connecte d rather than independent.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low loss plasmon electron energy loss spectrum</field><field name="subject">virtual particle exchange</field><field name="subject">scattering</field><field name="subject">exit wave function</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090212.143048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a Commercial Active Screen Plasma Nitriding System</field><field name="creator">Hubbard, Paul</field><field name="description">Nitriding is a plasma based processing technique that is used to improve the surface properties of components and products in many areas including the aerospace, automotive and biomedical industries to name a few.  Active Screen Plasma Nitriding (ASPN) is a relatively new nitriding technique which has potential advantages over the more traditional nitriding techniques such as Direct Current (DC) plasma nitriding where high substrate biases can be problematic.  However, there is considerable debate as to the mechanism for nitriding in ASPN.  This thesis focuses on investigating the mechanism for nitriding in a commercial ASPN system.        Commercial ASPN treatments of nitrideable alloy steels were found to be unsatisfactory unless a sufficient bias was applied.  The level of bias required to produce a satisfactory nitriding response, in terms of the cross sectional hardness, was found to depend on the concentration of strong alloy nitride forming elements present in the steel.      Although active screen material was found to be transferred to the workload, no evidence was found that this process played a significant role in enhancing the nitriding response.  The primary mechanism for nitrogen mass transfer in ASPN was found to be dependent on the active screen/workload separation distance.  When this separation is small (less than approximately 10cm for the conditions used in this study) then nitrogen mass transfer in the form of energetic ions or neutrals can occur between the active screen and the workload.  This allows samples to be treated without a substrate bias.  On the other hand, when the active screen/workload separation distance is large (greater than approximately 10cm) as is normally the case in a commercial environment, this mechanism for nitrogen mass transfer breaks down and a substrate bias is essential.  In this latter case, nitrogen ions attracted to the workload using a bias is the primary nitrogen mass transfer mechanism and the role of the active screen is primar ily to uniformly heat the workload.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nitriding</field><field name="subject">plasma</field><field name="subject">active screen</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090212.161932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Production of Power by Pure Rotary Means</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Barry</field><field name="description">The chapters subsequent to the design discussion   describe the evolution of the project.

RHA is produced when rice hulls are incinerated, for example, when they are used to power steam engines in rice milling plants. Typically, this ash is disposed of in landfill sites, which may cause environmental problems. RHA has a naturally occurring silica content that is very high, ranging from 95 to 98%. This high silica content makes RHA a potential filler for polymer products.   The aim of this project was to investigate the application of RHA as a filler in polypropylene. The study used a systematic approach to characterising the RHA physiochemical properties and comparing these to another commercially available grade of silica filler. The processing conditions for mixing RHA with Polypropylene (PP) were optimised to obtain the maximum tensile modulus value. Attempts were made to improve the interaction of RHA and PP by treating the RHA surface with silane coupling agents and adding functionalised polymers to the composite. Mechanical, rheological and morphological properties of the non-silanated, silanated and coupled composites were characterised and compared to determine their structure -property relationships.    Rice hull ash (RHA) has a similar chemical structure to other silicas.  Like any metals and metalloids, the surface of RHA contains -OH functional groups but these are very limited in quantity. RHA and PP composites have a wide processing window and the optimised processing conditions in a small batch mixer are 12 minutes, 60 rpm and 180&#176;C. Addition of RHA into PP increases the modulus but decreases the tensile strength of the composites, attributed to poor compatibility between RHA and PP, as RHA is hydrophilic and PP is hydrophobic. The optimum loading of RHA is 20wt%. To improve the RHA and PP composites, 2 grades of silane and maleic anhydride grafted PP (MAPP) is used.   Silane treated RHA composites have improved mechanical properties, especially tensile strength, attributed to enhanced interfacial interaction. The optimum is 1.5wt% for APS and 2.wt% for MPS in this system. The optimum MAPP concentration in this system is 3wt%.   Properties of the RHA / PP composites show modest improvements compared to PP. The properties are not sufficient to make RHA a commercially attractive reinforcing filler for PP for high performance composite. It has potential for a cost reduction filler for low end application composites.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silica</field><field name="subject">RHA</field><field name="subject">Composites</field><field name="subject">Mechanical properties</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090219.115140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Flexural Plate Wave Devices for Sensing Applications in Liquid Media</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Glenn Ian</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the author proposes and presents a novel simulation technique for the analysis of multilayered Flexural Plate Wave (FPW) devices based on the convergence of the Finite Element method (FEM) with classical Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) analysis techniques and related procedures. Excellent agreement has been obtained between the author's approach and other more conventional modelling techniques. Utilisation of the FEM allows the performance characteristics of a FPW structure to be critically investigated and refined before undertaking the costly task of fabrication. Based on a series of guidelines developed by the author, it is believed the proposed technique can also be applied to other acoustic wave devices. The modelling process developed is quite unique as it is independent of the problem geometry as verified by both two and three dimensional simulations. A critical review of FEM simulation parameters is presented and their effect on the frequency  domain response of a FPW transducer given. The technique is also capable of simultaneously modelling various second-order effects, such as triple transit, diffraction and electromagnetic feedthrough, which often requires the application of several different analysis methodologies.      To verify the results obtained by the author's novel approach, several commonly used numerical techniques are discussed and their limitations investigated. The author initially considers the Transmission Matrix method, where it is shown that an inherent numerical instability prevents solution convergence when applied to large frequency-thickness products and complex material properties which are characteristic of liquids. In addition the Stiffness Matrix method is investigated, which is shown to be unconditionally stable. Based on this technique, particle displacement profiles and mass sensitivity are presented for multilayered FPW structures and compared against simpler single layer devices commonly quoted in literature. Significant differences are found in mass sensitivity between single layer and multilayered structures. Frequency response characteristics of a FPW device are then explored via a spectral domain Green's function, which serves as a further verification technique of the author's novel analysi s procedure. Modifications to the spectral domain Green's function are discussed and implemented due to the change in solution geometry from SAW to FPW structures.      Using the developed techniques, an analysis is undertaken on the applicability of FPW devices for sensing applications in liquid media. Additions are made to both the Stiffness Matrix method and FEM to allow these techniques to accurately incorporate the influence of a liquid layer. The FEM based approach is then applied to obtain the frequency domain characteristics of a liquid loaded FPW structure, where promising results have been obtained. Displacement profiles are considered in liquid media, where it is shown that a tightly coupled Scholte wave exists that is deemed responsible for most reported liquid sensing results. The author concludes the theoretical analysis with an in-depth analysis of a FPW device when applied to density, viscosity and mass sensing applications in liquid media. It is shown that a single FPW device is potentially capable of discriminating between density and viscosity effects, which is typically a task that requires a complex and costly sensor array.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">FPW</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">Lamb Wave</field><field name="subject">Acoustic Wave Sensors</field><field name="subject">Liquid Media</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090219.120815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SPEED_SPACE Architecture, Landscape and Perceptual Horizons</field><field name="creator">Neille, Stephen Robert</field><field name="description">Developing a new spatial model for generating poetic intelligence in response to the already constructed and degrading landscape.   	The thesis has a simple inquiry: what innovative architectural spatial models can be developed within, or in response to, the townships and degraded land located along the Perth-Kalgoorlie water pipeline in Western Australia, to help instigate a new poetic intelligence when considering architectural making that has a direct relationship with the landscape that it exists within?    	The thesis begins and ends with a triad relationship between human perception, architectural idea making, and landscape: it begins with observation, engagement and recording and ends with a generative proposition. The thesis articulates how the complexities of a defined site can be recorded and modelled to bind disparate elements into being and therefore model more accurately the wholeness of perception that often drives architectural thinking.     	Commencing with the lens provided by the Perth-Kalgoorlie water pipeline, the thesis examines a domain in which architecture, landscape, and human action combine to activate our poetic intelligence. The thesis shows that we feel what we think we see, the visible power of man in nature and, the relentlessness of a middle distance that has been constructed around us.    	Through critical reflection a tremoring occurs, causing powerful new imaginings. The research attempts to visualise the new landscape and show that we help to degrade what we treasure. This moment or realisation can be framed as an aesthetic moment that causes us to think again. The research, formulated as a progressive, heightening of experience, leads the observer from Rambler's Gallery through commonplace territory pointing out observations along the way and then ultimately winds these commonplace observations together to construct a new presentation of the commonplace.   	The final exhibition announces a new spatial model for generating poetic intelligence in response to the already developed and degrading landscape. The exhibition creates a Speed_Space that posits and tests the essential theme of the research; it is an act of invention that creates new knowledge (the poetic intelligence). The common link between architecture and landscape in this thesis is that both are understood to have been significantly constructed by the human subject and, that this constructed landscape is a finite system and is all that we have.   	This thesis, through the evidence embodied in SPEED_SPACE offers a mechanism to demonstrate what gaining architectural experience is like; uncoiling into the world, observing, weakening, moving at the limit and then coiling up moments of experience, knowledge and perception to create a force of the imagination that generates new poetic intelligence as a result being in 'that' world. The new spatial model shows architectural experience, in response to the already constructed and degrading landscape, to be more like a self-made constellation acting as a force of imagination rather than a sequence of facts collected together.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Landscape</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Architectural experience</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090219.142507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation of Clay-dye pigment and its dispersion in polymers</field><field name="creator">Jamuna, Sivathasan</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with an experimental study of clay intercalation by organic dye molecule which is crucial for the successful development of a stable clay-dye pigment with combined advantages of organic dye and inorganic clay. Clay-dye pigments were prepared by two different methods. Two different organic dyes were used with unmodified clay and modified clay to study the intercalation. Characteristics of clay-dye pigment have been investigated using X-Ray Diffraction, Thermo-gravimetric Analysis and Transmission Electron Microscopy.       In this thesis it is shown that the absorption of cationic dye by unmodified clay in aqueous medium mainly takes place in the interlayer clay surface. More likely the dye molecules with aromatic quaternary ammonium cation intercalate the clay layer and strongly interacts with the clay interlayer oxygen plane, where solvent dye (which is hydrophobic in nature) adsorption by unmodified clay mainly takes place on outer surface of the clay. Dye molecules are weakly interacted with outer surface oxygen plane by hydrogen bonding or Vander Waals forces. Modified clay enabled the solvent dye to intercalate inside the clay interlayer surface with the suitable non-aqueous medium (because of its expanded structure). The modified clay suspension in the selected non-aqueous medium shows only partial desorption of alkyl ammonium molecule from the clay layer with the presence of both cationic dye and solvent dye. Therefore the penetrated dye molecules must have weakly interacted with the interlayer oxygen plane as well as  the remaining alkyl ammonium molecule present inside the clay layer. It is believed that the thermal and UV stability of organic dye can only be facilitated by a specific interaction (&#131;&#224;-interactions) between aromatic alkyl ammonium cation of organic dye molecule and the interlayer oxygen plane of clay minerals. This interaction possibly enables the high thermal energy or the energy of the UV radiation to transmit immediately into the clay layer. Therefore organic dye molecules are protected from high energy loading and hence thermal and UV stability are improved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clay-dye pigments</field><field name="subject">clay intercalation</field><field name="subject">X-Ray Diffraction</field><field name="subject">oxygen plane</field><field name="subject">&#131;&#224;-interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090219.160137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantics of Video Shots for Content-based Retrieval</field><field name="creator">Volkmer, Timo</field><field name="description">Content-based video retrieval research combines expertise from many different areas, such as signal processing, machine learning, pattern recognition, and computer vision. As video extends into both the spatial and the temporal domain, we require techniques for the temporal decomposition of footage so that specific content can be accessed. This content may then be semantically classified - ideally in an automated process - to enable filtering, browsing, and searching.   An important aspect that must be considered is that pictorial representation of information may be interpreted differently by individual users because it is less specific than its textual representation.   In this thesis, we address several fundamental issues of content-based video retrieval for effective handling of digital footage. Temporal segmentation, the common first step in handling digital video, is the decomposition of video streams into smaller, semantically coherent entities. This is usually performed by detecting the transitions that separate single camera takes. While abrupt transitions - cuts - can be detected relatively well with existing techniques, effective detection of gradual transitions remains difficult. We present our approach to temporal video segmentation, proposing a novel algorithm that evaluates sets of frames using a relatively simple histogram feature. Our technique has been shown to range among the best existing shot segmentation algorithms in large-scale evaluations.   The next step is semantic classification of each video segment to generate an index for content-based retrieval in video databases. Machine learning techniques can be applied effectively to classify video content. However, these techniques require manually classified examples for training before automatic classification of unseen content can be carried out.   Manually classifying training examples is not trivial because of the implied ambiguity of visual content. We propose an unsupervised learning approach based on latent class modelling in which we obtain multiple judgements per video shot and model the users' response behaviour over a large collection of shots. This technique yields a more generic classification of the visual content. Moreover, it enables the quality assessment of the classification, and maximises the number of training examples by resolving disagreement. We apply this approach to data from a large-scale, collaborative annotation effort and present ways to improve the effectiveness for manual annotation of visual content by better design and specification of the process.   Automatic speech recognition techniques along with semantic classification of video content can be used to implement video search using textual queries. This requires the application of text search techniques to video and the combination of different information sources. We explore several text-based query expansion techniques for speech-based video retrieval, and propose a fusion method to improve overall effectiveness. To combine both text and visual search approaches, we explore a fusion technique that combines spoken information and visual information using semantic keywords automatically assigned to the footage based on the visual content.   The techniques that we propose help to facilitate effective content-based video retrieval and highlight the importance of considering different user interpretations of visual content. This allows better understanding of video content and a more holistic approach to multimedia retrieval in the future.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Video retrieval</field><field name="subject">shot segmentation</field><field name="subject">video annotation</field><field name="subject">visual content modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090220.122213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved Cross-language Information Retrieval via Disambiguation and Vocabulary Discovery</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ying</field><field name="description">Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) allows people to find documents irrespective of the language used in the query or document. This thesis is concerned with the development of techniques to improve the effectiveness of Chinese-English CLIR.   In Chinese-English CLIR, the accuracy of dictionary-based query translation is limited by two major factors: translation ambiguity and the presence of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms. We explore alternative methods for translation disambiguation, and demonstrate new techniques based on a Markov model and the use of web documents as a corpus to provide context for disambiguation. This simple disambiguation technique has proved to be extremely robust and successful. Queries that seek topical information typically contain OOV terms that may not be found in a translation dictionary, leading to inappropriate translations and consequent poor retrieval performance. Our novel OOV term translation method is based on the Chinese authorial practice of including unfamiliar English terms in both languages. It automatically extracts correct translations from the web and can be applied to both Chinese-English and English-Chinese CLIR. Our OOV translation technique does not rely on prior segmentation and is thus free from seg mentation error. It leads to a significant improvement in CLIR effectiveness and can also be used to improve Chinese segmentation accuracy.   Good quality translation resources, especially bilingual dictionaries, are valuable resources for effective CLIR. We developed a system to facilitate construction of a large-scale translation lexicon of Chinese-English OOV terms using the web. Experimental results show that this method is reliable and of practical use in query translation. In addition, parallel corpora provide a rich source of translation information. We have also developed a system that uses multiple features to identify parallel texts via a k-nearest-neighbour classifier, to automatically collect high quality parallel Chinese-English corpora from the web. These two automatic web mining systems are highly reliable and easy to deploy. In this research, we provided new ways to acquire linguistic resources using multilingual content on the web. These linguistic resources not only improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Chinese-English cross-language web retrieval; but also have wider applications than CLIR.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross-language information retrieval</field><field name="subject">translation disambiguation</field><field name="subject">OOV translation</field><field name="subject">web mining</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090224.114940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hermes: Goal-Oriented Interactions for Intelligent Agents</field><field name="creator">Ho Mok Cheong, Dean Christopher</field><field name="description">Intelligent agents are goal-oriented software entities which exhibit a number of desirable characteristics, such as flexibility and robustness, which are suitable for complex, dynamic, and failure-prone environments.  However, these characteristics of individual agents are not exhibited by their interactions with each other since traditional approaches to interaction design are message-centric, and these message-centric approaches force the intelligent agents to follow prescribed message sequences in order to achieve their interactions, thus usually resulting in interactions which have limited flexibility and robustness.      In this thesis an alternative to the traditional message-centric interaction design approaches is presented.  In this approach, the interactions are designed based on interaction goals, and message sequences are not prescribed.  Instead, message sequences emerge from the interactions as the intelligent agents attempt to achieve the interaction goals.        The main contribution of this work is Hermes, a methodology for the design and implementation of goal-oriented interactions.  An important motivation for Hermes is to not only allow for the design and implementation of goal-oriented interactions, but to also be pragmatic and usable by practicing software engineers.  To that end, Hermes has a clear and guided design process with a notation explicitly created for the design of goal-oriented interactions.  Furthermore, Hermes, which covers the design and implementation of agent interactions only, has been integrated with Prometheus, a full agent system design methodology.  Guidelines for the integration are provided so that, in future, Hermes may also be integrated with other existing methodologies if desired.      Hermes also provides guidelines for mapping its design artifacts to an implementation.  As Hermes is goal-oriented, the implementation platform should be one that is goal-based.  The guidelines help developers map the design to skeleton code.  This contributes to the pragmatism of Hermes.      To further ensure that Hermes is pragmatic, two prototype software support tools have been developed.  The design support tool allows for the graphical design of Hermes artifacts and the implementation support tool produces skeleton code for the Jadex agent platform based on a structured textual representation of Hermes design artifacts.  Although only the Jadex agent platform is currently supported, the implementation tool can be extended to accommodate other goal-based agent platforms.      An empirical evaluation was carried out, and its results show that Hermes designs are significantly more flexible and robust than message-centric designs, although more time is required to design Hermes interactions.  This suggests that Hermes is suitable for interactions which are complex and/or error-prone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">methodology</field><field name="subject">intelligent agents</field><field name="subject">interaction</field><field name="subject">flexible</field><field name="subject">robust</field><field name="subject">goal-oriented</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090227.102654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antarctic landscapes in the souvenir and jewellery</field><field name="creator">Haydon, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Experience of Antarctica is unique and overwhelming and the phenomenon of the landscape and knowledge of its history continues to inspire artists and writers. Since Antarctica's discovery and exploration both before and during the Heroic Age; explorers, expeditioners, artists and writers have attempted to record and visualise Antarctica. In1982 international Antarctic programmes started to assist artists to travel to Antarctica with the intention of providing perceptive interpretations no longer attached to science or exploration. This practice-led research is the first project where a jeweller has explored and interpreted a personal experience of Antarctica to produce souvenir and jewellery objects. These objects reveal new interpretations of Antarctica that engage with the viewer through the recognisable personal jewellery and souvenir object.       This research has produced new contemporary souvenir and jewellery objects by interpreting both personal photographs and re-examining the historic stories, photographs and representations of Antarctica. The bibliographic investigations of historical jewellery and souvenirs provided specific examples of historical personal mementos that are now displayed in museums. This research analyses the meaning of historical examples of souvenirs and jewellery and examines the way in which photography has been manipulated and used on hard media. Through this analysis and examination of historical examples the research focuses on studio-based experimentation with enamelling and contemporary technologies to establish the links enamelling has had with micromosaics and miniature painting. This practice-led research investigates new and innovative ways to interpret these historical techniques and draw on the notion of the souvenir.   	   Thinking through the processes used in this research and retelling the personal experience of Antarctica, contemporary technologies are used to reimagine historical examples of tourist jewellery and personal souvenirs presenting a further understanding of Antarctica's significance both culturally and environmentally. The research not only provides an addition to the diverse range of interpretations of Antarctica it also explores the area of enamelling in contemporary jewellery and object making by contributing to the current revival of the tradition both locally and internationally. This research offers new experiences and knowledge through the investigation, experimentation, manufacture and installation of enamelled objects.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jewellery</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Object</field><field name="subject">Souvenir</field><field name="subject">Enamelling</field><field name="subject">Enamels</field><field name="subject">Silversmithing</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Jewellery</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090227.115157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Borya mirabilis steps in the recovery of a critically endangered Australian native plant</field><field name="creator">Reiter, Noushka Hedy</field><field name="description">Borya mirabilis is one of the world's most critically endangered plants. The research in this thesis has illuminated key aspects of: its reproductive biology; interspecies and intraspecies molecular relationships, mycorrhizal status, tissue culture potential and disease threats. Each of these aspects has fundamental management implications for the active management of B. mirabilis.      Floral observations of B. mirabilis and related species affirmed the uniqueness of the Boryaceae amongst the Asparagales. B. mirabilis had an unusually high number of floral abnormalities compared with other species of Borya observed. B. mirabilis is fly-pollinated. Pollen of Borya species showed little difference in the characteristics of mature pollen between species, with viable pollen being prolate and unicolpate with a single colpa-style aperture and a unique patterning of the pila. The structural immaturity of B. mirabilis pollen correlated with evidence from pollen growth experiments, where B. mirabilis pollen had extremely low germination rates, with those grains that did germinate being slow to do so and with slow-growing pollen tubes compared to those of fertile Borya species. Examination of the ovules of B. mirabilis showed that morphologically they were viable compared to viable Borya species. The field population of B. mirabilis was crossed, with one seed produced (the first recorded seed for th is species). Cross-pollination using the pollen of the closely related B. constricta and B. sphaerocephala with B. mirabilis ovules proved unsuccessful. Examination of the chromosome number of B. mirabilis showed that it had approximately 66 chromosomes and is probably hexaploid, relative to the diploid number of 26 in B. constricta. This may explain its low fertility.      Interspecies and intraspecies relationships of the Boryaceae and Borya mirabilis were investigated using sequences of chloroplast and nuclear DNA. The closest similarities to B. mirabilis were B. constricta and B. sphaerocephala. B. mirabilis may have emerged from alloploidy of these species in the past. Because of the consistent similarities of B. mirabilis and B. constricta chloroplast sequences, it is proposed that both shared a common ancestor with a chromosome number of 2n=22. A malfunction n meiosis may have resulted in ovules with 2n=44. The high similarity of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region DNA suggests that the nuclear DNA was derived from B. sphaerocephela. B. mirabilis may be an allopolyploid, from fertilisation of a diploid ovule of B. constricta with haploid pollen of B. sphaerocephala, resulting in a reproductively isolated polyploidy of low fertility. The wild population of B. mirabilis was determined to have a small amount of genetic variation. The genetic variation in the field population w as not fully reflected in the ex-situ population.       An effective means of micro-propagation of B. nitida for use in B. mirabilis has been established, providing an effective means of mass production of the species. The research has determined: a suitable explant (shoot tips) for regeneration; an effective means of reducing contamination in tissue culture (PPM); what medium is required to micro-propagate the species (LMHM); an appropriate gelling agent (Phytagel); and a practical method for inducing roots on the shoots grown in tissue culture.      B. mirabilis has been established as mycorrhizal. The predominant mycorrhizal association is a nodular arbuscular mycorrhiza, present in the form of coils in root nodules over wetter months and as spores in these nodules over dryer months. A significant increase in the health of the ex-situ population of B. mirabilis was recorded after addition of soil containing fine roots of the wild population. Of the plants associated with the wild population, Callitris rhomboidea had the most morphologically similar vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal relationship. But molecular identification was not achieved due to recalcitrance of DNA in PCR attempts.      Potential translocation sites for some of the ex-situ population of B. mirabilis were examined for Phytophthora infestation. Reid's Lookout and Mackey's Peak were infected with P. cinnamomi. Vegetation at Mackey's Peak displayed characteristic infection symptoms, resulted in isolates of P. cinnamomi from baiting and would directly receive runoff from both the walking track and the existing infested B .mirabilis site. At the Reid's Lookout site, both walking track and proposed translocation site were infested with P. cinnamomi, yet did not display the associated symptoms in the vegetation. The Pine Plantation translocation site was uninfected at the level of sampling undertaken. Its vegetation did not display any characteristic infection symptoms and was not isolated when soil samples were baited. It was therefore chosen for translocation and so far the plants are healthy and actively growing.      This research has provided critical knowledge to aid the recovery team in its current and future endeavours to manage this species and bring it back from the brink of extinction.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Borya</field><field name="subject">mirabilis</field><field name="subject">Boryaceae</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora</field><field name="subject">chromosomes</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">molecular phylogeny</field><field name="subject">tissue culture</field><field name="subject">mycorrhiza associations</field><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">floral biology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090227.160625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Diversity Strategies to Address Complex Operating Environments</field><field name="creator">Al-Mousa, Ahmad</field><field name="description">With the change in the economic structures of Western industrialised countries and the shift of traditional industries towards knowledge and services in recent decades the challenge to stay competitive in increasingly globalised culturally diverse markets continues to be a priority for organisations. Of central importance is the need to acknowledge, utilise and share the diversity of employees' knowledge, particularly tacit knowledge that is ethnically influenced, a resource that is enormously rich yet overlooked, undervalued and under-utilised in the employment market.   This PhD dissertation focuses on the implications of the knowledge era for how organisations manage their culturally diverse workforce. The purpose of the research is to explore the organisational strategies required for Australian businesses to support and encourage the development and sharing of knowledge between employees of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.   Arising from an extensive review of the literature on both Diversity and Knowledge Management, a framework for a holistic Diversity Knowledge Management/Sharing (D-KM/S) Strategy was developed.  This framework identified the need for organisations to develop a productive diversity management model that consists of a number of elements including a two-way communication strategy, training in cultural intelligence (CQ) and the development of opportunities for social networking through Communities of Practice. A four-phased process for the organisational journey towards a holistic D-KM/S Strategy was proposed. An initial audit of several Australian organisations recognised for their award-winning diversity management strategies confirmed the validity of this framework.      The framework was then used to underpin the qualitative interpretive case study of three of the organisations that had been part of the initial audit to determine to what extent these organisations had succeeded in progressing through these phases towards the final holistic D-KM/S Strategy. In so doing, the candidate also focused on the role of the Human Resources Department (traditionally responsible for implementing diversity policy within organisations) in implementing a more holistic approach.       From a comparison of the findings from the primary research the candidate concluded that while each organisation had progressed through several of the phases towards a holistic D-KM/S Strategy, they differed in their progress and none had as yet achieved the final phase. The study did identify two additional elements that require further research which relate to the potential of Information Technology to provide opportunities for social networking, and the potential of 'narrative' to be used to share culturally influenced stories.     The research concludes that the organisational strategies required for Australian businesses to support and encourage the development and sharing of knowledge between employees of different cultural and ethnic backgrounds includes: first, a productive diversity strategy that acknowledges both the explicit and tacit knowledge that a multicultural workforce brings to an organisation; and, second, processes that embed two-way communication opportunities for employees and managers, training in CQ for an increased number of managers and employees, greater support for social networking opportunities through Communities of Practice (supported by Information Technology tools), and encouragement of opportunities for employees to share cultural narratives. In addition, the thesis proposed an increased role for the Human Resources Department (working closely with line managers) in the achievement of a holistic D-KM/S Strategy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversity Management</field><field name="subject">Intercultural Communication</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Sharing</field><field name="subject">Tacit Knowledge</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090302.122501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image Retrieval using Automatic Region Tagging</field><field name="creator">Awg Iskandar, Dayang Nurfatimah</field><field name="description">The task of tagging, annotating or labelling image content automatically with semantic keywords is a challenging problem. To automatically tag images semantically based on the objects that they contain is essential for image retrieval. In addressing these problems, we explore the techniques developed to combine textual description of images with visual features, automatic region tagging and region-based ontology image retrieval. To evaluate the techniques, we use three corpora comprising: Lonely Planet travel guide articles with images, Wikipedia articles with images and Goats comic strips.       In searching for similar images or textual information specified in a query, we explore the unification of textual descriptions and visual features (such as colour and texture) of the images. We compare the effectiveness of using different retrieval similarity measures for the textual component. We also analyse the effectiveness of different visual features extracted from the images. We then investigate the best weight combination of using textual and visual features. Using the queries from the Multimedia Track of INEX 2005 and 2006, we found that the best weight combination significantly improves the effectiveness of the retrieval system.       Our findings suggest that image regions are better in capturing the semantics, since we can identify specific regions of interest in an image. In this context, we develop a technique to tag image regions with high-level semantics. This is done by combining several shape feature descriptors and colour, using an equal-weight linear combination. We experimentally compare this technique with more complex machine-learning algorithms, and show that the equal-weight linear combination of shape features is simpler and at least as effective as using a machine learning algorithm.      We focus on the synergy between ontology and image annotations with the aim of reducing the gap between image features and high-level semantics. Ontologies ease information retrieval. They are used to mine, interpret, and organise knowledge. An ontology may be seen as a knowledge base that can be used to improve the image retrieval process, and conversely keywords obtained from automatic tagging of image regions may be useful for creating an ontology. We engineer an ontology that surrogates concepts derived from image feature descriptors. We test the usability of the constructed ontology by querying the ontology via the Visual Ontology Query Interface, which has a formally specified grammar known as the Visual Ontology Query Language. We show that synergy between ontology and image annotations is possible and this method can reduce the gap between image features and high-level semantics by providing the relationships between objects in the image.       In this thesis, we conclude that suitable techniques for image retrieval include fusing text accompanying the images with visual features, automatic region tagging and using an ontology to enrich the semantic meaning of the tagged image regions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image retrieval</field><field name="subject">automatic region tagging</field><field name="subject">semantic gap</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090302.155704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Time Efficiency of Feedforward Neural Network Learning</field><field name="creator">Batbayar, Batsukh</field><field name="description">Feedforward neural networks have been widely studied and used in many applications in science and engineering. The training of this type of networks is mainly undertaken using the well-known backpropagation based learning algorithms. One major problem with this type of algorithms is the slow training convergence speed, which hinders their applications. In order to improve the training convergence speed of this type of algorithms, many researchers have developed different improvements and enhancements. However, the slow convergence problem has not been fully addressed.    This thesis makes several contributions by proposing new backpropagation learning algorithms based on the terminal attractor concept to improve the existing backpropagation learning algorithms such as the  gradient descent and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms. These new algorithms enable fast convergence both at a distance from and in a close range of the ideal weights.  In particular, a new fast convergence mechanism is proposed which is based on the fast terminal attractor concept. Comprehensive simulation studies are undertaken to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed backpropagataion algorithms with terminal attractors. Finally, three practical application cases of time series forecasting, character recognition and image interpolation are chosen to show the practicality and usefulness of the proposed learning algorithms with comprehensive comparative studies with existing algorithms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Backpropagation</field><field name="subject">Terminal attractor</field><field name="subject">Learning algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090303.114706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scanline calculation of radial influence for image processing</field><field name="creator">Ilbery, Peter William Mitchell, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Efficient methods for the calculation of radial influence are described and applied to two image processing problems, digital halftoning and mixed content image compression. The methods operate recursively on scanlines of image values, spreading intensity from scanline to scanline in  proportions approximating a Cauchy distribution.  For error diffusion halftoning, experiments show that this recursive scanline spreading provides an ideal pattern of distribution of error. Error diffusion using masks generated to provide this distribution of error alleviate error diffusion "worm" artifacts.  The recursive scanline by scanline application of a spreading filter and a complementary filter can be used to reconstruct an image from its horizontal and vertical pixel difference values. When combined with the use of a downsampled image the reconstruction is robust to incomplete and quantized pixel difference data. Such gradient field integration methods are described in detail proceeding from representation of images by gradient values along contours through to a variety of efficient algorithms.  Comparisons show that this form of gradient field integration by convolution provides reduced distortion compared to other high speed gradient integration methods. The reduced distortion can be attributed to success in approximating a radial pattern of influence. An approach to edge-based image compression is proposed using integration of gradient data along edge contours and regularly sampled low resolution image data. This edge-based image compression model is similar to previous sketch based image coding methods but allows a simple and efficient calculation of an edge-based approximation image.  A low complexity implementation of this approach to compression is described. The implementation extracts and represents gradient data along edge contours as pixel differences and calculates an approximate image by performing integration of pixel difference data by scanline convolution. The implementation was developed as a prototype for compression of mixed content image data in printing systems. Compression results are reported and strengths and weaknesses of the implementation are identified.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">integration</field><field name="subject">halftoning</field><field name="subject">image compression</field><field name="subject">image representation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of self-regulatory aids on autonomous study</field><field name="creator">Bednall, Timothy Colin, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis tested whether encouraging the use of self-regulatory learning strategies enhances the effectiveness of autonomous study for novices in a learning domain. Previous research and theory have suggested that high-achieving students are proficient at self-regulating their learning, and they do so using a range of learning strategies for planning their study, monitoring the effectiveness of their efforts and elaborating their knowledge. Information processing theories of instructional design suggest that learning is optimal when working memory load is managed effectively. Accordingly, methods have been devised for reducing load associated with unnecessary task requirements, as well as dedicating additional capacity to the construction and automation of knowledge schemas. Less is known, however, about instructional methods for encouraging self-regulatory learning strategies. Experiments 1, 2 and 4 examined the effect of encouraging participants to reflect on their understanding of topics they had been taught previously. Although these participants were able to accurately estimate their level of understanding in some situations, they failed to consistently use this knowledge to guide their study of topics they had previously understood poorly. In light of this finding, Experiments 3 and 5 examined the effect of encouraging participants to plan a free study period, with the direction to prioritise the topics that they had understood the least well. This intervention had a modest positive effect on post-test performance. Experiment 6 examined the effect of encouraging two elaborative strategies, namely explanation generation and summarisation. The former benefited performance, whereas the effectiveness of the latter depended on the comprehensiveness of the summaries produced by the participants. Finally, Experiment 7 examined the effect of providing broad-spectrum instruction in learning strategies, with minimal requirements to engage in specific strategies. This intervention resulted in an overall benefit to performance. Overall, the results of this dissertation suggest that certain instructional aids for self-regulation yield benefits to the autonomous study by domain novices without overburdening working memory.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer assisted instruction</field><field name="subject">Self-regulated learning</field><field name="subject">Cognitive processes</field><field name="subject">Learning strategies</field><field name="subject">Teaching methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stormwater heavy metal loadings to Port Jackson estuary NSW, Australia</field><field name="creator">Rochford, Louisa</field><field name="description">Master of Science</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stromwater, heavy metals, Port Jackson, estuary</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Participant Experience of the Service Learning Program at an Australian Catholic Boys&#8217; Secondary School</field><field name="creator">Price, Damien Faust</field><field name="description">This research explores participant experience of the Service Learning Program in the context of an Australian Catholic Boys&#8217; Secondary School. The research aims to explore what is happening as adolescent participants engage in working and relating with homeless people over an extended period of time. What are they learning? What sense or meaning are they making of their experiences, and are they deepening their value and belief system towards existential change? Service Learning is a curriculum initiative that Australian Secondary Schools are implementing to assist in the development of both the ethos of schools and in attempts to meet the needs of Twenty-first Century youth for a relevant education. While the benefits for participants in Service Learning are well documented, the effects upon recipients of the services provided, and whether the benefits for participants are the result of prior learning, family factors, or predispositions to this type of experiential learning, remain unclear. While Service Learning Programs are proving to be increasingly popular for school administrators, there appears to be a lack of clear models for Service Learning, its links to academic curriculum, or clearly articulated goals to assess success and achievement. A real danger of an adhoc approach to Service Learning in schools exists. The discussion of benefits to participants has not clearly identified links between program elements and hoped for benefits, nor has it examined the process or journey that participants have engaged in. Critical reflection on these issues has informed the purpose of this research and helped to shape the following research questions that focus the conduct of the study: Research Question One What features of the Service Learning Program at Holy Family College impact on participant experience? Research Question Two What changes are there in the meanings participants give to their experiences in the Service Learning Program over time? Research Question Three  How do participants perceive their Service Learning experience in terms of their personal world view and the world view promoted by the school? The theoretical framework for this study was that of Constructionism as the criteria for judging that neither &#8216;reality&#8217; nor &#8216;validity&#8217; are absolute; rather they are derived from community consensus of what is &#8216;real&#8217;, what is useful, and what has meaning. In exploring participants&#8217; experience as they served and related with homeless people &#8216;reality&#8217;, &#8216;usefulness&#8217; and &#8216;meaning&#8217; were derived from the student&#8217;s reflection upon their experience and their communal dialogue. Hence this study used Symbolic Interactionism as the perspective to explore experience. An interpretive approach was utilised, as humans interpret their environment, evaluate beliefs in terms of their usefulness in situations, select what they notice in every situation and focus on human action and interaction. A case study approach was used as it acknowledged the unique setting of a &#8216;van site&#8217; for homeless people. Using personal journaling and focus groups data was collected from fifty-three Year 11 students who had volunteered to participate on the van for a period of six months. All fifty-three participants in the Service Learning Program experienced particular phases regardless of prior service experience, variables linked to family or personality type. These phases were: Expectations, Exposure, Reframing, Disillusionment, Awareness and Agency. This study concluded that within these phases, participant experience was influenced by the length of time of the program, the presence of active mentors facilitating the experience, ongoing reflection upon experience and situating the experience in a clear ideological framework. While each participant experienced the phases mentioned above no two students derived the same meaning or level of meaning from their experiences. The research concluded that each participant will exit a Service Learning Program with varying levels of internalisation of the core values of the program. Some will exit with a surface appreciation of what the program was about; others deeper, others tacit; some will arrive at a point of existential change. While acknowledging the influence of family and personality factors in this journey, this research shows that the presence of active mentors, reflection upon experience, a clear ideological framework and a significant length of time to allow for the maturation of both reflection and experience will move participants further along towards existential change than would otherwise have occurred. A model; the Spiral Model of Service Learning is proposed to support these findings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Boys&#8217; Secondary Schools</field><field name="subject">Service Learning Program</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp192.04032009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and Cultural Transition in the Sinetron, Misteri Gunung Merapi</field><field name="creator">Habsari, Sri Kusumo</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT

This thesis offers a feminist cultural analysis of the popular Indonesian television serial (sinetron) Misteri Gunung Merapi (Mysteries of Mount Merapi). It investigates the television text in relation to its various contexts within the social and cultural transformations of contemporary Indonesia. Misteri Gunung Merapi has been produced since 1998, shortly after the financial crisis and the fall of the New Order regime. Since it was first broadcast by the Indosiar television station, it has ranked among the top-rating television programs in Indonesia, and I am interested in its success in this era of social transformation. The purpose of my study is to examine the significance of this success, including exploring the possibility that it is due to the serial&#146;s engagement with recent issues in contemporary Indonesian culture, in particular the changing roles of women.

The discussion falls into three main parts: a consideration of the contexts of socio-cultural change and the globalisation of the television industry within which the sinetron is produced; an examination of the way the sinetron draws on traditional theatrical performance, popular memory and supernatural belief; and a study of its representation of women and gender issues within the action-adventure genre to which it belongs.

In the context of the television industry, this sinetron&#146;s production signals the changing character of the industry, from state control to free market. In the socio-cultural context, as state control grew weaker and civil society flourished, the flow of globalization became more visible, foregrounding conflicts between Islamic and secular groups, often over the roles and representations of women.

As a sinetron kolosal-laga or epic, the series tells historical and legendary stories in such a way that they speak to contemporary Indonesia as it is in the process of reinventing itself. Misteri Gunung Merapi draws on the narrative and dramatic conventions of both traditional theatrical performance and internationally popular genres of action cinema; it constructs popular memory to raise issues about the present; and it employs popular fascination with the supernatural to invoke the mixture of spiritual traditions that has always characterised Javanese culture, in particular.

Focussing on the emergence of warrior women in film and television in both the Hollywood action-adventure and Kung Fu/wuxia genres, the thesis investigates the construction of female fighters on screen. I suggest that the sinetron does not share the same problems of gender representation that feminist criticism has identified in either of these genres. Four areas of analysis - heroism, body, power, and the camera - demonstrate that there is a different concept of gender in Indonesia which is illuminated in this sinetron&#146;s representations of women and gender issues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sinetron</field><field name="subject">feminist cultural studies</field><field name="subject">cultural transition</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">fighting woman</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090202.191832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of Burkholderia as biofertiliser on cereal productivity</field><field name="creator">Ben Mahmud, Merfat</field><field name="description">Biofertilisers are rhizosphere microorganisms inoculated to reduce the need for N or P fertiliser application and maximise plant growth and nutrition, resulting in greater grain yield and N or P content. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of diazotrophic bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat in Victoria, Australia. This thesis shows that N2-fixing Burkholderia species have great potential as biofertilisers on wheat productivity.      In Chapter 2, strains of bacteria were isolated from wheat-growing soils in main Victoria wheat belt at Horsham and Birchip in North West Victoria. Strains were identified as Burkholderia spp. by their closest matches in the 16S DNA and by morphology and physiology.        In Chapter 3, one selected strain from each of Birchip and Horsham were used to inoculate wheat in a pot trial in a glasshouse during winter-spring.  Soil was collected on site from wheat fields.  Pots were inoculated with these strains to evaluate the effects of Burkholderia inoculum as biofertiliser on the plant growth and yield.  Different nitrogen sources (urea 46% N and ammonium sulphate 21% N) were used as fertiliser at one of four levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N/ ha). There was a greater effect in Birchip than in Horsham soil and with ammonium sulphate than with urea due to waterlogying in Horsham soil.       In Chapter 4, field-grown wheat was inoculated with the same strains of Burkholderia.  Three experiments were carried out in plots at two sites, dryland and irrigated fields at Horsham and a dryland field at Birchip, during the winter wheat season of 2006, to evaluate the effect of Burkholderia species inoculum and different types of nitrogen source at one of four levels of added N (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N/ha) on wheat growth and yield.  The effects of both bacterial inoculation and N fertiliser on growth promotion and grain yield. Since 2006 was a year of drought, dry land crops were unsuccessful.  Grain %N as well as total N content in grain per area in the Horsham irrigated field increased with increasing N fertiliser levels up to 100 kg N/ha.        In Chapter 5, acetylene reduction (ARA) activity was measured in the pots for both inoculated and uninoculated plants at various growth stages and populations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with the wheat roots and bulk soil were measured in addition to biomass and N content of plants and grain. Molecular tracing using specific primers showed that the inoculum was present only in inoculated treatments.  Up to 60% of the increased N content of the grain in inoculated plants was potentially derived from nitrogen fixed by the inoculum in the rhizosphere.         It was concluded that the most significant result due to inoculation was the consistent maximal increase of N content in grain in inoculated treatments with ammonium sulphate fertiliser at 100 kg N/ha. Inoculation with Burkholderia consistently increased %N in wheat grain, with the potential benefit of decreasing the production cost and reducing use of chemical fertilisers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat grain</field><field name="subject">Inoculation with Burkholderia</field><field name="subject">N fertiliser</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090304.124323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Study of Structure and Barrier Properties of Biodegradable Nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Bhatia, Amita</field><field name="description">As nanocomposites provide considerable improvements in material properties, scientists and engineers are focussing on biodegradable nanocomposites having superior material properties as well as degradability. This thesis has investigated the properties of biodegradable nanocomposites of the aliphatic thermoplastic polyester, poly (lactide acid) (PLA) and the synthetic biodegradable polyester, poly (butylene succinate) (PBS). To enhance the properties of this blend, nanometer-sized clay particles, have been added to produce tertiary nanocomposite. High aspect ratio and surface area of clay provide significant improvement in structural, mechanical, thermal and barrier properties in comparison to the base polymer.          In this study, a series of PLA/PBS/layered silicate nanocomposites were produced by using a simple twin-screw extruder. PLA/PBS/Cloisite 30BX nanocomposites were prepared containing 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 wt% of C30BX clay, while PLA and PBS polymers compositions were fixed at a ratio of 80 to 20. This study also included the validation of a gas barrier model for these biodegradable nanocomposites.      WAXD indicated an exfoliated structure for nanocomposites having 1 and 3 wt% of clay, while predominantly development of intercalated structures was noticed for nanocomposites higher than 5 wt% of clay. However, TEM images confirmed a mixed morphology of intercalated and exfoliated structure for nanocomposite having 1 wt% of clay, while some clusters or agglomerated tactoids were detected for nanocomposites having more than 3 wt% of clay contents.       The percolation threshold region for these nanocomposites lied between 3-5 wt% of clay loadings. Liquid-like behaviour of PLA/PBS blends gradually changed to solid-like behaviour with the increase in concentration of clay. Shear viscosity for the nanocomposites decreased as shear rate increased, exhibiting shear thinning non-Newtonian behaviour.        Tensile strength and Young's modulus initially increased for nanocomposites of up to 3 wt% of clay but then decreased with the introduction of more clay. At high clay content (more than 3 wt%), clay particles tend to aggregate which causes microcracks at the interface of clay-polymer by lowering the polymer-clay interaction. Percentage elongation at break did not show any improvement with the addition of clay.    PLA/PBS blends were considered as immiscible with each other as two separate glass transition and melting temperatures were observed in modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) thermograms. MDSC showed that crystallinity of the nanocomposites was not much affected by the addition of clay and hence some compatibilizer is required.      Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the nanocomposite containing 3 wt% of clay demonstrated highest thermal stability compared to other nanocomposites. Decrease in thermal stability was noticed above 3 wt% clay; however the initial degradation temperature of nanocomposites with 5, 7 and 10 wt% of clay was higher than that of PLA/PBS blend alone.       Gas barrier property measurements were undertaken to investigate the transmission of oxygen gas and water vapours.  Oxygen barrier properties showed significant improvement with these nanocomposites, while that for water vapour modest improvement was observed.       By comparing the relative permeabilities obtained from the experiments and the model, it was concluded that PLA/PBS/clay nanocomposites validated the Bharadwaj model for up to 3 wt% of clay concentration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodegradable nanocomposites</field><field name="subject">poly (lactic acid)</field><field name="subject">poly (butylene succinate)</field><field name="subject">organoclay</field><field name="subject">morphological</field><field name="subject">rheological</field><field name="subject">thermal properties</field><field name="subject">mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">gas barrier properties</field><field name="subject">gas barrier model</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090304.143545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insights into gene interactions using computational methods for literature and sequence resources</field><field name="creator">Dameh, Mustafa</field><field name="description">At the beginning of this century many sequencing projects were finalised. As a result, overwhelming amount of literature and sequence data have been available to biologist via online bioinformatics databases. This biological data lead to better understanding of many organisms and have helped identify genes. However, there is still much to learn about the functions and interactions of genes. 
 This thesis is concerned with predicting gene interactions using two main online resources: biomedical literature and sequence data. The biomedical literature is used to explore and refine a text mining method, known as the "co-occurrence method", which is used to predict gene interactions. The sequence data are used in an analysis to predict an upper bound of the number of genes involved in gene interactions. 
 The co-occurrence method of text mining was extensively explored in this thesis. The effects of certain computational parameters on influencing the relevancy of documents in which two genes co-occur were critically examined. The results showed that indeed some computational parameters do have an impact on the outcome of the co-occurrence method, and if taken into consideration, can lead to better identification of documents that describe gene interactions. To explore the co-occurrence method of text mining, a prototype system was developed, and as a result, it contains unique functions that are not present in currently available text mining systems. 
 Sequence data were used to predict the upper bound of the number of genes involved in gene interactions within a tissue. A novel approach was undertaken that used an analysis of SAGE and EST sequence libraries using ecological estimation methods. The approach proves that the species accumulation theory used in ecology can be applied to tag libraries (SAGE or EST) to predict an upper bound to the number of mRNA transcript species in a tissue. 
 The novel computational analysis provided in this study can be used to extend the body of knowledge and insights relating to gene interactions and, hence, provide better understanding of genes and their functions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090109.095349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bone morphogenetic proteins are involved in controlling mammalian fertility</field><field name="creator">Young, Julia</field><field name="description">Transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#946;) superfamily members are involved in controlling mammalian fertility. The largest subset of the TGF&#946; superfamily are the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). BMP ligands signal through the type I and II BMP receptors and utilise the Smads1/5/8 phosphorylation cascade to control gene expression in the cell nucleus. Although BMPs act through the same pathway, they have the ability to activate unique sets of genes dependant on the identity of the ligand. In this study, HEK293T cells were challenged with BMP ligands for four hours and gene expression profiles were compared using microarray technology. The genes upregulated in the presence of BMP2, BMP4, BMP6 and BMP7 play roles in cellular proliferation and differentiation. These functions are critical stages in the successful development of an ovarian follicle whilst undergoing folliculogenesis. All of the BMP ligands investigated in this study were also observed to upregulate the expression of a small group of common genes indicating that a shared regulatory pattern occurs within the BMP pathway. Of these genes, Smad6 and Smad7, inhibitor of DNA binding proteins 1-4 (ID 1-4), and msh homeobox homolog 2 (MSX2) were previously known BMP target genes. However, none of the remaining genes upregulated by all BMPs were previously shown to be BMP targets. 
 The results from the microarray experiment were used as founding data for the in silico mining of novel genes not present on the array that may be differentially expressed in response to these ligands. The expression levels of several of the novel genes identified by in silico mining were then measured in vitro, however the results showed no differential expression in the HEK293T cells. 
 To apply the knowledge of the microarray studies to the tissue of interest, eight genes were selected for assessment in ovine granulosa cells. Four of the genes upregulated in response to BMP6 in HEK293T cells were also differentially expressed in primary ovine granulosa cell cultures in response to BMP6 addition. 
 The identification of several sheep breeds with mutations in TGF&#946; superfamily members has enabled investigations into the roles that specific TGF&#946; components play in controlling fertility. The highly fertile Booroola sheep has a substitution mutation in the type IB BMP receptor that results in an additive effect on ovulation rate. The Booroola mutation causes precocious maturation of ovarian follicles with fewer granulosa cells surrounding an enlarged oocyte, and carriers of the mutation have higher levels of circulating follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). BMPs have previously been shown to influence the regulation of FSH synthesis and secretion in the pituitary gland. In this study, primary pituitary cells were harvested and cultured from homozygous Booroola ewes and from wildtype ewes to determine if the mutation caused alterations in FSH secretion in vitro. The cells were collected 24 h following induction of luteolysis and cultured for 72 h prior to being challenged for 24 h with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP2, BMP4, BMP6), growth and differentiation factor-9 (GDF9), transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#946;1), activin-A and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). The levels of FSH and luteinising hormone (LH) were measured by radioimmunoassay and compared to the untreated controls. Primary pituitary cell cultures from Booroola ewes secreted less FSH than wildtype cells in the presence of BMP2, BMP4 and BMP6. These BMPs did not affect the FSH stores within the cells, or the levels of LH released. GDF9 appeared to act in a BMP-like manner by suppressing FSH secretion. The BMPRIB receptor however, was not found to co-localise with gonadotroph cells in either Booroola or wildtype pituitary tissues. These findings imply that the increased sensitivity of Booroola cells to BMP2, BMP4, BMP6, and GDF9 cannot be due to the direct action of the BMPRIB mutant Booroola receptor in the cells that synthesize FSH. The alternative type I BMP receptor to BMPRIB that can act in BMP signal transduction is BMPRIA. This receptor was also not found in gonadotroph cells of wildtype orBooroola ewes This is in contrast to findings in other flocks which have been shown to express BMPRIA in gonadotroph cells. 
 This study has identified unique sets of differentially regulated genes in response to BMP-2, 4, 6, and 7 as well as TGF&#946;1 in a human HEK293T cell culture system. Among the differentially expressed genes, a common set of 12 genes were upregulated by all BMP ligands. None of these genes were present in the TGF&#946;1 set. Selected genes were validated in ovine primary granulosa cell cultures, showing that the human cell culture system functions similarly to cells of biologial relevance in fertility. Within the pituitary gland, BMPs are shown to influence FSH secretion. The presence of the Booroola mutation enhances the BMP effects on gonadotroph cells, however the lack of BMPRIB on gonadotroph cells indicates that the effects are indirect.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone morphogenetic proteins</field><field name="subject">fertility</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090112.122706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol mannans and their analogues</field><field name="creator">Ainge, Gary D</field><field name="description">Phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) isolated from mycobacteria have been identified as an important class of glycolipids that possess significant immune modulating properties. To provide discrete synthetic compounds for biological assay, this thesis describes the syntheses of three PIM molecules, namely dipalmitoyl PIM2 (12), PIM4 (84), and PIM6 (108), and two PIM2 analogues designed for increased stability, PIM2ME (147) and PIM2MA (148). 
 The synthesis of all of these molecules involved mannosylation of 1-O-allyl-3,4,5-tri-O-benzyl-D-myo-inositol (22), which was prepared from methyl &#945;-D-glucopyranoside in 8% yield over 8 steps, using a Ferrier reaction strategy. 
 A common intermediate, 3,4,5-tri-O-benzyl-2,6-di-O-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-D-myo-inositol (9), was used for the syntheses of 12, 147, and 148. This compound was prepared by bis-mannosylation of the C-1 and C-6 hydroxyl groups of 22 with 2-O-acetyl-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (63) to give, after protecting group manipulations, the &#945;,&#945;-pseudo-trisaccharide 9 in 37% over 4 steps. The selectivity of the desired &#945;,&#945;-product was found to be increased by the selection of Et&#8322;O as the solvent for the glycosylation reaction. 
 The C-1 hydroxyl group of 9 was coupled to benzyl (1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero)-diisopropylphosphoramidite (28) using 1H-tetrazole. Global debenzylation of the resulting product gave PIM2 (12) in 23% yield over 6 steps from 22. In a similar fashion 9 was coupled to 1-O-hexadeconyl-2-O-hexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-O-benzyl-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite (156), and subsequent deprotection gave PIM2ME (147) in 30% yield over 2 steps from 9. Coupling of 9 with 2-deoxy-1-O-hexadeconyl-2-O-hexadeconylamino-sn-glycero-3-O-benzyl-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite (172) and subsequent deprotection gave PIM2MA (148) in 47% yield over 2 steps from 9. 
 A modified approach was required for the syntheses of PIM4 (84) and PIM6 (108). A selective glycosylation of the C-6 hydroxyl of 22 with an orthogonally protected mannose donor would allow extension of the manno-oligosaccharide in a 2+3 or 4+3 glycosylation strategy required to build the pseudo-pentasaccharide or pseudo-heptasaccharide core of 84 or 108 respectively. 
 Sequential mannosylation of 22, firstly at the more reactive C-6 hydroxyl, with 2-O-acetyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-6-O-tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (85), was followed by mannosylation at the C-2 hydroxyl with 63. Removal of the silyl protecting group followed by a 2+3 coupling with the dimannoside donor, 2-O-acetyl-6-O-(2-O-acetyl-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-3,4-di-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (95), gave a pseudo-pentasaccharide intermediate. Protecting group manipulations followed by coupling of the of the C-1 hydroxyl group of the inositol ring to phosphoramidite 28, and a global debenzylation, gave PIM4 (84) in 6% yield over 9 steps from 22. 
 During the synthesis of PIM6 (108), thioglycosylation chemistry was explored and found to be comparable to reactions with trichloroacetimidate donors. Similar methodology was used for the synthesis of PIM6 (108) as had previously been carried out for the synthesis of PIM4 (84). Mannosylation at the more reactive C-6 hydroxyl of 22 with either phenyl 2-O-benzoyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-6-O-triisopropylsilyl-1-thio-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (112) or 2-O-benzoyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-6-O-triisopropylsilyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (113), was followed by mannosylation at the C-2 hydroxyl with 63. Removal of the silyl group followed by a 4+3 coupling with either of the tetramannoside donors, phenyl (2-O-benzoyl-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1[to]2)-(3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1[to]2)-(3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1[to]6)-2-O-benzoyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-1-thio-&#945;-D-mannopyranoside (109) or (2-O-benzoyl-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1[to]2)- (3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl)-(1[to]2)-(3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-mannopyranosyl-(1[to]6)-2-O-benzoyl-3,4-di-O-benzyl-&#945;-D-marmopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate (131) gave a gave a pseudo-heptasaccharide intermediate. Protecting group manipulations followed by coupling of the of the C-1 hydroxyl group of the inositol ring to phosphoramidite 28, and a global debenzylation, gave PIM6 (108) in 9% yield over 9 steps from 22. To aid characterisation of 108, a sample was deacylated to afford dPIM6 (144) which gave the same spectral data as a sample from a natural source. 
 The compounds PIM2 (12), PIM4 (84), PIM2ME (147), and PIM2MA (148) were assayed for adjuvant activity and were found to have comparable activity to fractions isolated from natural sources. The analogue PIM2ME (147) gave the best results and is currently undergoing further development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phosphoinositides</field><field name="subject">bacterial cell walls</field><field name="subject">glycosides</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090113.101325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Methods for Integrating Broadband Microstrip Patch Antennas</field><field name="creator">Elmezughi, Abdurrezagh</field><field name="description">The use of the microstrip antenna has grown rapidly for the last two decades, because of the increasing demand for a low profile antenna with small size, low cost, and high performance over a large spectrum of frequencies.  However, despite the advantages microstrip antennas provide, a number of technical challenges remain to be solved for microstrip antennas to reach their full potential, particularly if they are to be interfaced with monolithic circuits.       The objective of this thesis is to examine novel methods for integrating and constructing broadband microstrip antennas, particularly at high microwave and millimeter wave frequencies where dimensions get very small and fabrication tolerances are critical.       The first stage of the thesis investigates techniques to reduce the spurious feed radiation and surface wave generation from edge-fed patch antennas.  A technique to reduce the spurious radiation from the edge-fed patch antenna by using a dielectric filled cavity behind the radiating element is explored.  From this, a single element edge-fed cavity backed patch antenna was developed.  Measured results showed low levels of cross polarization, making it suitable for dual or circular polarization applications.  A 2 x 2 edge-fed cavity backed patch antenna array was also developed, which benefited greatly from this new technique due to the extensive feed network required.        Furthermore, investigation into edge-fed cavity backed patches on high dielectric materials was also conducted.  The measured impedance bandwidth of this edge-fed cavity backed patch is three times greater than the conventional edge-fed patch, and the gain increases to 5.1 dBi compared to 3.6 dBi.  Further bandwidth enhancement of the single element edge-fed cavity backed antenna on high dielectric material was achieved by applying the hi-lo substrate structure.  The hi-lo substrate structure produced an increase in the bandwidth to 26% from the 1.7% of the single element edge-fed cavity backed patch, while maintaining pattern integrity and radiation efficiency.       Next, the development of a flip-chip bonding technique was investigated to enhance the fabrication accuracy and robustness of multilayer antennas on high dielectric materials.  This technique was proven through simulation and experiment to provide good impedance and radiation performance via the high accuracy placement of the superstrate layer.  The single element flip-chip patch antenna uses a high dielectric constant material for both the base and the patch superstrate, whereas the stacked flip-chip patch again uses a high and low permittivity material combination to achieve efficient wideband performance.  Due to the high permittivity feed material, these antennas display the attributes required for integration with MMICs.  The measured 10 dB return loss bandwidth of the single element was 4% with a gain of 4.6 dBi, whereas the stacked flip-chip patch showed very broadband performance, with a bandwidth of 23% with a gain of 8.5 dBi.  The high accuracy placement and rigid attachment of the upper superstrat e layer via the flip-chip bonding technique also enables these antennas to be scaled up to millimeter-wave operational frequencies.      The final section of this thesis is focused on developing a fabrication technique to enable the creation of a low permittivity layer at a nominated thickness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broadband microstrip antenna</field><field name="subject">high dielectric materials</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090305.093332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of Petaloid Base Dimensions and Process Operating Conditions to Minimize Environmental Stress Cracking in Injection Stretch Blow Moulded PET Bottles</field><field name="creator">Demirel, Bilal</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT   Injection stretch blow moulded PET bottles are the most widely used container type for carbonated soft drinks. PET offers excellent clarity, good mechanical and barrier properties, and ease of processing. Typically, these bottles have a petaloid-shaped base, which gives good stability to the bottle and it is the most appropriate one for beverage storage. However, the base is prone to environmentally induced stress cracking and this a major concern to bottle manufacturers.       The object of this study is to explain the occurrence of stress cracking, and to prevent it by optimising both the geometry of the petaloid base and the processing parameters during bottle moulding.       A finite element model of the petaloid shape is developed in CATIA V5 R14, and used to predict the von Mises stress in the bottle base for different combinations of three key dimensions of the base: foot length, valley width, and clearance. The combination of dimensions giving the minimum stress is found by a statistical analysis approach using an optimisation and design of experiments software package ECHIP-7.      A bottle mould was manufactured according to the optimum base geometry and PET bottles are produced by injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM).  In order to minimise the stresses at the bottom of the bottle, the ISBM process parameters were reviewed and the effects of both the stretch rod movement and the temperature profile of the preform were studied by means of the process simulation software package (Blow View version 8.2). Simulated values of the wall thickness, stress, crystallinity, molecular orientation and biaxial ratio in the bottle base were obtained. The process parameters, which result in low stress and uniform material in the bottle base, are regarded as optimum operating conditions.       In the evaluation process of the optimum bottle base, bottles with standard (current) and optimized (new) base were produced under the same process conditions via a two-stage ISBM machine. In order to compare both the bottles, environmental stress crack resistance, top load strength, burst pressure strength, thermal stability test as well as crystallinity studies &#172;&#172;&#172;via modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) and morphology studies via environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and optical microscopy were conducted.       In this study carried out, the new PET bottle with the optimised base significantly decreased the environmental stress cracking occurrence in the bottom of the bottle. It is found that the bottle with optimised base is stronger than the bottle with standard base against environmental stress cracking. The resistance time against environmental stress cracking are increased by about % 90 under the same operating process conditions used for standard (current) bottles; and by % 170 under the optimised process conditions where the preform re-heating temperature is set to 105 oC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PET</field><field name="subject">stress cracking</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">injection stretch blow moulding</field><field name="subject">bottle</field><field name="subject">crystallinity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090305.154433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Brm, Brg-1, Snail 1 and Snail 2 in the Progression of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer</field><field name="creator">Bock, Vanessa Leonie</field><field name="description">Master of Medicine</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">skin cancer</field><field name="subject">Brm</field><field name="subject">Brg-1</field><field name="subject">chromatin-remodelling</field><field name="subject">carcinogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory of Real Estate Valuation</field><field name="creator">Lawson, John</field><field name="description">It can be stated that where a valuation is used as an assessment of risk there is no research-backed theory of valuation, that is one that explains the methodology used and is validated by a hypothesis. The significance of this thesis is the recognition of the ignorance, and confusion that exists and the need of a theory to explain methodology verified by a hypothesis or hypotheses.     This thesis is the result of systemic research in an attempt to define the confusion that exists, resulting from the application of inappropriate economic theories in valuation. This research also attempts to find the reason for and the source of the confusion.    This research supports that which has previously been advocated that valuation principles of valuation Practice must be underpinned by a working theory embedded in positive economics. The finding of this paper is that price theory is an appropriate proxy for valuation theory where a valuation is used as an assessment of the recovery of funds. However importantly this research also recognises and examines the possible ability of other related economic theories to explain areas price behaviour where price theory cannot.    The findings of this research are likely to have important implications in the valuation profession. Hopefully this will result in stimulating debate and a realisation of a need for a theory which supports a credible and validated process of valuation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real estate</field><field name="subject">valuation</field><field name="subject">risk</field><field name="subject">price theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090306.125134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light and Illusion</field><field name="creator">Lincoln, Lucy</field><field name="description">This project is an investigation of visual illusions created through the interaction of light on different surfaces and structures. Illusion implies deception - an optical illusion, in a sense is misunderstood information that creates a 'false' visual reality.   This project incorporates macro and non-macro photography to generate illusion through scale and shape. Through deliberate acts of deception the images play on the human desire for mystery. It is through the 'eye of the imagination' that the images reveal themselves. The photographic images are of dioramas created on the top of a light box, using everyday substances and materials such as glass, felt, coloured transparencies, detergents and liquids of varying consistencies. This project reveals the extraordinary in the ordinary. The outcome of this project is a photographic body of work, the product of my experimentation and research, in which the ambiguous content of the composition, compels the viewer to their own interpretation. Translating some of the resulting images into a three-dimensional light based installation of an illusory nature invites people to take on a participatory role, furthering their experience with the artwork.

At present, 87% of the land is held under customary laws. Almost all (some 99%) of the land held under customary law is not surveyed, recorded or registered to the tribes. Customary land disputes have been inhibiting rural development initiatives, which is partly responsible for the ill-being of the people. The Family Tree Approach (FTA) is a process being used within the To'abaita region of the Malaita Province to help address problems in the dilemmas of land ownership, land disputes, land recording, land registration and rural development in land held under customary laws in To&#8217;abaita. The FTA is a blend of indigenous epistemology, modern practices and Christian principles. Indigenously, the tribes identify with their land by tracing their origins through genealogies, historical narrations, tribal epics and chants, shrines and properties. Rev. Michael Maelia&#8217;u, a Church Minister and a former Parliamentarian, promotes the FTA. The FTA has four pillars (principles) &#8211; recognition, reconciliation, recording and registration &#8211; which are covered within five sequential phases. For instance, recognition is done in phase one of the process, enabling all members of a tribe to recognize each other. Reconciliation is part of the process, promoting forgiveness and acceptance of tribal members. Recording is an important pillar of the FTA, as its role is to produce documents that will be accepted by the law. Research results show that land registration is also a pillar of the FTA; once customary land is registered to the tribes, land disputes will be resolved, thereby enabling sustainable rural development that improves the people&#8217;s well-being. The FTA, however, is currently not formally recognized in the country. It has been used by 12 of approximately 20 tribes within the To'abaita region. Some of the To'abaita tribes have not adopted the FTA for various reasons. The FTA has enabled the disintegrated generations to recognize or identify with one another. It enables public recognition of existing tribes, tribal genealogies, tribal tales, tribal epics, the tribal iii shrines, and the tribal land. Reconciliation has been carried out at both intertribal and intra-tribal levels. The FTA enables identification of people who are residing on land and utilizing resources they do not have a right to. It makes people aware of their roots or the land of their origin, which would then lead to reduced land disputes that constrained development initiatives and the well-being of the people. The results, however, indicated that the FTA has problems either in the approach itself or in its management. It is incapable of achieving its objectives (reducing land disputes, enable rural development, enable tribal land registration, and resettling land that was wrongly acquired). People have split perception of the FTA and the legislation; this therefore reduces potential motivation that is needed to advance the approach. Results of the research also indicated that no proper and serious documentation has been done, despite knowing that it is one of the pillars. In To'abaita, gender and culture are contributing issues, which cause difficulties to the FTA. Also, the FTA lacked financial support. Those that have experience with the FTA believe that the FTA objectives need to be made known to promote motivation to the illiterate people of To'abaita. Adequate communication of issues to improve the FTA is essential. Forming a committee that oversees the design and management of the FTA is necessary for its improvement, and adequate financial support will bring the FTA forward. Chief empowerment by the legislation is essential to enable the FTA to achieve its objectives in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land disputes</field><field name="subject">land policies</field><field name="subject">Family Tree Approach</field><field name="subject">indigenous knowledge</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">recognition</field><field name="subject">reconciliation</field><field name="subject">recording</field><field name="subject">registration</field><field name="subject">well-being</field><field name="subject">priesthood lines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370108 Rural Sociology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Experience of Dialectical Behaviour Therapists: Challenging Therapeutic Pessimism Related to Borderline Personality Disorder</field><field name="creator">Rossiter, Rachel Cathrine</field><field name="description">Doctor of Health Science</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">borderline personality disorder, dialectical behaviour therapy, clinical, health sciences, mental health, health personnel attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching singing in Sydney government schools</field><field name="creator">Hughes, D.</field><field name="description">In New South Wales education, music is a mandated primary school subject incorporated in the key learning area of Creative Arts. In secondary education, music is typically a mandatory Stage 4 subject and an elective subject choice in Stages 5 and 6. School music syllabuses include singing as a performance experience. The methodology and appropriateness of teaching children and adolescents to sing are issues expressed in the literature. Research and scientific based understanding of the voice clearly indicate that care should be taken when teaching singing to developing voices. These reasons, together with the presumption that all students will sing at some stage during their schooling, invoke the primary research questions of &#8220;who teaches school singing?&#8221;, &#8220;what types of school singing are taught?&#8221;, &#8220;how is school singing taught?&#8221; and &#8220;why is school singing taught?&#8221;. Through an investigation and analysis of teacher perspectives, this study addresses these questions in relation to teaching singing in Sydney government schools. The research is comprised of two parts. Part 1 was a broad-based questionnaire approach that generated qualitative and quantitative data. By encompassing primary and secondary classroom and/or choir teachers (127 respondents), school singing within a continuum of learning was investigated. Part 2 extended the format and focus of Part 1 by undertaking qualitative in-depth interviews of teachers (10 participants) sampled to investigate a range of key issues and school singing cultures. The study found that school singing at primary level was predominantly taught by generalist classroom teachers. A range of primary specialist teachers - dedicated music and/or choir specialist teachers, designated music and/or singing specialist teachers and dedicated performing arts specialist teachers &#8211; was identified as also teaching school singing activities. Secondary classroom music teachers were those found to teach, either solely or in conjunction with singing tutors, secondary school singing. The study determined that school singing was an activity occurring in conjunction with music syllabuses (syllabus singing), in relation to other syllabuses (co-syllabus singing) and irrespective of syllabus connections (non-syllabus singing). In addition, ancillary syllabus singing linked singing activities occurring outside the music classroom to syllabus singing within the music classroom. Co-syllabus singing was identified as being either thematic (illustrating a topic area) or supplementary (reinforcing learning in a non-musical area). In addition to defining the types of school singing in relation to both primary and secondary syllabuses, there was evidence of a dichotomy in school singing between teaching singing (formal singing) and the teaching of, or inclusion of, singing activities (informal singing). Determining whether students were taught a song or taught how to sing (it) in Sydney government schools, formed one of the major areas of impetus and focus for the study. After identifying 19 components present in respondent data at elemental or proficient levels, comparison and inclusion rates of teaching components were used to determine five levels of respondent teaching approaches - sing-along, song, song dominant, functional and developmental. Descriptive statistics and univariate statistical analysis of components revealed that component inclusion increased as the level of teaching approach increased. Independent-sample t-tests showed that there were significant differences between approaches to teaching school singing and the types of teachers who teach school singing (for example between specialist/non-specialist teachers). Contributory factors of school singing were identified as support for school singing, objectives of school singing, aptitude for school singing and constraints that restricted school singing. The types of school singing found their origins in the purposes of the singing activities. In some cases, the school culture also determined the types and purposes of school singing. Where school singing was established within the school culture, singing activities were reported as being well supported and the school culture was such that it encouraged or even enabled singing activities to occur. Conclusions drawn from the research findings have implications for the pre-service and in-service training of teachers, for those responsible for school singing activities and for those writing curriculum, curriculum related documents and teaching resources.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">singing</field><field name="subject">school music</field><field name="subject">instruction and study</field><field name="subject">music in education</field><field name="subject">voice culture</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Sydney (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/36654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early vs. late Serbian-English bilinguals' responses to two Australian English vowel contrasts</field><field name="creator">Krebs-Lazendic, Lidija</field><field name="description">Adults learning a second language (L2) (&#8220;late learners&#8221;) have difficulty achieving a native speaker&#8217;s level of accuracy in both perception and production of L2 phonetic segments. This difficulty often results in deviant production of L2 segments that is perceived as accented speech by native speakers of that language. It is generally agreed that this failure in non native segmental production and perception is caused by previous linguistic experience with the first (L1) language. Late learners are expected to show stronger L1 effects than learners who learnt their L2 in early childhood (&#8220;early learners&#8221;). However, not all L2 phonetic segments are equally difficult for late learners. The learnability of L2 phonetic segments is thought to be perceptual in nature and depends on the perceived phonetic distance between them and the acoustically, phonetically and/or articulatorily most similar segment(s) in the learner&#8217;s L1 phonetic inventory. It is generally assumed that specific L2 segments will be perceptually related or assimilated to the most similar L1 segment(s) even if there is a detectable acoustic difference between them. The studies reported in this thesis examined Serbian-English bilinguals&#8217; perception and production difficulties with two Australian English vowel contrasts that are not contrastive in Serbian: /e/ - /&#230;/ and /i:/ - /&#61513;/. We compared participants who began learning English before 5 years (&#8220;early&#8221;) versus those who began after 15 years (&#8220;late&#8221;). In Study 1and Study 2 early learners discriminated and produced both contrasts equally well, whereas late learners had greater difficulties perceiving and producing /e/ - /&#230;/. In Study 3 a priming paradigm was applied to discrimination and perceptual assimilation tasks in which the prime and target contain phonologically identical, phonetically similar or phonologically and phonetically unrelated vowels under two interstimulus intervals (ISI) that tap phonological versus phonetic levels of processing, according to prior research. Early versus late group differences suggest that discrimination and production accuracy reflect how listeners assimilate Australian English vowels to native Serbian vowels. &#8220;Early&#8221; and &#8220;late&#8221; learners related L2 vowels to L1 differently, which reflects differences in establishment of the L1 phonetic system at the time of L2 onset.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Serbian language</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">vowels</field><field name="subject">study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Serbian speakers</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">phonetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/36713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallising meaning: attitudes of listening to illness narratives</field><field name="creator">Foster, Sandra Joan</field><field name="description">This study involves listening to illness narratives embedded in in-depth life review processes.

In the absence of specific literature on the subject, the study made a significant and original contribution to knowledge about social work staff turnover, including the meaning attached to work, the relationship of social workers to the hospital organisation, and to job satisfaction. Using qualitative methodology, data were collected from multiple sources including in-depth interviews at two large Sydney Teaching Hospitals, a period of engagement in each Social Work Department, a comprehensive review of primary data from archival records of the Directors of Social Work Services in Teaching Hospitals (NSW) between 1981-1999, and secondary source materials of federal and state health policy documents. Two core categories emerged from the study which were social workers 'tolerance' of the hospital environment and their qualities of 'selfactualisation'. Of central importance to the inquiry was the discovery of grounded theory which explained the relationship of these categories to the phenomenon of 'staying'. The intersection of 'tolerance' and 'self- actualisation' qualified 'staying' as either a positive or negative experience for the social worker and the hospital. This theory was presented as an original model which with further refinement, could be used as a predictive tool in studies of turnover of social workers in hospital settings. The findings challenged existing theories that staff retention was preferable to staff turnover in hospital organisations and identified qualities in hospital social workers which would ensure the continuing relevance of social work to the changing hospital environment. The model has implications for hospitals, Social Work Departments and for social work education in the preparation and training of social workers to join the hospital workforce. Specific activities that supported the 'self-actualisation' of social workers, and aspects of 'tolerance' were identified which worked for the benefit of both social workers and hospitals.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hospital social work</field><field name="subject">turnover</field><field name="subject">recruitment &amp; retention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facade colour and aesthetic response: Examining patterns of response within the context of urban design and planning policy in Sydney</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Zena</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colour, aesthetics, urban design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumers' choice factors of an upscale ethnic restaurant</field><field name="creator">Sriwongrat, Chirawan</field><field name="description">Globally, there is a growing demand for food away from home as a result of higher incomes, changes in consumption patterns, changes in household composition, and the time pressures created by dual-working families. The foodservice industry has become highly competitive as the number of foodservice outlets has increased to meet the demand. In order to succeed in such a competitive industry, restaurant operators need to understand the factors (and their relative importance) that influence restaurant patrons&#8217; decision when selecting a restaurant. The demand for ethnic foods has also increased, in New Zealand and worldwide, due to the influences of ethnic diversity, overseas food and cultural experiences, and media exposure. Despite the importance of restaurant choice criteria and a growth in popularity of ethnic foods, published research on consumers&#8217; restaurant selection behaviour that focuses on the ethnic segment is relatively limited. Furthermore, there are no published empirical studies on ethnic restaurant choice behaviour in New Zealand. This research aims to fill these gaps in the literature by empirically identifying the factors that influence a decision to dine at an upscale ethnic restaurant, their relative importance, as well as their relationships with dining occasion and consumer characteristics. Focus group discussions and the literature review helped identify a set of restaurant choice factors. A mail survey was used to collect the data. Factor analysis was used to refine the restaurant choice factors, and logistic regression analysis identified the five significant factors that influence consumers&#8217; decision. These are: Dining Experience, Social Status, Service Quality, Food Quality, and Value for Money, listed in order of their importance. The results of t-tests and ANOVA suggested that consumers perceived the restaurant choice factors differently based on their demographic characteristics. The results of this study contribute to the marketing theory by providing an empirical framework of consumer selection behaviour in New Zealand upscale ethnic dining establishments. The study will also assist marketing practitioners and operators of ethnic restaurants to develop their strategies and offer the attributes that attract and retain customers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">upscale ethnic restaurant</field><field name="subject">ethnic foods</field><field name="subject">foodservice industry</field><field name="subject">restaurant choice factor</field><field name="subject">consumer selection behaviour</field><field name="subject">logistic regression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiplicity of perceptions on the sequelae of childhood sexual abuse : development of an empirical framework : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pechtel, Pia</field><field name="description">After over 30 years of research, our knowledge of the consequences of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is still marked by considerable disarray. A research programme of three studies was designed to improve our understanding of functioning in adulthood after CSA by considering perceptions of sexual abuse from three different viewpoints: Clients with a history of CSA, lay, non-abused adults, and sexual abuse practitioners. In the first study, Multidimensional scaling was employed to develop a reporting device summarising the wide range effects and coping efforts likely to following sexual abuse (RESA &#8211; Reporting Effects of Sexual Abuse). A two-fold mapping and profiling approach was then used to highlight consistency and specificity of sexual abuse sequelae by comparing effect-coping patterns of 113 adults with a history of CSA to profiles describing the functioning of nontraumatised adults. The second study then enquired about the stability of perceptions of CSA consequences carried by 149 lay, non-abused adults. An analogue priming study explored how the impact of emotional arousal and cognitive re-structuring intervention adjust participants&#8217; understanding of CSA outcomes. As lay, non-abused adults were found to carry an oversimplified perception of CSA sequelae, Study Three therefore investigated if practitioners were exempt from such underlying biases. Signal detection analysis was used in the final third study to independently assess 85 practitioners&#8217; judgment accuracy and bias when asked to identify sexual abuse effects among a set of supposedly unrelated behaviour, and to discriminate direct effects from secondary ways of coping with CSA. While practitioners were successful in detecting relevant CSA sequelae, they nonetheless demonstrated a highly overinclusive perception compared to the empirical reports by sexually abused clients and societal perceptions. Findings of the three studies were integrated to build an empirical framework on the multiplicity of perceptions on the sequelae of CSA. Overall, this research showed that all individuals, regardless of their association with CSA, carry perceptions about the consequences of CSA. These perceptions appeared to be universal, independent of emotional arousal or attempted cognitive restructuring. While CSA clients reported an array of effects and coping efforts, society only seemed to reflect basic elements of these as related to CSA. Professionals, on the other hand, indicated overinclusive perceptions in which most characteristics were identified as CSA sequelae, in particular as a mean of coping. Finally, no specific pathway was found to follow CSA. While there appeared to be an increased intensity of effects and a greater need for coping among adults with a history of CSA, the general pattern or type of sequelae was also reported by non-traumatised adults. Understanding the functional processes underlying these patterns of common sequelae can help to tailor treatment to the individual needs of clients who experienced CSA. Further implications of this empirical model for practice and research in the area of sexual abuse in Aotearoa/New Zealand are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child sexual abuse</field><field name="subject">adult child sexual abuse victims</field><field name="subject">sexual abuse sequelae</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance measurement of healthcare facility management: A way forward</field><field name="creator">Hamwi, Tayfe, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Facilities management is emerging rapidly as a distinct and critical field of study and professional practice for all sectors of the economy. In the past it has tended to be regarded as a service function and subsumed within other areas such as engineering, the built environment and business management. The health sector is an important part of the overall FM industry because it represents a driver of capital works that is both extensive and expensive. The health sector building requirements are growing, demand regular maintenance and upgrading, and are critical to core business.  An extensive literature review revealed that there has been minimal published research into the development and implementation of a central feature of effective FM, namely, performance management. Performance management provides the primary evaluation and planning tool for FM, in that it identifies the performance indicators that are meaningful to FM and core business, provides measures for those indicators and enables projective planning and benchmarking to be undertaken. This research study assesses the possibility of developing a comprehensive performance measurement system for FM in the healthcare sector. The research has two main aims: - To identify the knowledge gaps in current FM performance measurement systems in general, and for the healthcare sector in particular. - To investigate the possibility of benchmarking FM performance across the healthcare sector using a weighted assessment across all categories of performance. In order to meet the research purpose and data collection requirements from the relatively limited number of FM experts who specialise in the health sector, the research methodology employs a combination of a case study approach as an exploratory tool, and a phenomenological approach as the main qualitative design.  In achieving the aims and objectives, this research helps in improving FM practice in the healthcare sector through: - Providing facility managers with a comprehensive study which highlights the achievements and knowledge gaps in FM and its performance measurement - Providing top management with a study for the effectiveness of developing decision support strategy to make effective and efficient changes to their facility management practices - Facilitate the implementation of benchmarking techniques in the health sector, in order to improve the performance of the healthcare sector FM over time.  The study concludes that developing aggregate/collective KPIs for each performance measurement category of possible measure (social/quality, financial, environmental, functional, and technical) is feasible. However, before being able to develop and implement that approach an improvement to the current FM practices is required. The improvement can be achieved via either a voluntarily or compulsory commitment from top management towards FM in the organizations. This commitment should be implemented with an appropriate hierarchy from the bottom to the top. The key components include: establishing the contribution of FM to the success of the overall business in financial terms; setting agreed FM objectives; deriving meaningful general KPIs; defining the data required for each KPI; establishing the system for collecting, analyzing and interpreting the data; and conducting the benchmarking process for continual improvement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healthcare</field><field name="subject">Facility management</field><field name="subject">Key performance indicator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of chemical additives on the interfacial phenomena of high alumina refractories with al-alloys</field><field name="creator">Koshy, Pramod, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Understanding high temperature interfacial phenomena with Al-alloys is essential for improving corrosion performance of refractories in melting/holding furnaces. Both physical and chemical properties are known to influence wetting and corrosion behaviour. However, uncertainties exist regarding the influence of SiO2 in refractory compositions on interfacial reactions/mechanisms, particularly when present along with non-wetting chemical additives like BaSO4, CaF2 and AlF3.  An experimental study was conducted to clarify the interfacial phenomena of Al-alloy7075 with high-alumina refractories at extreme furnace temperatures of 1250??C and 815??C, using classical sessile drop approach and industrial cup tests respectively.  At 1250??C, Al-alloy reacted more intensely with SiO2 compared to Al2O3. The interfacial behaviour of SiO2-Al2O3 system with Al-alloy was strongly dependent on SiO2 percentage, such that when upto 25% silica was present, wetting was reduced due to the presence of both original and newly formed corundum. Formation of mullite and originally present silica, along with decreasing corundum contents increased wetting in systems where silica varied from 25-45wt% and more than 45wt% respectively. Moreover, the nature of silica did not influence wetting when present in concentrations less than 20wt%. Different additives produced varying interfacial reactions in the Al-alloy/high-alumina refractory system. AlF3 did not improve the wetting resistance, except when present in high concentrations (&gt;10wt%) in the refractory; this improvement attributed to corundum-rich matrix formation resulting from silica loss as gaseous fluorides. Low CaF2 amounts (&lt;3wt%) improved the wetting resistance due to corundum presence and anorthite formation in the refractory. As CaF2 content exceeded 5wt%, proportion of glassy phases increased, hence enhancing interfacial reactions. However unlike CaF2, low BaSO4 levels (&lt;5wt%) decreased the wetting resistance due to barium silicate formation, while high BaSO4 concentrations (&#8805;10wt%) increased the wetting  resistance due to celsian formation. Also, CaF2 dominated interfacial mechanisms when present along with BaSO4 in the refractory.  The effect of additives on modifying wetting resistance was found to strongly vary with SiO2 levels of the refractory. The study demonstrated that additive effect is also influenced by treatment temperatures such that generally higher additive amounts are required at lower temperatures for improving the wetting resistance of high-alumina refractories.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-wetting additives</field><field name="subject">Refractory</field><field name="subject">Aluminium</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">University Library Web Site Design: A Case Study of
the Relationship between Usability and
Information Literacy Development</field><field name="creator">Sawetrattanasatian, Oranuch</field><field name="description">A university library web site is created as a means for providing information resources and services without the limitation of time or space. To ensure that the design of the web site will not be an obstacle to their users, usability is a key issue raised among librarians. In the tertiary context, information literacy is also widely promoted since it is regarded as the skills that can empower human development in the Information Society. These two issues, web site usability and information literacy, have motivated this thesis which is a case study influenced by phenomenography. The research was conducted with the purpose of investigating the relationship between the design of a university library web site, in particular its usability, and the development of students' information literacy through their experience of using the web site.
The understanding found within this research is informed by three clear phases of data collection: Phase 1: Development of the Criteria, Phase 2: Assessment of a Usable University Library Web Site Fostering Information Literacy, and Phase 3: Investigation of Students' Conceptions of Information Literacy Development. Various research methods were used in each phase: questionnaires, focus groups, and experts' selection of the criteria for Phase 1, heuristic evaluation and usability testing for Phase 2, and focus groups, think aloud protocols, and interviews for Phase 3. The data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Two major outcomes are revealed as a result of the research. The first is the usability measures/criteria capable of reinforcing information literacy that can be useful in evaluating the design of a university library web site. The second is a model describing students' conceptions of information literacy development through the use of a university library web site. Results of the research also reveal that there is a relationship between the design of a university library web site, in particular its usability, and the development of students' information literacy through their experience of using the web site. This applies particularly at the information level, especially Information Literacy Attribute #2: finding and accessing the needed information efficiently and effectively. The students experience information literacy development through the use of a university library web site by experiential learning. Their conceptions of information literacy development can be divided into three categories: "no development", "restricted development", and "transferable development". Interestingly, there is no difference between students from different disciplines in terms of their ways of experiencing information literacy development through the use of a university library web site.
Considering the results, the hypothesis that there is no relationship between the design of a university library web site, in particular its usability, and the development of students' information literacy through their experience of using the web site is rejected. In contrast, the hypothesis that there is no noticeable difference between students from different disciplines in their ways of experiencing information literacy development through the use of a university library web site is accepted.
The research makes contributions to both theory and practice. Theoretically, it proposes a model describing students' conceptions of information literacy development through the use of a university library web site as well as the chronology and continuity of their conceptions. Practically, there are implications for university library web site design: implications for usability evaluation methods, for usability measures/criteria capable of supporting information literacy that can be used to evaluate the design of a university library web site, and for the usable and information literacy-supportive design of a university library web site. In addition, it also suggests some implications for information literacy development: implications for investigating the students' conceptions of information literacy development, for information literacy education in regard to the academic environment, and for information literacy education in regard to a university library. The study concludes with recommendations for possible future research in the hope that further insights into the design of a university library web site and information literacy development may be revealed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">website design</field><field name="subject">usability</field><field name="subject">information literacy</field><field name="subject">academic environment</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090311.091629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVOLUTION OF SEX-DETERMINING
MECHANISMS IN REPTILES</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Alexander E.</field><field name="description">Reptiles exhibit marked diversity in sex-determining mechanisms. Many species exhibit
genotypic sex determination (GSD) with male heterogamety (XX females/XY males),
others have GSD with female heterogamety (ZW females/ZZ males), and still others
exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). The distribution of these
mechanisms throughout the reptile phylogeny implies evolutionary lability in sex
determination, and in some lineages there has been a number of transitions between
GSD and TSD. Despite this diversity, GSD and TSD have traditionally been viewed as
mutually-exclusive mechanisms of sex determination in reptiles, since there is little
evidence for their co-occurrence. Considerable empirical and theoretical effort has been
directed towards understanding the adaptive significance of TSD in reptiles. In
comparison, there has been little focus on understanding how evolutionary transitions
between GSD and TSD occur at a genetic and mechanistic level. I addressed this
question by applying both empirical and theoretical approaches to investigate
interaction of genotypic and temperature influences in the sex determination of two
endemic species of Australian lizards.
The three-lined skink, Bassiana duperreyi, has XX/XY chromosomal sex
determination, yet a previous investigation reported a significant male bias in the sex
ratio of eggs incubated at low temperatures. To enable an explicit test for temperature induced
sex reversal in this species, a 185 bp Y chromosome marker was isolated by
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. The marker was
subsequently converted into a duplex PCR assay that co-amplified a 185 bp (or 92 bp)
Y chromosome fragment and a 356 bp fragment of the single-copy nuclear gene C-mos
(from both sexes) as a positive control. The accuracy of the PCR sex assay was tested
on 78 individuals for which sex reversal was not expected. PCR genotype and sex
phenotype were concordant for 96% of the animals. This is one of the very few sex tests
developed for a reptile, and the first report of Y chromosome sequence from a reptile.
The PCR assay was subsequently applied to genotype hatchlings from both cool
(16-7.5C) and warm (22-7.5C) cyclical incubation temperature treatments, and
identified sex reversal in 15% of genotypically female (XX) embryos (n=26) from the
cool treatment, but no sex reversal in eggs from the warmer treatment (n=35). Thus, low
incubation temperatures can over-ride genotypic sex determination in B. duperreyi,
indicating that GSD and TSD co-occur in this species.
The Central bearded dragon, Pogona vitticeps (Agamidae), has ZZ/ZW chromosomal
sex determination, and is a member of a lizard family in which GSD and TSD are both
widespread, indicating evolutionary lability in sex determination. AFLP analysis was
applied to isolate homologous Z and W chromosome-linked markers (71 bp and 72 bp,
respectively) from this species. The AFLP sequences were subsequently extended into
larger genomic fragments by a reiterated genome walking procedure, producing three
non-overlapping contigs of 1.7 kb, 2.2 kb and 4.5 kb. The latter two fragments were
verified as distinct, homologous Z/W chromosome fragments by PCR analyses. An
amplified 3 kb fragment of the 4.5 kb contig was physically mapped to metaphase
spreads, identifying the W microchromosome, and for the first time in this species, the
Z microchromosome. PCR analyses indicated the presence of homologous sequences in
other Australian agamid species, including both GSD and TSD species. The isolated
sequences should therefore prove useful as a comparative genomic tool for investigating
the genomic changes that have occurred in evolutionary transitions between sexdetermining
mechanisms in agamids, by enabling the identification of chromosomes in
TSD species that are homologous to the sex chromosomes of P. vitticeps. The isolated
sequences were further converted into a duplex DNA sex assay that co-amplified a 224
bp W chromosome fragment and a 963 bp positive control fragment in both sexes. This
PCR assay diagnosed chromosomal sex in three Pogona species, but was not effective
outside the genus.
Incubation treatment of P. vitticeps eggs revealed a strong and increasing female bias at
high constant temperatures (34-36C), but an unbiased sex ratio between 22-32C.
Hatchlings from three clutches split between 28C and 34 or 36C incubation treatments
were genotyped with the W chromosome AFLP marker. At 28C, the sex ratio was 1:1
but the high temperature treatments produced 2 males and 33 females. All but one of the
30 lizards (97%) incubated at 28C had concordant sex phenotype and genotype, but
only 18 of 35 animals (51%) from the high temperature treatment were concordant. All
discordant animals were genotypic males (ZZ) that developed as females. Thus,
temperature and genotypic influences can interact to determine sex in P. vitticeps.
These empirical findings for B. duperreyi and P. vitticeps were extended into a novel
theory for the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles, working within the
framework that species with temperature-induced reversal of chromosomal sex
determination are a window to transitional stages of evolution between GSD and TSD.
A model was derived from the observation that in both lizards, an extreme of incubation
temperature causes sex reversal of the homogametic genotype. In this model, the
strength of a genetic regulatory signal for sex determination must exceed a threshold for
development of the homogametic sex to occur (male in Pogona, female in Bassiana).
The strength of this signal is also temperature-sensitive, so diminishes at extremes of
temperature. Simulation modelling demonstrated that increasing the relative magnitude
of the threshold for sexual development can cause evolutionary transitions between
GSD and TSD. Even more remarkably, decreasing the relative magnitude of the
threshold value causes an evolutionary transition between female and male
heterogametic GSD. Quantitative adjustment of a single model parameter (the threshold
value) thus charts a continuous evolutionary pathway between the three principal
mechanisms of sex determination in reptiles (XX/XY-ZZ/ZW-TSD), which were
previously considered to be qualitatively distinct mechanisms.
The experimental demonstration of temperature-induced reversal of chromosomal sex
determination in both B. duperreyi and P. vitticeps presents a challenge to the traditional
view that reptilian sex determination is strictly dichotomous (GSD or TSD), and
suggests instead that sex determination in reptiles consists of a continuum of systems of
interaction between genotypic and temperature influences. Simulation modelling
provided solid theoretical support for this proposition, demonstrating that transitions
along this continuum are effected simply through shifts in the mean population value for
the sex-determining threshold, without requiring substantial genotypic innovation. An
important implication of this theory is that transitions between XX/XY and ZZ/ZW
modes of GSD may retain the same sex chromosome pair, and the same primary sexdetermining
gene, in contrast to previous models for heterogametic transitions. A more
immediate implication of these findings is that many reptile species believed to have
strict TSD (in particular, lizards and crocodilians), may in fact have a sex-determining
system of GSD-TSD interaction, where there is an equilibrium between GSD and TSD
individuals within the population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">reptile</field><field name="subject">sex determination</field><field name="subject">sex-determining mechanisms</field><field name="subject">temperature-dependent</field><field name="subject">genotypic</field><field name="subject">reptiles</field><field name="subject">lizard</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090311.120346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of breaks in optimal storage conditions on "Cripps Pink" apple physiology and quality : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">East, Andrew Richard</field><field name="description">Apples stored onshore in Australia and New Zealand, are maintained at optimal storage conditions with the aid of low temperatures; controlled atmospheres (CA) and new technologies that retard the production or effect of ethylene (AVG and 1-MCP respectively). These technologies allow distribution of the highest quality apples to local and export markets on a year round basis. However, during distribution, maintenance of optimal storage conditions may be lost due to refrigeration system breakdown, operational constraints or management decisions. This thesis quantifies the influence of commercially realistic breaks in optimal storage conditions (temperature and CA) on fruit physiology and quality, both at the time of the break and in subsequent optimal storage conditions. The &#8216;Cripps Pink&#8217; (&#8216;Pink Lady&#8482;&#8217;) apple cultivar was chosen for consideration in this thesis because it is a high value cultivar that is of considerable importance to the Australian apple industry. The knowledge of the behaviour of &#8216;Cripps Pink&#8217; apples in coolstorage conditions (in air and CA) was confirmed through comparison of physiological and quality change behaviour of fruit from three harvests collected in this research and those reported recently by other authors. The investigation of the influence of breaks in temperature control during storage in air at 0&#176;C, revealed that preclimacteric apples exposed to a break in temperature control, were advanced towards the establishment of the climacteric. Postclimacteric apple, responded by doubling ethylene production a short time after return to coolstorage. Harvest maturity, timing of break during coolstorage, length of break of temperature control and multiple breaks in temperature control, had little influence on the increase ethylene production response. Quality factors (firmness, background hue angle, and titratable acidity) were all reduced as a result of exposure to warmer temperatures, but on return to coolstorage temperatures rates of loss in these quality factors were not influenced by the increased ethylene production. Short-term (3-day) breaks in CA while fruit remained at refrigerated temperatures were shown to have no substantial effect on fruit physiology or quality, either during the period of the break in CA or in subsequent CA storage. Breaks in temperature control in combination with breaks in CA were observed to cause a doubling of ethylene production on CA stored apples regardless of being returned to 0&#176;C in air or CA. Those apples that were exposed to a break in temperature control and returned to air storage at refrigerated temperature lost quality (firmness and background hue angle) more rapidly than apples not exposed to breaks in temperature control and transferred to air storage. This result strengthened the knowledge of the influence of ethylene on changes in apple quality, as found for many other apple cultivars. The influence of the decision to transport fruit in CA or air atmosphere shipping containers was initially investigated with a laboratory simulation. Physiology (respiration rate and ethylene production) of air shipped fruit was found not only to be more rapid, but more variable between fruit, than for apples shipped in CA. This more rapid and larger variation of possible fruit physiologies, suggests that in addition to losing quality at a faster rate, the variation in the quality of fruit shipped in air will also enlarge during shipment. This hypothesis was confirmed with data pooled from treatments subjected to 0&#176;C and 3&#176;C, simulating the likely temperature variability within a shipping container. Validation of the influence of shipping atmosphere on delivered fruit quality, was conducted in the commercial environment. This trial found that the length of time to ship fruit from Australia and New Zealand to European markets was not sufficient to induce commercially significant differences between &#8216;Cripps Pink&#8217; apples shipped in the two atmospheres. Finally, as ethylene production was influenced by fluctuations in temperature control and subsequently affected quality of apples previously stored in CA, an investigative attempt to model ethylene production in temperature variable scenarios was conducted. Published models of ethylene production in apples were adapted to the variable temperature storage scenario and a new model was proposed. Unfortunately, none of the models investigated were able to predict all of the consistent behaviours of ethylene production observed during the experimental work, indicating that more knowledge of the ethylene production pathway is required, before modelling of ethylene production and subsequently apple quality can be conducted successfully.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apples</field><field name="subject">post-harvest physiology</field><field name="subject">controlled atmosphere storage</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300304 Post harvest technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defending the high ground : the transformation of the discipline of history into a senior secondary school subject in the late 20th century : a New Zealand curriculum debate : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in Education, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sheehan, William Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the development of the New Zealand secondary school history curriculum in the late 20th century and is a case study of the transformation of an academic discipline into a senior secondary school subject. It is concerned with the nature of state control in the development of the history curriculum at this level as well as the extent to which dominant elites within the history teaching community influenced the process. This thesis provides a historical perspective on recent developments in the history curriculum (2005-2008) and argues New Zealand stands apart from international trends in regards to history education. Internationally, curriculum developers have typically prioritised a narrative of the nation-state but in New Zealand the history teaching community has, by and large, been reluctant to engage with a national past and chosen to prioritise English history. Also in the international arena the history curriculum is shaped by government agencies but in New Zealand in the late 20th century, a minority of historians and teachers had a disproportionate influence over the process. They eschewed attempts to liberalise the subject by the Department of Education (and thereby reflect contemporary developments in the parent discipline) and shaped the curriculum to reflect their own professional interests. This thesis puts forward a hypothesis that seeks to explain the nature of continuity and change in the senior history curriculum in the late 20th century with a view to illuminating the origins of recent debates in the history teaching community. It argues that it is the examination prescriptions that dictate what is taught at this level and that there are three key criteria that must be met if a senior curriculum initiative is to be successfully introduced, or an existing area of historical knowledge is to be retained. Firstly, it is necessary that the decision-making elite share a consensus that a particular body of historical knowledge is of higher status than any alternative. Secondly, a successful initiative must reflect the existing scholarly constraints and boundaries of the parent discipline. Finally, advocates of a particular area of knowledge must be able to establish alliances with major stakeholders in a subject community who are sympathetic to their cause. The role of dominant individuals in this process was paramount in the 1980s as Department of Education curriculum committees at this time operated on the ethos of &#8216;consultation&#8217;, with little explicit philosophical direction and no authentic evaluation. This model is examined by considering the examples of women&#8217;s history (that was successfully embedded in the 1989 curriculum), Maori history (that was not) and 16th and 17th century English history (that has dominated the history curriculum in New Zealand for over 30 years).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">curriculum development</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reconfigured frame: Various forms &amp; functions of the physical frame in contemporary art</field><field name="creator">Geraghty, Ian Craig, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a critical analysis and reconfiguration of the physical frame in contemporary art. Drawing on historical, theoretical and technical knowledge bases,  the thesis characterises the physical frame as the material manifestation of an act (or set of acts) of framing: a constructed ??surplus?? or necessary appendage created to mediate and protect an artwork, connecting it to physical and conceptual contexts in order to facilitate a better understanding of the framed work. The frame is thus depicted as ??work-sensitive??, being formed in response to, and as a direct result of, the work of art. This distinguishes the frame from notions of ??site?? and ??place??, which both connote pre- existing spaces. The physical frame, rather than describing the setting or site to which an artwork is added or contributes to, describes the material build-up which is added to the work.  The thesis documents and examines the various ways that contemporary artists employ physical frames to negotiate physical and conceptual space for artworks. This framing perspective is contrary to the prevalent mindset that contemporary artworks - having broken out beyond the picture frame into real space and time - are now frameless. As a result of this research, the physical frame is reconfigured as an open-ended cellular construct, offering up multiple narrative threads.  A distinction is made in the thesis between an ??immediate?? frame (a frame immediately attached to an artwork which the viewer stands on the ??outside?? of, such as a picture frame) and an ??extended?? frame (an immersive kind of frame experienced by the viewer from ??within?? the frame, as with a ??circumtextual?? frame). In addition to clarifying and developing upon existing framing terminology, this thesis presents a new taxonomic scale of frames in order to test the hypothesis that ??immediate?? frames can be discussed and categorised according to their level of involvement with their associated artworks. This framing model offers a new filter through which to approach the contemporary artwork, and provides a method, vocabulary and set of questions to dissect and articulate the presence and relevance of a detected frame.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frame</field><field name="subject">Contemporary</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A jurisprudence of difference : the denial of full respect in the Australian law of native title</field><field name="creator">Herne, Stephen Charles</field><field name="description">The recognition of native title changed the foundations on which the Australian law of real property rested.

To increase Australia&#146;s capacity to independently diagnose PCVAD in Australia, techniques for the detection of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection in pigs were developed and are reported in this thesis.  These techniques were applied to samples obtained from normal pigs and pigs with disease and confirmed the presence of PCV2 and PCVAD in the Australian pig herd.

Viral DNA was detected in tissues of infected pigs by both standard PCR and real-time PCR techniques.  The real-time PCR was more sensitive.  While the conventional PCR was able to detect approximately 100 copies of the viral genome, the real-time PCR was able to detect 20 copies of the genome.  An immunohistochemical (IHC) technique which was also developed enabled the visualisation of PCV2 antigen in fixed tissues of pigs with PCVAD.

The techniques that were developed were applied to an examination of tissues from pigs affected by illthrift and increased weaner mortality in herds in South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia.  Lesions suggestive of the PCVAD postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) were detected and virus antigen was detected in association with lesions.  The nature of the clinical signs and histopathological lesions detected, coupled with the presence of PCV2 antigen, suggested that PCVAD was present in some Australian pig herds.  Phylogenetic analysis of the strains of PCV2-associated with these disease outbreaks demonstrated they were of a type not previously detected in Australia and similar to strains associated with PMWS in North America. 

To further assist in investigation of PCV2 infections in the Australian pig herd, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed that specifically detected antibody to PCV2 and not the related and non-pathogenic Porcine circovirus type 1. The development of this assay required the production of a virus capsid protein antigen using a prokaryotic protein production system.  The ELISA was used to test serum samples form the Australian national pig serum bank.  A high prevalence of PCV2 infection was detected in most pig herds examined in all Australian states.

International trade in pig meat has resulted in many countries placing restrictions on the importation of pig meat, requiring imported pig meats to be cooked to destroy viral agents.  This study investigated the in vitro resistance of an Australian strain of PCV2 to heat treatment at temperatures between 56&#176;C and 85&#176;C.  The viability of the virus was determined by a combination of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IHC to visualise viral capsid antigen within infected cells.  This study indicated that PCV2 retained its infectivity following heating up to and including 75&#176;C for 15 mins, but was inactivated following heating to 80&#176;C and above.  

The investigations reported make a significant contribution to PCV2 research in Australia and ensure Australia&#146;s capacity to independently investigate PCVAD in the Australian pig herd.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porcine circovirus</field><field name="subject">diagnosis</field><field name="subject">PMWS</field><field name="subject">PCV2</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">ELISA</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20081128.125816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affordances and constraints on informal learning in the workplace: A sociocultural perspective</field><field name="creator">megan.leclus@curtin.edu.au</field><field name="description">In the last few decades, the workplace has been increasingly recognised as a legitimate environment for learning new skills and knowledge, which in turn enables workers to participate more effectively in ever-changing work environments.  Within the workplace there is the potential for continuous learning to occur not only through formal learning initiatives that are associated with training, but also through informal learning opportunities that are embedded within everyday work activities.  Somewhat surprisingly however, there have been relatively limited empirical investigations into the actual processes of informal learning in the workplace.  This may in part be due to the particular methodological challenges of examining forms of learning that are not structured or organised but incidental to daily work activities.  There remains, therefore, a clear need to better understand how learning occurs informally in the workplace, and most importantly, to gain insight into workers&#146; own accounts of informal learning experiences.  This thesis addresses this issue by examining workers&#146; personal experiences of informal learning, and how these contributed to better participation in their regular workplace activities.

Four bodies of literature were reviewed as directly relevant to this research, adult learning, organisational learning, informal learning, and a sociocultural perspective on learning.  Together, they provide complementary perspectives on the development of learning in the workplace.  A conceptual framework, grounded in the sociocultural perspective, was developed to address the issue of how informal learning leads to better participation in the workplace, and reciprocally, how better participation leads to continuous informal learning.  Consistent with the sociocultural perspective, the workplace was conceptualised as a complex social system in which co-workers, who constitute that social system, are assumed to co-regulate each other&#146;s learning opportunities.  Social interactions, therefore, are considered as creating a context in which informal learning is afforded or constrained.  Understanding what role workplace culture and socialisation play in affording or constraining informal learning opportunities is therefore crucial.  This is because the relationships between co-workers is assumed to influence how both new and established co-workers participate in and experience the socialisation process and how they see their respective roles.  The framework developed for the study generated two main research questions: How do co-workers learn informally in the workplace? and How does the workplace, as a social system, afford or constrain informal learning in the workplace?  

The methodology chosen for this empirical study was consistent with key concepts from the sociocultural perspective, namely that individuals and their social context must be studied concurrently as learning is assumed to be part of a social practice where activities are structured by social, cultural and situational factors.  Accordingly, qualitative research methods were employed to gain knowledge and understanding of informal learning in the workplace from the perspective of co-workers.  Co-worker&#146;s reflections on their informal learning experiences and participation in the workplace are presented in narrative form and their accounts interpreted from the sociocultural theoretical perspective.  The narrative format provides a useful way of presenting data in a way that immerses the reader in the phenomenon, with enough concrete details that the reader can identify with the subjective experiences of informal learning of each participant.  

The study highlighted how the nature of some relationships between new and established co-workers afforded opportunities for informal learning, while other relationships constrained such opportunities.  These afforded or constrained opportunities were by nature spontaneous, planned, intentional or unintentional.  The study also revealed that personal and organisational factors co-contributed to creating these social affordances or constraints. Common across groups was the importance given to the quality of relationships between co-workers. The way new and established co-workers participated and interacted in the workplace was found to represent important sociocultural processes that impacted on the effectiveness of informal learning. 

Overall, this study draws attention to the complexity of participation and interaction in the workplace.  A major implication is that opportunities for informal learning are, potentially afforded or constrained by the social context.  The study also highlighted conceptual and methodological issues in identifying and interpreting how co-workers learn informally in the workplace.  Future research should establish how opportunities for effective informal learning might be fostered further through the design of more enabling workplace practices. The significance of perceived and expected roles between new and established co-workers also deserves further empirical attention, at the level of everyday informal practices but also at the level of organisational processes and structures that provide the broader context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">informal learning</field><field name="subject">learning in the workplace</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090201.195209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing Boundaries: Suzuki Bokushi (1770-1842) and the Rural Elite of Tokugawa Japan</field><field name="creator">T.Moriyama@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis centres on a member of the rural elite, Suzuki Bokushi (1770-1842) of Echigo, and his social environment in Tokugawa Japan (1603-1868).  Through a case study of the interaction between one individual&#146;s life and his social conditions, the thesis participates in the ongoing scholarly reassessment of Tokugawa society, which had an apparently rigid political and social structure, yet many features that suggest a prototype of modernity.  Bokushi&#146;s life was multifaceted.  He was a village administrator, landlord, pawnbroker, poet, painter, and great communicator, with a nation-wide correspondence network that crossed various social classes.  His remote location and humble lifestyle notwithstanding, he was eventually able to publish a book about his region, Japan&#146;s &#145;snow country&#146;.  This thesis argues that Bokushi&#146;s life epitomises both the potentiality and the restrictions of his historical moment for a well-placed member of the rural elite.  An examination of Bokushi&#146;s life and texts certainly challenges residual notions of the rigidity of social boundaries between the urban and the rural, between social statuses, and between cultural and intellectual communities.  But Bokushi&#146;s own actions and attitudes also show the force of conservative social values in provincial life.  His activities were also still restrained by the external environment in terms of geographical remoteness, infrastructural limitation, political restrictions, cultural norms and the exigencies of human relationships.  Bokushi&#146;s life shows that in his day, Tokugawa social frameworks were being shaken and reshaped by people&#146;s new attempts to cross conventional boundaries, within, however, a range of freedom that had both external and internal limits.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese history</field><field name="subject">Tokugawa society</field><field name="subject">rural elite</field><field name="subject">Suzuki Bokushi (1770-1842)</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090210.110921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 1961 Kampong Bukit Ho Swee Fire and the Making of Modern Singapore</field><field name="creator">LKSHIS@gmail.com</field><field name="description">By 1970, Singapore&#146;s urban landscape was dominated by high-rise blocks of planned public housing built by the People&#146;s Action Party government, signifying the establishment of a high modernist nation-state. A decade earlier, the margins of the City had been dominated by kampongs, home to semi-autonomous communities of low-income Chinese families which freely built, and rebuilt, unauthorised wooden houses. This change was not merely one of housing but belied a more fundamental realignment of state-society relations in the 1960s. Relocated in Housing and Development Board flats, urban kampong families were progressively integrated into the social fabric of the emergent nation-state. This study examines the pivotal role of an event, the great Kampong Bukit Ho Swee fire of 1961, in bringing about this transformation. The redevelopment of the fire site in the aftermath of the calamity brought to completion the British colonial regime&#146;s &#145;emergency&#146; programmes of resettling urban kampong dwellers in planned accommodation, in particular, of building emergency public housing on the sites of major fires in the 1950s. The PAP&#146;s far greater political resolve, and the timing of and state of emergency occasioned by the scale of the 1961 disaster, enabled the government to rehouse the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims in emergency housing in record time. This in turn provided the HDB with a strategic platform for clearing other kampongs and for transforming their residents into model citizens of the nation-state. The 1961 fire&#146;s symbolic usefulness extended into the 1980s and beyond, in sanctioning the PAP&#146;s new housing redevelopment schemes. The official account of the inferno has also become politically useful for the government of today for disciplining a new generation of Singaporeans against taking the nation&#146;s progress for granted. Against these exalted claims of the fire&#146;s role in the Singapore Story, this study also examines the degree of actual change and continuity in the social and economic lives of the people of Bukit Ho Swee after the inferno. In some crucial ways, the residents continued to occupy a marginal place in society while pondering, too, over the unresolved question of the cause of the fire. These continuities of everyday life reflect the ambivalence with which the citizenry regarded the high modernist state in contemporary Singapore.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Singapore history</field><field name="subject">housing</field><field name="subject">fire</field><field name="subject">Bukit Ho Swee</field><field name="subject">kampong</field><field name="subject">PAP</field><field name="subject">HDB</field><field name="subject">social history</field><field name="subject">oral history</field><field name="subject">high modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090219.104739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide and central autonomic control of blood pressure: A neuroanatomical study of nitric oxide and cGMP expression in the brain and spinal cord</field><field name="creator">K.Powers-Martin@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Essential hypertension is defined as a chronic elevation of blood pressure of unknown cause.  Though a definitive trigger for this change in blood pressure has not been established, there is a strong association with an upregulation of sympathetic output from the central nervous system.  There are a number of central autonomic nuclei involved in the maintenance of blood pressure, including the brainstem regions of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), the sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) within the intermediolateral cell column (IML) of the spinal cord, as well as forebrain regions such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus.  Within these centers, a vast number of neurotransmitters have been identified that contribute to the control of blood pressure, including glutamate, angiotensin II, serotonin, neurotensin, neuropeptide Y, opioids and catecholamines.  Recognition of the role of nitric oxide (NO) and its multiple influences over the neural control of blood pressure is gaining increasing significance.

Nitric oxide is a unique modulatory molecule that acts as a non-conventional neurotransmitter.  As NO is a gas with a short half-life of 4 &#150; 6 seconds, its&#146; synthesising enzyme, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is often used as a marker of location of production.  Once activated, the best-known &#147;receptor&#148; for NO is soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which drives the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).  Identifying the presence of cGMP can therefore be used to determine sites receptive to NO.  Previous studies examining the role of NO in the central autonomic control of blood pressure have focused predominantly upon application of either excitatory or inhibitory drugs into the key central autonomic regions and assessing pressor or depressor effects.  This thesis aims instead to study the neuroanatomical relationship and functional significance of NO and cGMP expression in the brain and spinal cord of a hypertensive and normotensive rat model. 

In the first experimental chapter (Chapter 3), a comparative neuroanatomical analysis of neuronal NOS expression and its relationship with cGMP in the SPN of mature Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHR) and their controls, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) was undertaken.  Fluorescence immunohistochemistry confirmed the expression of nNOS in the majority of SPN located within the IML region of both strains.  However, a strain specific anatomical arrangement of SPN cell clusters was evident and while there was no significant difference between the total number of SPN in each strain, there were significantly fewer nNOS positive SPN in the SHR animals.  All nNOS positive SPN were found to express cGMP, and a novel subpopulation of nNOS negative, cGMP-positive SPN was identified. These cells were located in the medial edge of the IML SPN cell group.  These results suggest that cGMP is a key signalling molecule in SPN, and that a reduced number of nNOS positive SPN in the SHR may be associated with the increase in sympathetic tone seen in essential hypertension.

The second experimental chapter (Chapter 4) aimed to determine if reduced numbers of nNOS containing SPN translated into reduced detectable cGMP.  The functional significance of cGMP signalling in the two strains was then examined. Based on previous work by our group, it was predicted that reduced nNOS in the SHR would translate into reduced cGMP and that intrathecal administration of exogenous cGMP in the spinal cord would drive a differential pressor response in the two animal strains.  Immunohistochemical techniques confirmed that within each SPN, the relative level of cGMP expression was significantly reduced in the SHR when compared to the WKY.  Intrathecal application of 8-bromo-cGMP, a drug analogous to cGMP, increased blood pressure in both strains and had a differential and dose dependent effect, causing only a small increase in blood pressure in anaesthetised WKY animals, while driving a significant pressor response in the SHR.  This finding raised the novel hypothesis that in the SHR, reduced nNOS expression is not a driver of hypertension, but is instead a protective mechanism limiting the potent pressor effects of cGMP within SPN.

The third experimental chapter (Chapter 5) examines the expression of neuronal and inducible isoforms of NOS (nNOS, iNOS) within the RVLM of SHR and WKY rats.  Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyse the level of mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry was then used to further analyse protein levels of nNOS.  Total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed from the RVLM of mature male WKY and SHR.  Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that relative to WKY, mRNA levels for nNOS was significantly higher in RVLM of the SHR.  This was confirmed immunohistochemically.  When compared to iNOS, nNOS was expressed at significantly higher levels overall, however there was no difference in iNOS mRNA expression between the two strains.  This demonstration of differential expression levels of nNOS and iNOS in the RVLM raises the possibilities that (i) NO production is up-regulated in the RVLM in SHR in response to increased sympathetic activity in order to re-establish homeostatic balance or alternatively that (ii) an alteration in the balance between nNOS and iNOS activity may underlie the genesis of augmented sympathetic vasomotor tone during hypertension.

The fourth experimental chapter (Chapter 6) extends the observations in Chapter 5 through examination of the expression of cGMP and sGC within the RVLM.  There is strong functional evidence to suggest that NO signalling in the RVLM relies on cGMP as an intracellular signalling molecule and that this pathway is impaired in hypertension.  Immunohistochemistry was used to assess cGMP expression as a marker of active NO signalling in the C1 region of the RVLM, again comparing SHR and WKY animals.  Fluorescence immunohistochemistry on sections of the RVLM, double labelled for cGMP and either nNOS or phenylethylamine methyl-transferase (PNMT) failed to reveal cGMP positive neurons in the RVLM from aged animals of either strain, despite consistent detection of cGMP immunoreactivity neurons in the nucleus ambiguus from the same or adjacent sections.  This was demonstrated both in the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and in young vs. aged animals.  In-vitro incubation of RVLM slices in the NO donor DETA-NO or NMDA did not reveal any additional cGMP neuronal staining within the RVLM.  In all studies, cGMP was prominent within the vasculature.  Soluble guanylate cyclase immunoreactivity was found throughout the RVLM, although it did not co-localise with the PNMT or nNOS neuronal populations.  Overall, results suggest that within the RVLM, cGMP is not detectable in the resting state and cannot be elicited by phosphodiesterase inhibition, NMDA receptor stimulation or NO donor application. A short time course of cGMP signalling or degradation not inhibited by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor utilised (IBMX) in the RVLM cannot be excluded.

The final experimental chapter (Chapter 7) examines cGMP expression in magnocellular and preautonomic parvocellular neurons of the PVN.  Retrograde tracing techniques and immunohistochemistry were used to visualise cGMP immunoreactivity within functionally, neurochemically and topographically defined PVN neuronal populations in Wistar rats.  Basal cGMP immunoreactivity was readily observed in the PVN, both in neuronal and vascular profiles.  Cyclic GMP immunoreactivity was significantly higher in magnocellular compared to preautonomic neuronal populations.  In preautonomic neurons, the level of cGMP expression was independent on their subnuclei location, innervated target or neurochemical phenotype.  The data presented in this chapter indicates a highly heterogeneous distribution of basal cGMP levels within the PVN, and supports work by others indicating that constitutive NO inhibitory actions on preautonomic PVN neurons are likely mediated indirectly through activation of interneurons.

Summary
Together, these studies comprise a detailed analysis of the neuroanatomical expression of NO and its signalling molecule cGMP in key central autonomic regions involved in the regulation of blood pressure.  Under resting or basal conditions, the studies demonstrate notable differences in the expression of NO synthesising enzymes between normotensive and hypertensive animals, and correlating changes in the downstream signalling molecule cGMP.  In the spinal cord, novel functional differences in cGMP activity were also demonstrated.  In the RVLM, although differences in nNOS were demonstrated, cGMP expression could not be readily detected in either the WKY or SHR, while in contrast within the PVN, cGMP was detected in both magnocellular and parvocellular neuronal populations. 

Conclusion
This thesis gives insight into the physiological role of NO and cGMP as mediators of central blood pressure control.  The results presented indicate that the NO-cGMP dependent signalling pathway may not be the dominant driver responsible for maintaining high blood pressure in the SHR model of essential hypertension, and that there is no globally consistent pattern of expression, and indeed the role of NO as a mediator of pressor and depressor function may vary between the autonomic regions examined.  Further, it is possible that this pathway is only recruited during activation of reflex homeostatic pathways or during times of marked physiological stress, and that the differences we see in basal expression between the normotensive and SHR animals are instead a result of compensatory mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypertension</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">Cyclic GMP</field><field name="subject">Autonomic</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090220.204446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water deficit in bread wheat: Characterisation using genetic and physiological tools</field><field name="creator">J.Zhang@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Under terminal water deficit, the impact of stem carbohydrate remobilization has greater significance because post-anthesis assimilation is limited, and grain growth depends on translocation of carbohydrate reserves. The working hypothesis of this thesis is that increases in stem carbohydrates facilitate tolerance to terminal drought in wheat. The goals of this thesis are to examine this hypothesis using physiological and genetic tools; identify genes that are related to QTL for stem carbohydrate; work with wheat and barley breeders to integrate findings into the breeding program of the Department of Agricultural and Food Western Australia.

The physiological data of three drought experiments (two years in a glasshouse and one year in the field) suggested the maximum level of stem water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) is not consistently related to grain weight, especially, under water deficit. The patterns of WSC accumulation after anthesis differed depending on variety and suggested that WSC degradation and translocation have different genetic determinants. 

Most of the carbohydrates in stem WSC in wheat are fructans. Because 1-FEH gene was an important gene in fructan degradation, the three copies of this gene (1-FEH w1, 1-FEH w2 and 1-FEH w3) were isolated from the respective genomes of bread wheat. In addition, the genes were mapped to chromosome locations and coincided with QTL for grain weight. The results of gene expression studies show that 1-FEH w3 had significantly higher levels in the stem and sheath which negatively corresponded to the level of stem WSC in two wheat varieties in both water-deficit and well-watered treatments. Strikingly, the 1-FEH w3 appeared to be activated by water deficit in Westonia but not in Kauz. The results suggest that stem WSC level is not, on its own, a reliable criterion to identify potential grain yield in wheat exposed to water deficit during grain filling. The expression of 1-FEH w3 may provide a better indicator when linked to instantaneous water use efficiency, osmotic potential and green leaf retention, and this requires validation in field grown plants. In view of the location of the contribution to grain filling of stem WSC, this is a potential candidate gene contributing to grain filling. The numerous differences of intron sequences of 1-FEH genes would provide more opportunities to find markers associated with the QTL. 

A new FEH gene was partially isolated from Chinese Spring and the sequence was closely related to 1-FEH genes. This gene, FEH w4, was mapped to 6AS using Chinese Spring deletion bin lines. The polymorphism of this gene was found between different bread varieties using PCRs and RFLPs, and this allowed the gene to be mapped to two populations of Hanxuan 10 &#215; Lumai 14 and Cranbrook &#215; Halberd. In the population of Hanxuan 10 &#215; Lumai 14, it was close to SSR marker xgwm334 and wmc297 where the QTL of thousand grain weight and grain filling efficiency were located. This result indicated this gene might be another possible candidate gene for grain weight and grain filling in wheat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chromosome mapping</field><field name="subject">fructan 1-exohydrolase (1-FEH)</field><field name="subject">grain yield</field><field name="subject">terminal water deficit</field><field name="subject">water soluble carbohydrate</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090227.120256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological Stress and Vascular Disturbances in Rosacea</field><field name="creator">Daphnesu16@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">Rosacea is a chronic skin disorder, characterized by redness and flushing of the cheeks, nose, chin or forehead. It has been proposed that rosacea is a result of frequent blushing (Miller, 1921; Klaber &amp; Whittkower, 1939). However, the relationship between rosacea and blushing is uncertain. The aim of the present research was to investigate the relationship between psychological stress and vascular disturbances in rosacea. Five studies were conducted. The first study explored the relationship between rosacea and mental health while the next two investigated vascular responses in rosacea sufferers and controls to acetylcholine (which induces endothelial vasodilatation and axon reflexes) and psychological stress (embarrassment). The fourth study aimed to examine the relationship between psychological indicators and rosacea symptoms on a daily basis. The fifth study consisted of three case studies looking at the use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Task Concentration Training (TCT) with rosacea sufferers presenting with social anxiety and fear of blushing symptoms.  

In study 1, sixty-two participants were asked to complete the Blushing Propensity Scale (BPS), Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS). Outcomes from the first study indicated that Type 2 rosacea sufferers (n= 12) perceived themselves as blushing more frequently and intensely than Type 1 rosacea sufferers (n=19) or controls (n=31). This suggested that Type 2 rosacea sufferers experiencing frequent blushing may have a lower sensitivity threshold to blushing episodes. In addition, Type 2 rosacea sufferers perceived themselves as more stressed than Type 1 rosacea sufferers or controls, possibly indicating that managing the condition can be stressful. Contrary to previous reports (Gupta et al., 2006; National Rosacea Society, 2005) severity of rosacea was not associated with depression, social anxiety or fear of negative evaluation. However, a few participants who reported high social anxiety and stress scores were offered psychological intervention (Study 5). 

The aim of the second study was to investigate vascular responses in rosacea sufferers. Cutaneous endothelial and axon reflex function was assessed using an acetylcholine dose response curve. The axon reflex was assessed by inducing a flare with ACh iontophoresis. Outcomes from this study indicated that Type 2 rosacea sufferers had a greater axon reflex response than Type 1 rosacea sufferers. Thus over-reactivity of the axon reflex in Type 2 rosacea sufferers might contribute to prolonged vasodilatation. However, cutaneous endothelial responses to ACh were similar in rosacea and control groups. The results suggested that neural pathways mediated the flushing response rather than cutaneous endothelial function. 

The third study investigated facial blood flow while participants attempted laboratory induced embarrassment tasks. Type 2 rosacea sufferers were found to have a greater blood flow in the facial region than Type 1 rosacea sufferers during singing and speech tasks, suggesting that Type 2 rosacea sufferers blushed more than type 1 rosacea sufferers or controls. Furthermore, Type 2 rosacea sufferers reported higher embarrassment and blushing ratings than Type 1 rosacea sufferers. This indicated that Type 2 rosacea sufferers perceived themselves as emotionally more aroused than other participants. Taken together, it would appear that a combination of physiological and cognitive factors increased facial blood flow in Type 2 rosacea sufferers in laboratory induced embarrassment tasks. 

The fourth study explored the relationship between stress and symptoms of rosacea. Using a diary, 15 rosacea sufferers recorded their stress, anxiety and mood and their intensity of rosacea symptoms daily. Stress was associated with increased stinging/facial redness on the same day for 1 to 2 months.  Furthermore, it was associated with increased stinging ratings the next day. However, feeling anxious or having low mood was not related to increase stinging the next day. The presence of increased stress found in rosacea participants on the day where stinging and redness occurred should be taken into consideration when formulating psychological interventions for rosacea sufferers. 

In study 5, individual psychological intervention was provided to three participants experiencing stress, fear of blushing and social anxiety symptoms. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Task Concentration Training (TCT) were helpful in managing stress, anxiety and fear of blushing symptoms in individual rosacea sufferers. Encouragingly, all participants reported a gain in their repertoire of strategies and showed a decrease in anxiety symptoms on assessment questionnaires following their intervention. Replication of the intervention protocol and investigation of other psychological approaches are required to establish best practise outcome for rosacea sufferers who require psychological interventions. 

The present findings suggest that over-reactivity of axon reflexes contributes to facial flushing. In addition, emotional flushing in rosacea sufferers appears to be maintained by a combination of cognitive and physiological factors. On a clinical level, the study recommends that emotional stress associated with facial flushing in rosacea sufferers to be targeted for psychological intervention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rosacea</field><field name="subject">fear of blushing</field><field name="subject">embarrassment</field><field name="subject">facial flushing</field><field name="subject">vascular disturbances</field><field name="subject">axon reflex response</field><field name="subject">acetylcholine</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090313.115603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of individual characteristics, product attributes and usage situations on consumer behaviour: An exploratory study of the New Zealand, Australian, UK and US wine markets</field><field name="creator">Forbes, Sharon L.</field><field name="description">Previous research has suggested that the country of origin cue is important to consumers during their purchase decision making process; the cue is utilised as an indicator of product quality and thus has an effect on purchase decisions.  However, country of origin research has been heavily criticised in terms of methodology and has tended to focus on durable, manufactured products such as automobiles, electronics and apparel.  This research investigates whether consumers do utilise the country of origin cue during actual wine purchase decisions and whether consumer perceptions of wine will vary based upon the country from which it originates.  In addition, this study also seeks to identify all of the product attributes which are utilised by wine purchasers, and the degree to which these attributes are important to them during the purchase decision process.  Finally, the research seeks to understand the influence that individual consumer characteristics (i.e. demographic variables, product knowledge and product involvement) and usage situations will have upon attribute utilisation and importance.   	In order to examine these broad research questions, a structured survey was developed and administered to respondents in four countries immediately following an actual wine purchase.  Analysis of the collected survey data revealed that consumers typically utilised only a small number of attributes during their purchase decisions, and that the attributes which were most frequently utilised were not necessarily the most important to wine consumers.  The country of origin cue was the eighth most frequently utilised attribute and the fourth in terms of importance.  The majority of consumers could accurately identify the country of origin of the wine they had just purchased and their perceptions of wines were found to vary based upon the country of origin.  Individual consumer characteristics were found to have varying effects upon attribute utilisation and importance ratings.  Three-quarters of all wine purchases were made to resolve just four usage situations, and these situations were found to moderate the origin of the wine that the consumer selected during their purchase decision.  From a theoretical standpoint, this study supports the idea that consumers utilise only a small number of attributes during their decision making process, and that this number will increase as product knowledge and product involvement levels increase.  The most important attributes for consumers were found to be intrinsic in nature.  Country of origin theory has also been advanced by this study; consumers were found to hold stereotyped perceptions of wine based upon its national origin, and both the nationality and education level of the consumer were found to moderate the utilisation of the country of origin cue.  Whilst earlier researchers had suggested that any home country bias may be product specific, this study suggests that it may actually be a product dimension specific phenomenon.  The high reliability of the product involvement and subjective knowledge scales should also be of value to future consumer behaviour researchers.  Similarly, the idea that the usage situation influenced which product was purchased, but not how it was selected, expands current knowledge.  Practical implications arising from this study include the identification of the importance of having previously tried a wine; marketers could increase sales through the provision of wine tasting opportunities for consumers.  The significant correlation between involvement and the frequency of wine consumption also provides wine producers with an opportunity to increase sales through initiatives which will increase consumer involvement with wine.  The results indicate that the wine industry should focus on the production and marketing of wines which are suitable for consumption in the identified four dominant usage situations and should seek to increase consumption in dining situations in the US.  Finally, promotional strategies linking New Zealand wines with high quality appear to have been successful, but these messages will need to be repeated in order to reinforce the positive consumer perceptions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine</field><field name="subject">country of origin</field><field name="subject">product attributes</field><field name="subject">demographics</field><field name="subject">product knowledge</field><field name="subject">product involvement</field><field name="subject">usage situations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-learning adoption in a campus university as a complex adaptive system: mapping lecturer strategies</field><field name="creator">Russell, Carol , Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The adoption of e-learning technologies in campus universities has not realised its potential for meeting the learning needs and expectations of 21st century students. By modelling university learning and teaching as a complex adaptive system, this thesis develops a new way of understanding and managing the adoption of new learning technologies in campus universities. The literature on learning and teaching in higher education indicates that lecturers??? ability to innovate in their teaching is constrained by tacit and discipline-specific educational knowledge. Introducing new methods and technologies into mainstream university teaching requires explicit review of educational knowledge, and requires support from departmental and institutional organizational systems. Research on organizational change in other contexts, such as manufacturing industry, has used complex adaptive systems modelling to understand the systemic interdependence of individual strategies, organizations and technologies. These models suggest that the integration of new e-learning technologies into mainstream campus university teaching will involve corresponding change processes. Part of this change requires the linking up of diverse disciplinary perspectives on learning and teaching. The thesis develops a conceptual framework for researching university learning and teaching as a complex adaptive system that includes learning technologies, people, and their organization within a university. Complex adaptive systems theory suggests that the capacity of a campus university to adapt to new e-learning technologies will be reflected in patterns in the strategies of those lecturers who are early adopters of those technologies. A context-specific study in the University of New South Wales used cognitive mapping to represent and analyse the strategies of a group of 19 early adopters of e-learning technology. These early adopters were participants in a cross-discipline Fellowship programme intended to develop their ability to act as change agents within the university. Analysis of the maps gathered before and after the Fellowship, triangulated with data on the Fellows??? participation in organizational change, leads to a new way of modelling how university learning and teaching systems, including their technologies, adapt within a complex and changing higher education context.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive mapping</field><field name="subject">e-learning adoption</field><field name="subject">complex adaptive systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Group J herbicide resistance in Nasella trichotoma and Sporobolus fertilis and biological control of S.fertilis using the pathogen Nigrospora oryzae</field><field name="creator">Mathisa Thevar Ramasamy Thevar, Sethu Raja Durai</field><field name="description">Serrated tussock (Nassella trichotoma) and Giant Parramatta Grass (Sporobolus fertilis) are among the most noxious weeds in Australia. Both cause problems in pasture and there are limited control measures relying heavily on the herbicide flupropanate. With the recent confirmation of flupropanate resistance in serrated tussock and the report of suspected flupropanate resistance in Giant Parramatta Grass (GPG), this option appeared to be under threat.The aims of this thesis were to determine the extent of flupropanate resistance in serrated tussock and GPG in Australia and to understand the genetics of flupropanate resistance in serrated tussock. This thesis also documents the GPG resistance to 2,2-DPA and investigates a fungal pathogen, Nigrospora oryzae, as a potential biocontrol agent for GPG.      A local paddock survey determined the spread and extent of flupropanate resistance in serrated tussock within 5 km of the original resistant site. The pot-dose method of assessing resistance identified plants resistant to flupropanate up to 3.5 km from the original site found in Victoria. Seeds from these plants showed 0-100% resistance, with sensitive plants often having a low (&#132;T5%) level of resistant seed. These results indicate the movement of flupropanate resistance through seeds or pollen and shows that its spread occurred within one year of detection. A  national mail survey confirmed the massive impacts of serrated tussock across Australia, with annual serrated tussock costs ranging from $15,000 to $16,000 per year per respondent. This survey also identified the widespread infestation of this weed in a variety of land use patterns, from pasture to native grasslands, and the decrease in the value of farmland as a result.      Heritability studies using controlled breeding experiments indicated a strong involvement of a maternal component in the inheritance of flupropanate resistance in serrated tussock, with a minor proportion of resistance heritable through pollen. GPG plants and seedlings were tested for flupropanate and 2,2-DPA resistance.Seedlings tested for flupropanate resistance were highly resistant (tolerating 33-39 times more than sensitive biotypes). With 2,2-DPA, resistant GPG plants did not die even at 14 times the field rate and resistant seedlings also showed 5-6 times more resistance than the sensitive biotype. The study has confirmed that flupropanate and 2,2-DPA resistance now exists in GPG.The potential of Nigrospora oryzae, a pathogenic fungus, as a biocontrol agent for GPG was determined. Mature plants and seedlings of GPG were inoculated with conidia of N. oryzae using three treatments (run-off, crown, and spray). Inoculated plants were smaller, with greater proportions of dead leaves (70% with the run-off a nd crown treatments and 53% with the spray treatment) than the control plants. GPG seedlings inoculated with N. oryzae were stunted and showed greater proportions of necrotic leaves in all the treatments than the control. There is potential to develop N. oryzae as a mycoherbicide to control GPG and further testing is warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPG</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">flupropanate</field><field name="subject">2</field><field name="subject">2-DPA</field><field name="subject">Nigrospora oryzae</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090316.143847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards Exploring Future Landscapes using Augmented Reality</field><field name="creator">Feuerherdt, Craig Nigel</field><field name="description">With increasing pressure to better manage the environment many government and private organisations are studying the relationships between social, economic and environmental factors to determine how they can best be optimised for increased sustainability. The analysis of such relationships are undertaken using computer-based Integrated Catchment Models (ICM). These models are capable of generating multiple scenarios depicting alternative land use alternatives at a variety of temporal and spatial scales, which present (potentially) better Triple-Bottom Line (TBL) outcomes than the prevailing situation. Dissemination of this data is (for the most part) reliant on traditional, static map products however, the ability of such products to display the complexity and temporal aspects is limited and ultimately undervalues both the knowledge incorporated in the models and the capacity of stakeholders to disseminate the complexities through other means.   Geovisualization provides tools and methods for disseminating large volumes of spatial (and associated non-spatial) data. Virtual Environments (VE) have been utilised for various aspects of landscape planning for more than a decade. While such systems are capable of visualizing large volumes of data at ever-increasing levels of realism, they restrict the users ability to accurately perceive the (virtual) space. Augmented Reality (AR) is a visualization technique which allows users freedom to explore a physical space and have that space augmented with additional, spatially referenced information.   A review of existing mobile AR systems forms the basis of this research. A theoretical mobile outdoor AR system using Common-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware and open-source software is developed. The specific requirements for visualizing land use scenarios in a mobile AR system were derived using a usability engineering approach known as Scenario-Based Design (SBD). This determined the elements required in the user interfaces resulting in the development of a low-fidelity, computer-based prototype. The prototype user interfaces were evaluated using participants from two targeted stakeholder groups undertaking hypothetical use scenarios. Feedback from participants was collected using the cognitive walk-through technique and supplemented by evaluator observations of participants physical actions.   Results from this research suggest that the prototype user interfaces did provide the necessary functionality for interacting with land use scenarios.

Tweens are now much more strongly targeted by marketers and businesses than were the previous generation; girls in particularly are targeted more than boys.       Within a fashion context, tween girls are expanding their influence and their consumer power in the market. Following the global acknowledgement of tweens, in Australia, and in Melbourne in particular, tween fashion retailers have been emerging and evolving recently in response to the market's interest and demand for tween fashion. The tween girls' fashion consumption has a viability and is seen a major emergent marketing phenomenon one that is predicted to expand.      There is currently a debate in Australia whether tween girls dress inappropriately as adults. This may be a result of the absence of a particular tween girls fashion sector in fashion industry in Melbourne. Further development will be significant in providing age-appropriate clothing range for the market. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to investigate the market segment.       A case study of a Japanese company is used to gain further understanding of current and future developments within the market. The case study will provide some background information to the situation being presented and assist in the analysis of possible suggestions and recommendations.      The tween girls fashion industry incorporates many different factors. There is a specific focus on the opportunities for expansion and adaptation in the market segment. This research investigates the tween girls' fashion segment in Australia to identify and understand its relationship with respect to fashion marketing and consumption. It also identifies the gaps or opportunities in the market and proposes business opportunities to address these gaps.      This research demonstrates the possibility for the market development of tween girls in Melbourne.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tween</field><field name="subject">Fashion</field><field name="subject">Consumption</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090317.141901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zukunftsmusik: prototyping the social and technological construction of space</field><field name="creator">Trudgeon, Michael</field><field name="description">This project investigates shaping the design practice of a trans-disciplinary creative agency through engagement with research and prototyping. The intention has been to identify and test prototyping processes that permit the generation of novel technological and design solutions that are then recognised as valuable to the project clients. The project research explores a central question in the prototyping of new design solutions. That of who is given access to the prototyping processes and how this affects the efficacy and relevance of the processes and the acceptance of the results. The project research describes three successive modes of engaging complex client bodies in innovative designs encompassing customer service in new spatial configurations. The first mode takes client representations at face value, the second engages the wider client in workshops, and the third involves the wider client in the inclusive design of full-scale prototypes. The findings su ggest that the tangible outcomes of a prototyping process can act as uniquely valuable bridges for introducing and testing new design solutions for clients. These processes help reduce the perceived risk of innovation and promote conversation and dialogue among the diverse and often non-aligned project participants. The project describes ways in which this setting up of the prototyping processes can also contribute significantly to the nature and value of the design outcomes. The prototyping process can begin to act as an idea generator and catalyst. The processes can focus all those involved in contemplating the value of innovation rather than the expressing of concern over the risks involved in addressing change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prototyping</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090317.161641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retirement Income Policy in Australia: Life-Cycle Analyses</field><field name="creator">Kudrna, Jiri</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian retirement income policy</field><field name="subject">Pension reforms</field><field name="subject">Life-cycle optimisation models</field><field name="subject">Labour supply and retirement decisions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nunga rappin: talkin the talk, walkin the walk:
Young Nunga males and Education</field><field name="creator">Rosas Blanch, Faye</field><field name="description">Abstract
This thesis acknowledges the social and cultural importance of education and the role
the institution plays in the construction of knowledge &#150; in this case of young Nunga
males. It also recognizes that education is a contested field. I have disrupted
constructions of knowledge about young Nunga males in mainstream education by
mapping and rapping - or mappin and rappin Aboriginal English - the theories of
race, masculinity, performance, cultural capital, body and desire and space and place
through the use of Nunga time-space pathways. Through disruption I have shown
how the theories of race and masculinity underpin ways in which Blackness and
Indignity are played out within the racialisation of education and how the process of
racialisation informs young Nunga males&#146; experiences of schooling. The cultural
capital that young Nunga males bring to the classroom and schooling environment
must be acknowledged to enable performance of agency in contested time, space and
knowledge paradigms. Agency privileges their understanding and desire for change
and encourages them to apply strategies that contribute to their own journeys home
through time-space pathways that are (at least in part) of their own choosing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nunga males</field><field name="subject">rap and hip hop</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">schooling</field><field name="subject">racialisation</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">time-space pathways</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">relationship</field><field name="subject">blackness</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal English</field><field name="subject">Indigenous stories</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">public and hidden manuscripts</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">critical thinking</field><field name="subject">critical race theory</field><field name="subject">talkin circle</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090226.102604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the spread of invasive species across heterogeneous landscapes</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Joel Peter William</field><field name="description">Invasive species are well known to cause millions of dollars of economic as well as ecological damage around the world. New Zealand, as an island nation, is fortunate because it has the opportunity to regulate and monitor travel and trade to prevent the establishment of new species. Nevertheless foreign species continue to arrive at the borders and continue to cross them, thus requiring some form of management. The control and management of a new incursion of an invasive species would clearly benefit from predictive tools that might indicate where and how quickly the species is likely to spread after it has established. During the process of spread an invasing species must interact with a complex and heterogeneous environment and the suitability of the habitat in a region determines whether it survives. Many dispersal models ignore such interactions and while they may be interesting theoretical models, they are less useful for practical management of invasive species.  The purpose of this study was to create and investigate the behaviour of a spatially explicit model that simulates insect dispersal over realistic landscapes. The spatially explicit model (Modular Dispersal in GIS, MDiG) was designed as am open-source modular framework for dispersal simulation integrated within a GIS. The model modules were designed to model an an approximation of local diffusion, long distance dispersal, growth, and chance population mortality based on the underlying suitability of a region for establishment of a viable population. The spatially explicit model has at its core a dispersal module to simulate long distance dispersal based an underlying probability distribution of dispersal events. This study illustrates how to extract the frequency of long distance dispersal events, as well as their distance, from time stamped occurrence data, to fit a Cauchy probability distribution that comprises the dispersal module.  An investigation of the long distance dispersal modules behaviour showed that, in general, it generated predictions of the rate of spread consistent with those of analytical partial differential and integrodifference equations. However, there were some differences. Spread rate was found to be mainly dependent on the measurement technique used to determine the invasion front or boundary, therefore an alternative method to determine the boundary of a population for fat-tailed dispersal kernels is presented. The method is based on the point of greatest change in population density. While previously it was thought that number of foci rather than foci size was more important in stratified dispersal and that finer resolution simulations would spread more quickly, simulations in this study showed that there is an optimal resolution for higher spread rates and rate of area increase. Additionally, much research has suggested that the observed lag at the beginning of an invasion may be due to lack of suitable habitats or low probability of individuals striking the right combination of conditions in a highly heterogeneous environment. This study shows an alternative explanation may simply be fewer dispersal event sources.  A case study is described that involved the application of the spatially explicit dispersal model to Argentine ant spread to recreate the invasion history of that species in New Zealand. Argentine ant is a global invasive pest which arrived in New Zealand in 1990 and has since spread to both main islands of New Zealand, primarily through human mediated dispersal. The spatially explicit simulation model and its prediction ability were compared to that of a uniform spread model based on equivalent total area covered. While the uniform spread model gave more accurate predictions of observed occurrences early in the invasion process it was less effective as the invasion progressed. The spatially explicit model predicted areas of high probability of establishment (hot spots) consistent with where populations have been found but accuracy varied between 40-70% depending on the year of the simulation and parameter selection. While the uniform spread model sometimes slightly outperformed or was equivalent to the simulation with respect to accuracy early in the invasion process, it did not show the relative risk of establishment and was less effective later in the invasion when stochastic random events generated by the simulation model were averaged to represent trends in the pattern of spread. Additionally, probabilistic predictions as generated by the spatially explicit model allow the uncertainty of prediction to be characterised and communicated.  This thesis demonstrates that heterogeneous spread models can give more insight and detail than one dimensional or homogeneous spread models but that both can be useful at different stages of the invasion process. The importance of compiling appropriate data on dispersal and habitat suitability to aid invasion management has been highlighted. Additionally, a number of important hypotheses that need to be addressed to increase understanding of how species interact with the complex environment, have been identified and discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dispersal</field><field name="subject">spread</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">invasions</field><field name="subject">invasive insects</field><field name="subject">Argentine ant</field><field name="subject">L. humile</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of selective electrophoresis for proteins and peptides within proteomes</field><field name="creator">Ly, Linda, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Analysis of complex protein samples is demanding due to the wide dynamic range of expression levels and the limited detection range of technology. Proteomics relies heavily on the development of new fractionation strategies to help reduce complexity, and overcome the technological and biological challenges associated with proteome analysis. Here, the development of a prototype instrument named ??Microflow MF10?? was explored to enrich for particular classes of proteins.  The MF10 was found to have a number of advantages over commercially available fractionation systems. Due to the reduced separation electrode distance, fractionation was rapid, occuring within ~0.125 kVH over 2-6 fractions under native conditions but longer under denaturing conditions. As low as 2 ng peptide could be fractionated with recovery for downstream analysis achievable. The ability to alter protein charge by changing the pH (acidic (pI 3.6) to basic environments (pI 10.4)) allows selection of proteins based on charge/mobility, size, shape, buffer ionic strength, pH and field strength.  Proteins &lt;10 kDa are also not routinely analysed because current technology is unable to cater for this region of the proteome. Peptide enrichment using the MF10 was achieved using a 7-protein/peptide standard mix (1-25 kDa), to the 1-5 kDa fraction with simultaneous fractionation of the higher mass protein standards. Plasma was also used to enrich for the peptidome (&lt; 5 kDa) in the presence of the proteome. Enrichment of 73 proteins inclusive of 22 proteins in the 1-25 kDa fraction was achieved compared to a total equivalent of 42 proteins from unfractionated plasma.  Rare samples (&#8804; 106 cells) from stem cell populations or derived clinically are challenging due to the absolute limits in protein copy number and abundance. CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells and CD4+/CD8+ T-cells were used to develop fractionation methods and elucidate the cell differentiation process. MF10 fractionation and analysis by SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS revealed 24 differentially expressed proteins between the 3 cell populations, which may be involved in cell differentiation. To quantify these expression differences, iTRAQ with 2-D LC-MS/MS was applied.  This study has highlighted the challenges associated with samples of limited quantity. It has been successful in understanding the effects of various conditions on the electrophoretic mobility of proteins, which in proteomics, has remained largely unexplored.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">Fractionation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Data reliability control in wireless sensor networks for data streaming applications</field><field name="creator">Le, Dinh Tuan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contributes toward the design of a reliable and energy-efficient transport system for Wireless Sensor Networks. Wireless Sensor Networks have emerged as a vital new area in networking research. In many Wireless Sensor Network systems, a common task of sensor nodes is to sense the environment and send the sensed data to a sink node. Thus, the effectiveness of a Wireless Sensor Network depends on how reliably the sensor nodes can deliver their sensed data to the sink. However, the sensor nodes are susceptible to loss for various reasons when there are dynamics in wireless transmission medium, environmental interference, battery depletion, or accidentally damage, etc. Therefore, assuring reliable data delivery between the sensor nodes and the sink in Wireless Sensor Networks is a challenging task. The primary contributions of this thesis include four parts. First, we design, implement, and evaluate a cross-layer communication protocol for reliable data transfer for data streaming applications in Wireless Sensor Networks. We employ reliable algorithms in each layer of the communication stack. At the MAC layer, a CSMA MAC protocol with an explicit hop-by-hop Acknowledgment loss recovery is employed. To ensure the end-to-end reliability, the maximum number of retransmissions are estimated and used at each sensor node. At the transport layer, an end-to-end Negative Acknowledgment with an aggregated positive Acknowledgment mechanism is used. By inspecting the sequence numbers on the packets, the sink can detect which packets were lost. In addition, to increase the robustness of the system, a watchdog process is implemented at both base station and sensor nodes, which enable them to power cycle when an unexpected fault occurs. We present extensive evaluations, including theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments in the &#64257;eld based on Fleck-3 platform and the TinyOS operating system. The designed network system has been working in the &#64257;eld for over a year. The results show that our system is a promising solution to a sustainable irrigation system. Second, we present the design of a policy-based Sensor Reliability Management framework for Wireless Sensor Networks called SRM. SRM is based on hierarchical management architecture and on the policy-based network management paradigm. SRM allows the network administrators to interact with the Wireless Sensor Network via the management policies. SRM also provides a self-control capability to the network. This thesis restricts SRM to reliability management, but the same framework is also applicable for other management services by providing the management policies. Our experimental results show that SRM can offer sufficient reliability to the application users while reducing energy consumption by more than 50% compared to other approaches. Third, we propose an Energy-efficient and Reliable Transport Protocol called ERTP, which is designed for data streaming applications in Wireless Sensor Networks. ERTP is an adaptive transport protocol based on statistical reliability that ensures the number of data packets delivered to the sink exceeds the de&#64257;ned threshold while reducing the energy consumption. Using a statistical reliability metric when designing a reliable transport protocol guarantees the delivery of adequate information to the users,  and reduces energy consumption when compared to the absolute reliability. ERTP uses hop-by-hop Implicit Acknowledgment with a dynamically updated retransmission timeout for packet loss recovery. In multihop wireless networks, the transmitter can overhear a forwarding transmission and interpret it as an Implicit Acknowledgment. By combining the statistical reliability and the hop-by-hop Implicit Acknowledgment loss recovery, ERTP can offer sufficient reliability to the application users with minimal energy expense. Our extensive simulations and experimental evaluations show that ERTP can reduce energy consumption by more than 45% when compared to the state-of- the-art protocol. Consequently, sensor nodes are more energy-efficient and the lifespan of the unattended Wireless Sensor Network is increased. In Wireless Sensor Networks, sensor node failures can create network partitions or coverage loss which can not be solved by providing reliability at higher layers of the protocol stack. In the &#64257;nal part of this thesis, we investigate the problem of maintaining the network connectivity and coverage when the sensor nodes are failed. We consider a hybrid Wireless Sensor Network where a subset of the nodes has the ability to move at a high energy expense. When a node has low remaining energy (dying node) but it is a critical node which constitutes the network such as a cluster head, it will seek a replacement. If a redundant node is located in the transmission range of the dying node and can ful&#64257;ll the network connectivity and coverage requirement, it can be used for substitution. Otherwise, a protocol should be in place to relocate the redundant sensor node for replacement. We propose a distributed protocol for Mobile Sensor Relocation problem called Moser. Moser works in three phases. In the &#64257;rst phase, the dying node determines if network partition occurs, &#64257;nds an available mobile node, and asks for replacement by using &#64258;ooding algorithm. The dying node also decides the movement schedule of the available mobile node based on certain criteria. The second phase of the Moser protocol involves the actual movement of the mobile nodes to approach the location of the dying node. Finally, when the mobile node has reached the transmission of the dying node, it communicates to the dying nodes and moves to a desired location, where the network connectivity and coverage to the neighbors of the dying nodes are preserved.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transport protocol</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor network</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Network management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote synchronization method for the quasi-zenith satellite system</field><field name="creator">Tappero, Fabrizio, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a novel satellite timekeeping system which does not require on-board atomic clocks as used by existing navigation satellite systems such as GPS, GLONASS or the planned GALILEO system.

The salience modulation account of this intermixed-blocked effect proposes that the unique elements of intermixed stimuli are more salient than those of blocked stimuli. The inhibition account proposes that inhibitory links between the unique elements of intermixed stimuli enhance discrimination. The current thesis evaluated the two accounts in their ability to explain this effect in humans. In Experiments 1 and 2, categorisation and same-different judgements were more accurate for intermixed than for blocked stimuli. This indicates that intermixed pre-exposure decreases generalisation and increases discriminability more than does blocked pre-exposure. In Experiments 3 ?? 5, same-different judgements were more accurate when at least one of the two stimuli was intermixed. This enhanced discrimination was not confined to two stimuli that had been directly intermixed. These results are better explained by salience modulation than by inhibition. Experiments 6 ?? 8 employed dot probe tasks, in which a grid stimulus was followed immediately by a probe. Neither intermixed nor blocked stimuli showed facilitated reaction times when the probe appeared in the location of the unique element. In Experiments 9 ?? 11 participants learned to categorise the intermixed unique elements more successfully than the blocked unique elements, but only when the unique elements were presented on a novel background during categorisation. Experiments 6 ?? 11 provide weak evidence that the intermixed unique elements are more salient than their blocked counterparts. In Experiment 12, participants were presented with the shape and location of a given unique element, and were required to select the correct colour. Performance was more accurate for intermixed than for blocked unique elements. In Experiment 13, participants learned to categorise intermixed, blocked and novel unique elements. Performance was better for intermixed than for blocked and novel unique elements, which did not differ. None of the proposed mechanisms for salience modulation anticipate these results. The intermixed-blocked effect in human perceptual learning is better explained by salience modulation than by inhibition. However, the salience modulation accounts that have been proposed received little support. An alternative account of salience modulation is considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">discrimination learning</field><field name="subject">perceptual learning</field><field name="subject">salience</field><field name="subject">visual discrimination</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42882</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of migration on the people of Papua, Indonesia: A historical demographic analysis</field><field name="creator">Upton, Stuart Ingham, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since Papua became part of Indonesia in 1963, hundreds of thousands of people have migrated there from other parts of the nation. By 2000, over a third of the province??s residents were non-indigenous people, with the great majority of these immigrants living in the more developed urban areas along the coast. This mass movement has transformed the territory??s society, altering the social, cultural and economic position and opportunities of the indigenous inhabitants. This thesis uses statistical data from Indonesian government publications to describe the development of these changes to the province??s population from 1963 to the early part of the 21st century. While it is acknowledged that the military presence and actions in the territory have played a crucial role in creating distrust of the Indonesian government among the indigenous people, this material supports the thesis that the mass movement of people to the region has developed an identification among the indigenous peoples of the territory of being part of a single Papuan community, a Papuan nationalism. This migration has also limited the educational and employment opportunities of indigenous people, creating hostility towards the newcomers among indigenous people and resulting in an alienation from the Indonesian nation. It will be argued that the patterns of settlement, employment and perceptions of ethnic difference between indigenous and migrant groups reflect a form of internal colonialism that has resulted from this immigration. While independence is a popular aspiration among indigenous Papuans, an evaluation of the national political situation suggests that this event is unlikely in the foreseeable future. If Papuans are to be incorporated fully into the nation of Indonesia, an understanding of the impact of migration on the province??s people is vital. This material also suggests that while there have been negative consequences of the Indonesian rule of the territory, claims that the indigenous population has suffered from genocide perpetrated by Indonesian forces are not supported by the statistical data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Papua</field><field name="subject">Demography</field><field name="subject">Indigenous people</field><field name="subject">Internal colonialism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanoparticle formation and dynamics in a complex (dusty) plasma: from the plasma ignition to the afterglow.</field><field name="creator">Couedel, Lenaic Gael Herve Fabien</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plasma, capacitive discharge, dust, instabilities, residual charge, diffusion, afterglow, dust growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A journey through the prison garden : weeds in the warehouse</field><field name="creator">Barry, Lillian M.</field><field name="description">Through the implementation of a garden project in two women-centred correctional facilities in New South Wales, this thesis explores tensions between punitive and rehabilitative goals. The impacts of these tensions on the garden project and the every-day lived experience for female inmates form the basis of the research. Initially, the research looked at the rehabilitative potential of a horticultural therapy program for female inmates. This focus correlated with the holistic rehabilitative rhetoric within women&#8217;s prisons in New South Wales. Based on this, a small garden project of five months&#8217; duration was conducted in each of the two correctional facilities over a twelve month period in 2006. Through the implementation and evaluation of this research conflicts between hierarchical, dominating systems of the penal institution and holistic, rehabilitation goals of the garden project were exposed. Utilising qualitative data analysis embedded in critical ethnography, the garden project provided a &#8216;key-hole&#8217; view of these conflicts within the penal environment. The collective data from open- journaling was abstracted from raw data level through to theoretical constructs in combination with a further literature research. Foucault&#8217;s penal justice critique, Weber&#8217;s domination and Goffman&#8217;s totalitarian discourses informed the development of deeper understandings that enlightened on-going explorations in the field. As a result, theoretical understandings identified a tension within the penal environment that appeared to neutralise, fragment and corrode the intended benefits for female inmates of the garden project. This tension was identified as an intangible force, or penal phantom, representing the effects of totalisation within the penal environment. Two streams of inquiry emerged exploring the effects of the total institution on how power is exercised over female inmates and the implications upon the holistic, rehabilitative aims of the garden project. Findings from this research highlight the effects of the penal phantom upon female inmates&#8217; lived experiences, the working realities for prison staff and how these impact upon rehabilitative programs for women in prison. The thesis concludes by examining these effects in the continued marginalisation of the current female inmate population and recommends a review of incarcerative practices that continue to entangle women within criminal justice systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women prisoners</field><field name="subject">female offenders</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">gardening</field><field name="subject">therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">prisons</field><field name="subject">criminal justice, administration of</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/36967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Search for Success in a Charismatic Environment: senior teacher&#8217;s responses to high stakes testing in academically successful Christian Brothers&#8217; schools</field><field name="creator">Davies, Michael</field><field name="description">In Australia, traditionally a wide range of measures have been used to identify academically successful schools. The mix of these measures has varied from state to state. But recently, added to this mix, and perhaps becoming the most influential factor, has been the examination results of senior students. These have become far more available to the prospective parents and governing bodies. They are used to gauge the ranking of the school, and to whether parents can expect their children to gain entry into the more prestigious tertiary programs available. But these scores are also being used to rank staff, and in turn, the &#8216;quality&#8217; of staff becomes yet another factor in identifying an academically successful school. In other words, the notion of high stakes testing is gaining wide spread use across all forms of schooling in Australia, including State, Independent and Catholic schools. This thesis is about teachers in academically successful Christian Brothers&#8217; schools. It is an interpretive study that seeks to understand how these teachers respond to this form of assessment: high stakes testing. Their responses include emotional responses, how they change their teaching style and how they feel about teaching in Christian Brothers&#8217; schools striving for academic success. In this research I interviewed teachers and administrators at three academically successful Christian Brothers&#8217; schools in three different states in Australia. I developed three cases from these interviews and document searches, one drawn from each school, that indicate the range of issues that emerged, for them, as teachers in academically successful Christian Brothers&#8217; schools. The specific use of high stakes testing was found to be very different in each of the schools. One school used high stakes testing as an accountability measure for staff, another used it as an accountability measure for students, and the third had no history of using high stakes testing. The study concludes that academic excellence can be achieved in Christian Brothers&#8217; schools whilst remaining faithful to the ethos that underpins these schools: the Charism of Edmund Rice. Significant factors in the determination of the successful implementation of high stakes testing in these schools were found to be: the effect of senior management; influence of the media; the influence of culture; and changing culture and the nature of the schools. The thesis concludes with a blueprint for a hypothetical Christian Brothers&#8217; school to follow that may lead to academic success.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic secondary school teachers</field><field name="subject">Christian Brothers&#8217; schools</field><field name="subject">High stakes testing</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp193.19032009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting Software Evolution in Agent Systems</field><field name="creator">Dam, Khanh Hoa</field><field name="description">Software maintenance and evolution is arguably a lengthy and expensive phase in the life cycle of a software system. A critical issue at this phase is change propagation: given a set of primary changes that have been made to software, what additional secondary changes are needed to maintain consistency between software artefacts? Although many approaches have been proposed, automated change propagation is still a significant technical challenge in software maintenance and evolution.       Our objective is to provide tool support for assisting designers in propagating changes during the process of maintaining and evolving models. We propose a novel, agent-oriented, approach that works by repairing violations of desired consistency rules in a design model. Such consistency constraints are specified using the Object Constraint Language (OCL) and the Unified Modelling Language (UML) metamodel, which form the key inputs to our change propagation framework. The underlying change propagation mechanism of our framework is based on the well-known Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agent architecture. Our approach represents change options for repairing inconsistencies using event-triggered plans, as is done in BDI agent platforms. This naturally reflects the cascading nature of change propagation, where each change (primary or secondary) can require further changes to be made. We also propose a new method for generating repair plans from OCL consistency constraints. Furthermore, a given inconsistency will  typically have a number of repair plans that could be used to restore consistency, and we propose a mechanism for semi-automatically selecting between alternative repair plans. This mechanism, which is based on a notion of cost, takes into account cascades (where fixing the violation of a constraint breaks another constraint), and synergies between constraints (where fixing the violation of a constraint also fixes another violated constraint). Finally, we report on an evaluation of the approach, covering both effectiveness and efficiency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agent-oriented software engineering</field><field name="subject">software maintenance and evolution</field><field name="subject">inconsistency management</field><field name="subject">change propagation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090319.143847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying Organisation-Public Relationships</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, David Richard</field><field name="description">To date, limited means of accurately measuring the communal organisational public relationships between an organisation and its various publics have been developed.  Researchers and practitioners have acknowledged the need for a more accurate measurement tool.  Previous analysis of communal relationships has typically been done in an anecdotal or non-quantifiable way.  This study explores a new method of quantifying the relationship between an organisation and its publics and identifies the key themes and components that are important to a successful organisation-public relationship (OPR); this method allows organisations to more accurately measure their OPRs, diagnose their strengths and weaknesses and quantify changes in the relationships over time.  In so doing, organisations will be able to improve their relationships with their stakeholders and work more effectively to achieve mutually beneficial goals.      The study's findings contribute to defining the components that can be used to develop a tool that can be used by the public relations profession to more accurately reflect the status of communal relationships, and, perhaps more importantly, the changes in the status of the relationships over time.  Increased objectivity in reflecting the status of the relationships between an organisation and its publics is likely to enable the profession to elevate its perceived status by providing a better service to organisations and their publics.  This, in turn, will allow senior management teams to see clearly the value that public relations can provide to maximise the success of the organisation.      The data obtained from this research provide insights into the priorities and expectations that external stakeholder groups have of organisations and how these expectations can be grouped into three key areas - how they are treated, the value that the relationships represent to them and how effective the communication is.  The results provide practitioners with a valuable insight into ways of improving these OPRs, which in turn could assist organisations in achieving their goals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">organisation-public relationships</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">honesty</field><field name="subject">value</field><field name="subject">measurement of relationship</field><field name="subject">PR measurement</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">relationship management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090319.160313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Boys' Reformatory Brooklyn Park : a history, 1898-1941</field><field name="creator">Keenan, Anthony Michael.</field><field name="description">Typescript (Photocopy) Bibliography: leaves 200-206.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Boys' Reformatory (Brooklyn Park, S.

Further research has shown large performance benefits in sprint and endurance power (7 - 9%) when cyclists combined explosive single-leg jumps with cycling-specific high-intensity interval training during a competitive season. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the jumps to the gains in performance in competitive cyclists in a randomized control trial.The training protocol for the control group was based on previous experimental work in which the control group (n=8) completed cycle specific interval training followed by a series of explosive single-leg jumps. The experimental group (n=7) carried out the same cycle specific interval training but did not participate in the explosive single-leg jumps. While the current study did not use a true control group, the investigation was carried out in the knowledge that a combination of high intensity interval cycling and explosive single-leg jumps causes changes positive changes in performance. Participants took part in 10 x 30-min sessions consisting four sets of high intensity intermittent cycling (4 x 30-s maximum efforts at 50 - 60 min-1 alternating with 30-s recovery). Between each set of 4 x 30 s sprints the control (ballistic) group carried out one set of explosive single-leg jumps (20 for each leg), while the experimental (continuous) group cycled for 20 s at 50 - 60 min-1.Before and after the training period all cyclists completed an incremental peak power test for assessment of VO2max, lactate threshold, exercise economy and peak power, a 30 s Wingate sprint test and a 20 km time-trial. Relative to the control group the percent mean changes (&#177;90% confidence limits) in the experimental group were: power at 4-mM lactate, -4.2 (&#177;6.3); VO2max, -3.1 (&#177;3.7); mean time-trial power, -0.7 (&#177; 4.7); peak incremental power, -1.7; (&#177;5.0); power at 80% max heart rate, -2.8; (&#177;5.6); Wingate peak power, -4.2; (&#177;7.8). We conclude that high-intensity training may improve performance but the combination of high-intensity training and explosive resistance training in the competitive phase is likely to produce greater gains in trained cyclists than high intensity cycling alone.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Competitive cycling</field><field name="subject">Randomized controlled trials</field><field name="subject">Performance gains</field><field name="subject">High intensity interval training</field><field name="subject">Explosive single-leg jumps</field><field name="subject">Training protocols</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/58</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New sport teams and the development of brand community</field><field name="creator">Grant, Nigel</field><field name="description">The professional sport market and its established teams offer consumers a service and experience that is typically high in social identification, emotional involvement (Underwood, Bond &amp; Baer, 2001) and a sense of community or social belonging (Heere &amp; James, in press). The strong social attachment to a sports organisation and its brand is proposed here to closely resemble the concept of a brand community (Mu&#241;iz Jr &amp; O'Guinn, 2001). For newly-established teams without a considerable history, along with having to compete with their established competitors, there is generally a lack of consumer identification or emotional investment in the team.This study aimed to investigate newly-established teams within the New Zealand sports market with two specific research questions: 1) What issues affect the development of a new sports team brand, and 2) Do managers of new sports teams use antecedents of brand community or social identification in their branding strategies, and if so, how?A qualitative, case study approach was used; featuring both interviews with managers of three newly-established New Zealand sports teams and direct observations of their stadiums. Findings suggested that the managers believed that existing image and awareness, audience nature, win-loss record, quality of the team or competition, and a lack of history were the main issues affecting the development of their brands. Respondents largely considered the antecedents of a brand community as important, with the exception of history. Promotion of these antecedents was largely absent from each of the team's branding strategies. Along with providing a detailed review of brand community literature, this thesis provides recommendations for managers of new teams on how to develop and position branding strategy toward the long-term goal of creating a community around their team brand.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Branding</field><field name="subject">Sport marketing</field><field name="subject">Brand community</field><field name="subject">Sports management</field><field name="subject">Consumer identification</field><field name="subject">Case study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">All dolled up and no place to go</field><field name="creator">Trussardi, Gabriella</field><field name="description">This body of work is the result of practice based research, culminating in a collection of five garments featuring pictorial prints, created through digital sublimation printing&#185;.

In the biomedical domain especially, a notable number of ontologies have been developed for knowledge acquisition, maintenance, sharing and reuse from large and distributed databases in order to reach the critical requirements of biomedical analysis and application. This research aims at the development of a Brain Gene Ontology by adopting a constructive IS methodology which tightly combines the processes of ontology learning, building, reuse and evaluation together. Brain Gene Ontology is a part of the BGO project that is being developed by KEDRI (Gottgtroy and Jain, 2005). The objective is to represent knowledge of the genes and proteins that are related to specific brain disorders like epilepsy and schizophrenia. The current stage focuses on the crucial neuronal parameters such as AMPA, GABA, CLC and SCN through their direct or indirect interactions with other genes and proteins. In this case, ontological representations were able to provide the conceptual framework and the knowledge itself to understand more about relationships among those genes and their links to brain disorders. It also provided a semantic repository of systematically ordered molecules concerned. The research adopts Prot&#233;g&#233;-Frames, which is an open source ontology tool suite for BGO development. Some Prot&#233;g&#233; plug-ins were also used to extend the applicable functions and improve knowledge representation. Basically, the research discusses the availability and the framework of the constructive Information System research methodology for ontology development, it also describes the process that bridges different notions of the brain, genes and proteins in various databases, and illustrates how to build and implement the ontology with Prot&#233;g&#233;-Frames and its plug-ins. The results of the BGO development proved that the constructive IS methodology does help to fill in the cognitive gap between domain users and ontology developers, the extensible, component-based architectures of Prot&#233;g&#233;-Frames significantly support the various activities in the ontology development process, and through explicitly specifying the meaning of fundamental concepts and their relations, ontology can actually integrate knowledge from multiple biological knowledge bases.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological data</field><field name="subject">Constructive approach</field><field name="subject">Knowledge modelling</field><field name="subject">Bioinformedical database</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding value in B2B buyer-seller relationships: do matching expectations improve relationship strength?</field><field name="creator">Konh&#228;user, Andreas</field><field name="description">A typical problem with relationship management in a B2B environment is that implementing companies often see the relationship only from their own perspective. In other words, the supplier decides which customer is worth treating as a key customer, without involving the customer in this decision, or vice versa. As a result, even resource-consuming key account customers might move to competitors if they do not value the relationship in the same way as the supplier and see an opportunity to save costs by switching sources. This study develops a better understanding of value in B2B relationships. It investigates the segmentation methods currently used in relationship management and develops a new approach that brings the value perspectives from buyer and seller together. The major contribution of the research, however, is to test the proposition that congruency of the value expectations of buyer and seller will optimize the relationship strength.In the literature there seem two general approaches, the hard and the soft. This research combines these measures to form a single, cohesive measurement of congruency of relationship value, from the perspective of both partners in the relationship. There is a lacuna in the burgeoning literature on relationship management, where trust is often inadequately represented in the research, and where reciprocity of value between relationship partners is often omitted. This research addresses this critical, yet under-researched, issue. It also provides a useful, practical, guide to companies desirous of setting up strong relationships with other organizations by explaining the importance of soft value measures and focusing on shared value expectations in these relationships.The quantitative survey was conducted among buyers and sellers in small and medium sized companies in Germany that are operating on an international level. The empirical results strongly support the research thesis. Implications for theory and practice are provided as well as recommendations for further research.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Value</field><field name="subject">B2B</field><field name="subject">Buyer-seller relationships</field><field name="subject">Relationship strength</field><field name="subject">Konhauser</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sperm whale diet in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">G&#243;mez-Villota, Felipe</field><field name="description">Stomach contents of 19 mature sperm whales, 18 males and one female, that stranded on New Zealand beaches between the mid 1990s and 2004 were examined, identified and measured. Three of the stomachs were empty. All other samples consisted almost entirely of cephalopod beaks. A total of 23,223 cephalopod beaks (10,647 upper and 12,576 lower), representing at least 36 species in 17 families were found in the remaining 16 stomachs. Non-cephalopod remains in the stomachs of sperm whales stranded in New Zealand included limited quantities of fish, salps, crustacean exoskeletons, a copepod, some wood and sand.The present investigation represents the most comprehensive study of the diet of sperm whales in New Zealand since the early 1960s. The results show that oceanic squid of the families Histioteuthidae, Cranchiidae, Onychoteuthidae and Octopoteuthidae are the most common remains found in the stomachs of sperm whales stranded on New Zealand beaches, with the families Onychoteuthidae, Histioteuthidae, Octopoteuthidae and Architeuthidae being the most important by estimated weight in whale diet, and the families Cranchiidae, Pholidoteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae secondarily so.The beaks of three cephalopod species thought to be restricted to Antarctic waters (Kondakovia longimana, Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni and Psychroteuthis glacialis) were found in 12 of the stomachs, suggesting these whales had recently migrated into New Zealand from more southern feeding grounds. The amount of local cephalopod beaks in the stomachs suggests some of the stranded sperm whales did not feed much within New Zealand waters in the days prior to stranding.The beaks of Taningia danae, Octopoteuthis megaptera, Octopoteuthis sp. 'Giant' and Lepidoteuthis grimaldii are illustrated and described. Oblique and lateral illustrations of the lower beaks are given, as well as sections of the rostrum, jaw angle, shoulder and lateral wall, to show the major identifying features for each of the species.Squid are an important component of food chains in the Southern Ocean and they act as both high-level predators and prey for apex predators. Therefore, seasonal fluctuations in their abundance must have cascading effects on the diets of apex predators. With increasing global fishing effort, and with cephalopods representing over 4% of the global annual catch, there are competing interests between the ocean's top teuthophagous predators and the fishing industry.Uncertainty of the effects fisheries have on the marine ecosystem has stimulated numerous research studies in recent years. However, despite the economic and ecological importance of cephalopods, there are few ecological studies on them or their significance in the trophic systems of the deep-sea and their life cycles and distribution patterns are only now beginning to be understood. Additional dietary studies that investigate the cephalopod composition and size-class structure in the diet of predators are needed to assess their importance in deepsea food webs, and the potential impact that deep-sea fisheries might have on associated and dependant species, namely apex oceanic predators.The results of this study provide the first significant insight into the diet of the sperm whale, one of the most important apex predators in New Zealand waters.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dietary analysis</field><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Sperm whale biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of extrusion conditions on "Die Pick-Up" formed during extrusion of aluminium alloy AA6060</field><field name="creator">Peris, Robbie G</field><field name="description">Extrusion is a continuous solid state deformation process which is widely used in the aluminium industry. The demand for aluminium extrudates are growing and extruders are pressurized to extrude products as fast as possible without lowering the quality of the product. Important extrusion parameters and conditions are exit temperature, extrusion speed and alloy composition. It is widely accepted in extrusion industry that extrusion surface defects increase when the extrusion speed and exit temperature are increased for a constant alloy. One of the major surface defects is the so-called die pick-up and it is presently uncertain if increase with extrusion speed (from a low 25m/min) would result in an increase of the number of die pick-up defect.Die pick-up appears like a scratch mark or comet on the surface of the extrudate which damages the appearance. Previous research suggests that second phase particles, eutectic reactions (555&#176;C - 600&#176;C), extrusion process conditions and die conditions may influence the cause of die pick-up. However the influencing factors for die pick-up are not well established.The research started by determining the lowest melting temperature for AA6060 alloy as this temperature limit the highest temperature above which incipient melting starts. This temperature corresponds to the eutectic melting temperature for AA6060 alloy. Eutectic melting was only detected above 610&#176;C and therefore the exit temperature could be increased to a maximum of 610&#176;C. For an AA6xxx alloy system the lowest melting temperature is 555&#176;C if Mg2Si and excess silicon were present. However as Mg2Si may have fully dissolved into the solid solution, no  reaction can take place.A preliminary investigation was conducted to study the characteristics of the newly installed extrusion control and monitoring system. Through this study the relationship between the set extrusion speed and the actual extrusion speed was established. It was found that the actual extrusion speed was lower than the set extrusion speed and was further complicated by the capacity limit of the extrusion pressure. Exit temperature measurements were accurate, however it was measured about 1m away from the die exit. Experiments were carried out to estimate the exit temperature drop and hence the exit temperature measurements were corrected accordingly.Thus, the aim of the present research was to establish the relationship between die pick-up and extrusion conditions (extrusion speed, exit temperature and die condition) and to propose the likely formation mechanism for die pick-up.In this research AA6060 alloy was used and was extruded at 25m/min, 30m/min, 35m/min, 40m/min and 45m/min. The exit temperature was found to increases from 542&#176;C to 567&#176;C. Three types of die pick-up was identified which were named as normal pick-up, die line pick-up and lump pick-up. Normal pick-up occurred regardless of the extrusion speed and exit temperature; however the amount of normal pick-up did not increase when the extrusion speed was increased. Die line pick-up occurred when the extrusion speed was 45m/min and appeared only on the die lines. Lump pick-up is not significant since it was very rare.AA6060 (0.4%Mg and 0.5%Si) alloy has about 0.27% excess silicon and therefore at 555&#176;C, Mg2Si particles react with aluminium and excess silicon to form liquid. However normal pick-up and die line pick-up still occurred at temperatures lower and higher than 555&#176;C and therefore it confirms that eutectic reactions do not influence formation of pick-up. Therefore die pick-up is most likely to be caused due to a mechanical process rather than a metallurgical process.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extrusion defects</field><field name="subject">Die pickup</field><field name="subject">Aluminium alloy</field><field name="subject">Surface defects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of heat treatment atmosphere on hardening of surface region of H13 tool steel</field><field name="creator">Au, Dominique</field><field name="description">The cost of an aluminium extrusion die accounts for 35-50% of the total extrusion cost, hence it is important to understand the kinetics of extrusion die heat treatment.  The main objective of die heat treatment is to increase the surface hardness so the surface wear property can be enhanced, which extends the die service life.  Before the die material is case hardened by processes such as nitriding, the material is first heat treated to certain hardness.  Thus the aim of this investigation is to understand the kinetics of carbon diffusion during steel austenitzation because it is significant to steel hardness property.H13 hot work tool steel, a well known material used as a die material for its superior mechanical and hardening properties, was used for the analysis of carbon diffusion during austenization.  Samples made of H13 steel were subjected to four different atmospheric conditions: heat treatment without atmospheric control, heat treatment with stainless steel foil wrapping, pack carburization heat treatment and vacuum heat treatment.  Three treatment time ranges were also applied for the carbon diffusion modelling.  Some samples were further treated by gas nitriding to establish the effect of carbon content on the gas nitriding performance.It was found that decarburization occurred when atmospheric control did not take place during the heat treatment process.  Through the carbon diffusion analysis, at austenitizing temperature of 1020&#186;C, the equilibrium surface carbon content at 1020&#186;C was 0.157wt%, with activation energy of carbon in H13 steel of 20,200cal/mol, and carbon diffusivity at 1020&#186;C was 1.97x10-8cm2/s.This study also proved that proper stainless steel foil wrapping on the heat treating material could restrict decarburization process, resulting in a constant hardness profile as vacuum heat treatment does.  However the tempering characteristic between this two heat treatment methods are different to each other.For the pack carburization heat treatment, it was noted that the samples suffered from decarburization at early stage of heat treatment as carbon monoxide level was not adequate for carburization process.Results from the gas nitrided samples showed that the thickness and the hardness of the nitrided layer was independent to the carbon content in H13 steel.  After 2 rounds of gas nitriding process, further nitriding seemed to have no significant effect on the hardness and thickness of the nitrided layer.  Furthermore, the white layer was not observed in the nitrided samples which were heat treated without atmospheric control.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">Quenching</field><field name="subject">Microhardness</field><field name="subject">Chemical activity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PTCR effect in La2CO3 doped BaTiO2 ceramic sensors</field><field name="creator">Puli, Venkata Sreenivas</field><field name="description">The positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) sensors is resistor materials that undergo a sharp change in resistivity at a designed Curie temperature due to its unique structure and chemical composition. This effect serves important control functions in a wide variety of electronic circuitry and similar applications. Conventional calcining of mixed oxides method (CMO) is used for fabricating lanthanum doped barium titanate (BaTiO3) for PTCR behaviour through solid-state-sintering route, at 1100&#176;C, 1350&#176;C. Two batches of samples were fabricated at low and high sintering temperatures of 1100&#176;C, 1350&#176;C respectively. The effect of different concentrations of donor dopant on BaTiO3 on the electrical properties of Ba(1-x)LaxTiO3 with x= 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.0025, 0.003 mol%, is investigated at low sintering temperature. The influence of lantanum doping with Al2O3+SiO2+TiO2 (AST) as sintering aids on the electrical properties of Ba(1-x)LaxTiO3 with x= 0.0005, 0.001, 0.003 mol%, is also investigated. The results of the electrical characterization for the first batch of samples showed an increase in room temperature resistance with increaisng donor concentration. Also the results of the electrical characterization for the second batch of samples also showed the same increase in room temperature resistance with increasing donor concentration. For first batch of sensors the high room temperature resistance keeps the jump small and these materials showed V-shaped NTCR-PTCR multifunctional cryogenic sensor behavior with a strong negative coefficient of resistance effect at room temperature.Where as the second batch of sensors showed few orders of magnitude rise in resistivity values. The La-doped BaTiO3 ceramics co-doped with Mn gives an enhanced PTCR effect which can be exploited for various sensor applications.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ceramic materials - Thermal conductivity</field><field name="subject">Ceramic materials - Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Ceramic materials - Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">Electric conductivity</field><field name="subject">Electric resistance</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation for LEGO Mindstorms robotics</field><field name="creator">Tian, Yuan</field><field name="description">The LEGO&#174; MINDSTORMS&#174; toolkit can be used to help students learn basic programming and engineering concepts. Software that is widely used with LEGO MINDSTORMS is ROBOLAB, developed by Professor Chris Rogers from Tufts University, Boston, United States. It has been adopted in about 10,000 schools in the United States and other countries. It is used to program LEGO MINDSTORMS robotics in its icon-based programming environment. However, this software does not provide debug features for LEGO MINDSTORMS programs. Users cannot test the program before downloading it into LEGO robotics hardware. In this project, we develop a simulator for LEGO MINDSTORMS to simulate the motions of LEGO robotics in a virtual 3D environment. We use ODE (Open Dynamic Engine) and OpenGL, combined with ROBOLAB. The simulator allows users to test their ROBOLAB program before downloading it into the LEGO MINDSTORMS hardware. For users who do not have the hardware, they may use the simulator to learn ROBOLAB programming skills which may be tested and debugged using the simulator. The simulator can track and display program execution as the simulation runs. This helps users to learn and understand basic robotics programming concepts. An introduction to the overall structure and architecture of the simulator is given and is followed by a detailed description of each component in the system. This presents the techniques that are used to implement each feature of the simulator. The discussions based on several test results are then given. This leads to the conclusion that the simulator is able to accurately represent the actions of robots under certain assumptions and conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">graphics</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">LEGO MINDSTORMS</field><field name="subject">ROBOLAB</field><field name="subject">OpenGL</field><field name="subject">ODE</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280210 Simulation and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of stochastic neural networks for approximating random processes</field><field name="creator">Ling, Hong</field><field name="description">Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be viewed as a mathematical model to simulate natural and biological systems on the basis of mimicking the information processing methods in the human brain. The capability of current ANNs only focuses on approximating arbitrary deterministic input-output mappings. However, these ANNs do not adequately represent the variability which is observed in the systems' natural settings as well as capture the complexity of the whole system behaviour. This thesis addresses the development of a new class of neural networks called Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs) in order to simulate internal stochastic properties of systems. Developing a suitable mathematical model for SNNs is based on canonical representation of stochastic processes or systems by means of Karhunen-Lo&#233;ve Theorem. Some successful real examples, such as analysis of full displacement field of wood in compression, confirm the validity of the proposed neural networks. Furthermore, analysis of internal workings of SNNs provides an in-depth view on the operation of SNNs that help to gain a better understanding of the simulation of stochastic processes by SNNs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">approximate identity neural networks</field><field name="subject">digital image correlation</field><field name="subject">Karhunen-Lo&#232;ve theorem</field><field name="subject">stochastic neural networks</field><field name="subject">stochastic processes</field><field name="subject">white noise</field><field name="subject">wood structure</field><field name="subject">wood displacement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of shading and crop load on flavour and aroma compounds in Sauvignon blanc grapes and wine</field><field name="creator">Ford, R. J.</field><field name="description">The effects of crop load and berry exposure on the composition of Marlborough Sauvignon blanc grapes and wine from the Brancott vineyard, Blenheim, were explored. Commercially grown, 2-cane and 4-cane Sauvignon blanc vines were used with a row orientation of north-south. Two exposure treatments were imposed in the following manner: complete leaf removal was undertaken in the fruit zone and 50% shade cloth was erected to give a uniform shading treatment to half the trial vines. Weekly thirty-berry and whole bunch samples were taken from each of the 32 plots with the exception of the veraison period when two samples per week were taken. Vine vigour was assessed using pruning and leaf area per vine data. Harvest occurred on different dates for 2-cane and 4-cane pruned vines so that fruit attained from both treatments had similar &#176;Brix. Fruit was processed at the Lincoln University winery. Must analysis and wine analysis were undertaken. As expected, 4-cane vines had almost double the yield of 2-cane vines. Higher crop load significantly reduced leaf area per shoot and shoot thickness. Lower leaf area to fruit ratio for 4-cane berries resulted in delayed onset of veraison and slowed the rate of sugar accumulation. Crop load, which limited leaf area to fruit ratio, appeared to be the dominant factor in determining timing of grape physiological ripeness as expressed by &#176;Brix over other factors such as fruit exposure. Malic acid, tartaric acid, IPMP (iso-propylmethoxypyrazine) and IBMP (iso-butyl-methoxypyrazine) were lower at equivalent &#176;Brix in 4-cane compared with 2-cane berries. Significantly higher concentrations of quercetin were found in exposed compared to shaded berries. Must analysis showed a significant influence of crop load on berry titratable acidity and pH, reflecting berry ripening results. Exposure significantly increased the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds in 4-cane must yet showed no influence on 2-cane must. After wine processing lower malic acid concentrations in wines made from 100% exposed fruit became evident in lower wine titratable acidity but showed no influence on wine pH. Bentonite addition to wines had a small but statistically significant influence on wine by reducing pH, titratable acidity and alcohol. Bound sulphur concentrations were significantly higher in 4-cane versus 2-cane wines. At harvest, methoxypyrazine levels in grapes and wines were very low; IBMP concentrations where significantly lower than those normally found in Sauvignon blanc wines from Marlborough. This was attributed to the absence of basal leaves from the shoots of ripening berries. The results suggest that leaf area to fruit ratio is a powerful determinant of grape and wine quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sauvignon blanc</field><field name="subject">crop load</field><field name="subject">exposure</field><field name="subject">leaf area</field><field name="subject">canopy structure</field><field name="subject">quercetin</field><field name="subject">methoxypyrazines</field><field name="subject">thiols</field><field name="subject">&#176;Brix</field><field name="subject">organic acids</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">bentonite</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological correlates of bird damage in a Canterbury vineyard</field><field name="creator">Watkins, Nigel G.</field><field name="description">Birds are a major pest in vineyards both in New Zealand and overseas. There is a need for new behavioural research on birds' foraging habits and feeding preferences in vineyards, as much of the literature to date is anecdotal. Research on cues to birds' feeding will provide a basis on which new deterrent and control strategies can be devised. Spatial-and temporal bird damage in a small vineyard block was mapped to find if damage was correlated with grape maturity and environmental factors. Vineyard and field observations of bird behaviour using video technology combined with preference experiments aimed to establish the relative roles of grape sugar concentration and colour in avian selection. Proximity of vineyards to bird roosts affects damage levels, regardless of differing maturity between locations. The rate of damage tends to increase exponentially once grape maturity has passed a threshold of 13 &#176;Brix. Bunches positioned closest to the ground receive more damage if blackbirds or song thrushes are the predominant pests. Both sugar concentration and grape colour were found to affect birds' feeding preference, but the importance of the two factors varied between years. Black and green grape varieties were differentially preferred by blackbirds (Turdus merula) and song thrushes (Turdus philomelos) while silvereyes (Zosterops lateralis) appeared to have no strong colour preference. It was apparent that there were other, not assessed, grape factors that also affect selection. In small unprotected vineyards that are adjacent to bird roosts the entire grape crop can be taken by bird pests. Besides removing the roosts, which can be beneficial shelterbelts in regions exposed to high winds, growers currently may have no alternative other than to use exclusion netting to keep crops intact. The differential preferences between bird species for variety characteristics suggest that any new deterrents and other strategies to deflect birds from grape crops may need to be species-specific.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bird damage</field><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">vineyard management</field><field name="subject">preference</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">sugar concentration</field><field name="subject">bird behaviour</field><field name="subject">foraging strategy</field><field name="subject">European blackbird</field><field name="subject">Turdus merula</field><field name="subject">Song thrush</field><field name="subject">Turdus philomelos</field><field name="subject">Silvereye</field><field name="subject">Zosterops lateralis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing ecosystem services in vineyards to improve the management of Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="creator">Jacometti, Marco Alexander Azon</field><field name="description">Organic mulches and cover crops mulched in situ were assessed for their effects on B. cinerea primary inoculum and disease levels in inflorescences at flowering and/or bunches at harvest. Organic mulches were used to enhance biological degradation of vine debris to reduce levels of B. cinerea primary inoculum the following season. Four mulch types (anaerobically and aerobically fermented marc (grape pressings), inter-row grass clippings and shredded office paper) were applied under ten-year-old Riesling vines in a ten-replicate randomized block design in New Zealand over two consecutive years. Plastic mesh bags, each containing naturally infected vine debris, were placed under vines on bare ground (control) and at the soil-mulch interface, in winter (July) 2003 and 2004. In each year, half the bags were recovered at flowering (December) and the remainder at leaf plucking (February), for assessment of B. cinerea sporulation from the vine debris and debris degradation rate. Bait lamina probes, which measure soil biological activity, were placed in the soil-mulch interface three weeks before each of the two bag-recovery dates in both years and were then removed and assessed at the same times as were the bags. All mulches led to a reduction in B. cinerea sporulation. This reduction was significantly correlated with elevated rates of vine debris decomposition and increased soil biological activity. Over both years, compared with the controls, all treatments gave a 3-20-fold reduction in B. cinerea sporulation, a 1.6-2.6-fold increase in vine debris degradation and in the two marc and the paper treatments, a 1.8-4-fold increase in activity of soil organisms. The mulches also altered vine characteristics and elevated their resistance to B. cinerea through changes to the soil environment. Functional soil biological activity, as measured by Biolog Ecoplates and bait lamina probes, was increased 2-4 times in the two marc and paper treatments, compared with the control, an effect relating to the elevated soil moisture and reduced temperature fluctuations under these mulches. Soil nutrient levels and the C:N ratios were also affected in these treatments. The mulched paper lowered vine canopy density by up to 1.4 times that of the other treatments, an effect which probably led to elevated light penetration into the canopy and consequent increased canopy temperature, photosynthesis and lowered canopy humidity. These changes to soil and vine characteristics increased grape skin strength by up to 10% in the paper treatment and sugar concentrations by 1.2-1.4 &#176;Brix in the two marc and paper treatments. The severity of B. cinerea infections in the anaerobic marc, aerobic marc and paper treatments were reduced to 12%, 3% and 2.2% of the control, respectively, in field assessments averaged over two consecutive harvests. Cover crops mulched in situ had similar effects to those of the organic mulches, increasing soil biological activity and reducing B. cinerea primary inoculum and the severity of B. cinerea infection in grapes at harvest (2006). Inter-row phacelia and ryegrass were mulched in winter 2005 and compared with a bare ground control, under 10-year-old Chardonnay vines in a ten-replicate randomized block design. Functional soil biological activity increased by 1.5-4.5 times in the two cover crop treatments compared with the control, an effect possibly related to elevated soil moisture in these treatments. This increase in soil moisture and soil biological activity increased vine debris degradation, reduced B. cinerea primary inoculum on the debris and decreased B. cinerea severity at flowering (December 2005) and harvest (April 2006). These results show the potential of organic mulches and cover crops mulched in situ to enhance soil ecosystem services and improve the sustainability of viticultural practices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="subject">cover crop</field><field name="subject">mulch</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">soil biological activity</field><field name="subject">vine debris degradation</field><field name="subject">primary inoculum</field><field name="subject">grape vines</field><field name="subject">vine resistance</field><field name="subject">yield</field><field name="subject">grape quality</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model system using insects to vector Fusarium tumidum for biological control of gorse (Ulex europaeus)</field><field name="creator">Yamoah, Emmanuel</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that insects can vector F. tumidum conidia to infect gorse plants with the aim of developing an alternative approach to mycoherbicide delivery to control weeds. Four potential insect species (Apion ulicis, Cydia ulicetana, Epiphyas postvittana and Sericothrips staphylinus) were assessed for their ability to vector F. tumidum conidia. To achieve this, the external microflora (bacteria and fungi) and the size and location of fungal spores on the cuticle of these insect species were determined. In addition, the ability of the insects to pick up and deposit F. tumidum conidia on agar was studied. Based on the results from these experiments, E. postvittana was selected for more detailed experiments to determine transmission of F. tumidum to infect potted gorse plants. The factors promoting pathogenicity of F. tumidum against gorse and the pathogen loading required to infect and kill the weed were also determined. The external microflora of the four insect species were recovered by washing and plating techniques and identified by morphology and polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and sequencing of internally transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S rDNA. A culture-independent technique (direct PCR) was also used to assess fungal diversity by direct amplification of ITS sequences from the washings of the insects. All insect species carried Alternaria, Cladosporium, Nectria, Penicillium, Phoma, Pseudozyma spp. and entomopathogens. Ninety four per cent of the 178 cloned amplicons had ITS sequences similarity to Nectria mauritiicola. E. postvittana carried the largest fungal spores (mean surface area of 125.9 &#181;m&#178;) and the most fungal CFU/insect. About 70% of the fungi isolated from the insects were also present on the host plant (gorse) and the understorey grass. The mean size of fungal spores recovered from the insect species correlated strongly with their body length (R&#178; = 85%). Methylobacterium aquaticum and Pseudomonas lutea were common on all four insect species. Pseudomonas fluorescens was the most abundant bacterial species. In the pathogenicity trials, the effectiveness of F. tumidum in reducing root and shoot biomass of 16 and 8 wk old gorse plants was significantly increased with wounding of the plants. Older plants (32 wk old) which were wounded and inoculated were significantly shorter, more infected and developed more tip dieback (80%) than plants which were not wounded (32%). This indicates that damage caused by phytophagous insect species present on gorse through feeding and oviposition may enhance infection by F. tumidum. Wounding may release nutrients (e.g. Mg and Zn) essential for conidia germination and germ tube elongation and also provide easier access for germ tube penetration. Conidial germination and germ tube length were increased by 50 and 877%, respectively when incubated in 0.2% of gorse extract solution for 24 h compared with incubation in water. Inoculum suspensions amended with 0.2% of gorse extract caused more infection and significantly reduced biomass production of 24 wk old gorse plants than suspensions without gorse extract. A minimum number of about 900 viable conidia/infection site of F. tumidum were required to infect gorse leaves. However, incorporation of amendments (which can injure the leaf cuticle) or provision of nutrients (i.e. gorse extract or glucose) in the formulation might decrease the number of conidia required for lesion formation. Scanning electron micrographs showed that germ tube penetration of gorse tissue was limited to open stomata which partly explain the large number of conidia required for infection. The flowers and leaves were more susceptible to F. tumidum infection than the spines, stems and pods. An experiment to determine the number of infection sites required to cause plant mortality showed that the entire plant needs to be inoculated in order for the pathogen to kill 10 wk old plants as F. tumidum is a non systemic pathogen. The number of infection sites correlated strongly with disease severity (R&#178; = 99.3%). At least 50% of the plant was required to be inoculated to cause a significant reduction in shoot dry weight. F. tumidum, applied as soil inoculant using inoculated wheat grains in three separate experiments, significantly suppressed gorse seedling emergence and biomass production. In experiments to determine the loading capacity of the insect species, E. postvittana, the largest insect species studied, carried significantly more (68) and deposited significantly more (29) F. tumidum conidia than the other species. Each E. postvittana, loaded with 5,000 conidia of F. tumidum, transmitted approximately 310 conidia onto gorse plants but this did not cause any infection or affect plant growth as determined by shoot fresh weight and shoot height. E. postvittana on its own did not cause any significant damage to gorse and did not enhance F. tumidum infection. It also failed to spread the pathogen from infected plants to the healthy ones. There was no evidence of synergism between the two agents and damage caused by the combination of both E. postvittana and F. tumidum was equivalent to that caused by F. tumidum alone. This study has shown that E. postvittana has the greatest capacity to vector F. tumidum since it naturally carried the largest and the most fungal spores (429 CFU/insect). Moreover, it naturally carried Fusarium spp. such as F. lateritium, F. tricinctum and Gibberella pulicaris (anamorph Fusarium sambucinum) and was capable of carrying and depositing most F. tumidum conidia on agar. Coupled with the availability of pheromone for attracting the male insects, E. postvittana may be a suitable insect vector for delivering F. tumidum conidia on gorse using this novel biocontrol strategy. Although it is a polyphagous insect, and may visit non-target plants, F. tumidum is a very specific pathogen of gorse, broom and a few closely related plant species. Hence, using this insect species to vector F. tumidum in a biological control programme, should not pose a significant threat to plants of economic importance. However, successful control of gorse using this "lure-load-infect" concept would depend, to a large extent on the virulence of the pathogen as insects, due to the large size of F. tumidum macroconidia, can carry only a small number of it.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fusarium tumidum</field><field name="subject">insect microflora</field><field name="subject">PCR-RFLP</field><field name="subject">ITS</field><field name="subject">16S rDNA</field><field name="subject">mycoherbicide</field><field name="subject">gorse</field><field name="subject">biological control</field><field name="subject">wounding</field><field name="subject">insect vectors</field><field name="subject">lure-load-infect</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unstable equilibrium : modelling waves and turbulence in water flow</field><field name="creator">Connell, R. J.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a one-dimensional version of a new data driven model of turbulence that uses the KL expansion to provide a spectral solution of the turbulent flow field based on analysis of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) turbulent data. The analysis derives a 2nd order random field over the whole flow domain that gives better turbulence properties in areas of non-uniform flow and where flow separates than the present models that are based on the Navier-Stokes Equations. These latter models need assumptions to decrease the number of calculations to enable them to run on present day computers or super-computers. These assumptions reduce the accuracy of these models. The improved flow field is gained at the expense of the model not being generic. Therefore the new data driven model can only be used for the flow situation of the data as the analysis shows that the kernel of the turbulent flow field of undular hydraulic jump could not be related to the surface waves, a key feature of the jump. The kernel developed has two parts, called the outer and inner parts. A comparison shows that the ratio of outer kernel to inner kernel primarily reflects the ratio of turbulent production to turbulent dissipation. The outer part, with a larger correlation length, reflects the larger structures of the flow that contain most of the turbulent energy production. The inner part reflects the smaller structures that contain most turbulent energy dissipation.  The new data driven model can use a kernel with changing variance and/or regression coefficient over the domain, necessitating the use of both numerical and analytical methods. The model allows the use of a two-part regression coefficient kernel, the solution being the addition of the result from each part of the kernel. This research highlighted the need to assess the size of the structures calculated by the models based on the Navier-Stokes equations to validate these models. At present most studies use mean velocities and the turbulent fluctuations to validate a models performance. As the new data driven model gives better turbulence properties, it could be used in complicated flow situations, such as a rock groyne to give better assessment of the forces and pressures in the water flow resulting from turbulence fluctuations for the design of such structures. Further development to make the model usable includes; solving the numerical problem associated with the double kernel, reducing the number of modes required, obtaining a solution for the kernel of two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows, including the change in correlation length with time as presently the model gives instant realisations of the flow field and finally including third and fourth order statistics to improve the data driven model velocity field from having Gaussian distribution properties. As the third and fourth order statistics are Reynolds Number dependent this will enable the model to be applied to PIV data from physical scale models. In summary, this new data driven model is complementary to models based on the Navier-Stokes equations by providing better results in complicated design situations. Further research to develop the new model is viewed as an important step forward in the analysis of river control structures such as rock groynes that are prevalent on New Zealand Rivers protecting large cities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data driven model</field><field name="subject">turbulence</field><field name="subject">surface waves</field><field name="subject">undular hydraulic jump</field><field name="subject">kernel</field><field name="subject">Karhunen-Lo&#233;ve</field><field name="subject">Proper Orthogonal Decomposition</field><field name="subject">random flow field</field><field name="subject">regression coefficient function</field><field name="subject">covariance</field><field name="subject">stochastic</field><field name="subject">Navier-Stokes equations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290802 Water and sanitary engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291101 Environmental engineering modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of environmental stressors on the immune response to avian infectious bronchitis virus</field><field name="creator">Lopez, Juan Carlos</field><field name="description">The first aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of IBV in broilers within the Canterbury province, New Zealand, in late winter and to search for associations with management or environmental factors. The second aim was to study how ambient stressors affect the immune system in birds, their adaptive capacity to respond, and the price that they have to pay in order to return to homeostasis. In a case control study, binary logistic regression analyses were used to seek associations between the presence of IBV in broilers and various risk factors that had been linked in other studies to the presence of different avian pathogens: ambient ammonia, oxygen, carbon dioxide, humidity and litter humidity. Pairs of sheds were selected from ten large broiler farms in Canterbury. One shed (case) from each pair contained poultry that had a production or health alteration that suggested the presence of IBV and the other was a control shed. Overall, IBV was detected by RT-PCR in 50% of the farms. In 2 of the 5 positive farms (but none of the control sheds) where IBV was detected there were accompanying clinical signs that suggested infectious bronchitis (IB). Ambient humidity was the only risk factor that showed an association (inverse) with the prevalence of IBV (p = 0.05; OR = 0.92). It was concluded within the constraints of the totally enclosed management systems described, that humidity had an influence on the presence of IBV, but temperature, ammonia, carbon dioxide, oxygen or litter humidity had no effect. In another study environmental temperatures were changed in order to affect the biological function and adaptive capacity of chickens following infection with IBV. The 'affective states' of the animal were assessed by measuring levels of corticosterone (CORT) in plasma and tonic immobility (TI). It was found that low (10 +/- 2&#176;C) and high (30 +/- 2&#176;C) temperatures exacerbated the respiratory signs and lesions in birds infected with IBV as compared to those housed at moderate (20 +/- 2&#176;C) temperatures. The chickens housed at high temperatures showed significantly decreased growth, a higher proportion of hepatic lesions (principally haemorrhages) and a longer tonic immobility period, but there was no significant alteration in the plasma levels of CORT. The birds housed at low temperatures developed a higher proportion of heart lesions (hydropericardium, ventricular hypertrophy) and had significantly higher levels of plasma CORT than birds housed under moderate and/or high temperatures. The specific antibody response to IBV decreased in birds housed under high temperatures. Interestingly the birds housed at high temperatures developed significantly higher levels of haemagglutinin antibodies to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) than those birds housed under low or moderated temperatures. Cell mediated immunity was not significantly affected by heat or cold stress in the first 13 days of treatment but at 20 days the levels of interferon gamma in the birds subjected to low temperatures were lower than in the high temperature group. In other trials, the exogenous administration of low physiological doses of oral CORT (as compared to high pharmacological doses typically used in such experiments) to birds resulted in suppression or enhancement of the immune response depending on duration of treatment and/or dose and nature of the antigen. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that exogenous CORT can produce an enhancement in the immune response in chickens. iv In conclusion, environmental stressors such as high or low temperatures do affect the physiology of the fast-growing broiler. The adjustments the birds have to make to maintain homeostasis impacts on the course of common infectious diseases, such as IB, that normally is mild in the New Zealand poultry industry. The administration of exogenous CORT showed that this hormone may be part of the physiological stress response and acts as a messenger to prepare the immune system for potential challenges (e.g., infection).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus</field><field name="subject">IBV</field><field name="subject">broiler chickens</field><field name="subject">immune system</field><field name="subject">environmental stress</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">immune response</field><field name="subject">corticosterone</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300510 Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is New Zealand the right choice? : the psychological and social factors influencing the decision for German immigrants to New Zealand to stay in New Zealand or to return to Germany : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">B&#252;rgelt , Petra  Topaz</field><field name="description">This thesis has developed a local theory of German immigration to New Zealand by exploring the experiences of migrants throughout the whole migration process, the particular meaning they assigned to their experiences, and how these experiences were influenced by cultural and historical context. This local theory identifies the psychological and social factors, and the interrelations between them, that contribute to resilience and adaptation or to vulnerability and poor adaptation, and that influence the decision whether to stay in New Zealand or to return to Germany.To gain these insights, this research drew on the theoretical perspectives of the salutogenic paradigm, social interactionism, and social constructionism in narrative theory; and adapted a grounded theory methodology. The study sampled social artifacts, with particular emphasis on actions/interactions, narratives, and answers to concrete questions. Eight German immigrant couples, four who live in New Zealand and decided to stay in New Zealand (stayers) and four who had immigrated to New Zealand, but decided to return to Germany and live now in Germany (returners), were interviewed in-depth via episodic interviews. The interview data was complemented with data from participant observation, the latest census, and the history of German settlement in New Zealand in order to capture the context of the immigration experiences. The data gathered was analysed by using grounded theory analysis strategies.The processes that underpin decisions to migrate, decisions to remain, and decisions to return are discussed. The most important psychosocial process influencing the experiences of German immigrants to New Zealand was 'Living the Dream'. The migration process presented many different and substantial challenges simultaneously. Thus, stress was an inevitable aspect of the migration process. Each sub-phase of the migration process influenced, and was influenced by, individual characteristics and values, beliefs/attitudes, strategies, and the social conditions in Germany, New Zealand, and Britain. These psychosocial factors, in turn, interacted with one another also. Taken together, these psychosocial factors either increased the likelihood of staying or of returning. Regardless of whether German immigrants stayed or returned, dealing with the challenges and the associated stress acted as a force for exhilarated evolvement, which was linked to the characteristics that prompted their initial migration decision. The experiences, interpretations, and outcomes of female and male German immigrants were remarkably similar. However,some gender differences were identified. The study provides detailed recommendations that aim at providing resource structures that assist German immigrants to unfold their potential, to learn as much as possible, and to evolve and adapt.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">migration; immigration; New Zealand; Germany; psychosocial factors; adaptation</field><field name="subject">Psychology, General (0621)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relating Maori and pakeha : the politics of indigenous and settler identities : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bell, Avril</field><field name="description">Settler colonisation produced particular colonial subjects: indigene and settler. The specificity of the relationship between these subjects lies in the act of settlement; an act of colonial violence by which the settler physically and symbolically displaces the indigene, but never totally. While indigenes may be physically displaced from their territories, they continue to occupy a marginal location within the settler nation-state. Symbolically, as settlers set out to distinguish themselves from the metropolitan 'motherlands', indigenous cultures become a rich, 'native' source of cultural authenticity to ground settler nationalisms. The result is a complex of conflictual and ambivalent relations between settler and indigene.This thesis investigates the ongoing impact of this colonial relation on the contemporary identities and relations of Maori (indigene) and Pakeha (settlers) in Aotearoa New Zealand. It centres on the operation of discursive strategies used by both Maori and Pakeha in constructing their identities and the relationship between them. I analyse 'found' texts - non-fiction books, media and academic texts - to identify discourse 'at work', as New Zealanders make and reflect on their identity claims. This investigation has two aims. Firstly, I map the terrain of discursive strategies that bear the traces of colonial domination and resistance. Secondly, I seek to explore the possibilities for replacing colonial relations with non-dominating forms of relationship between Maori and Pakeha.The thesis is in two parts. Part I focuses on theories of identity, centring on essentialism and hybridity. I argue that both modes of theorising bear the traces of colonial relations and neither offers the means to 'escape' colonial relations. Part II focuses on theories of intersubjectivity, bringing relationality to the fore. I argue that epistemological relations (including identity relations) always involve a degree of violence and exclusion and that, consequently, these necessary relations must be held in tension with an awareness of the ethical dimension of intersubjective engagement. Utilising the ethics of Emmanuel L&#233;vinas, I argue that a combination of an ethical orientation towards the other and a 'disappointed' orientation towards politics and epistemology, offers the means to developing non-dominating relations with the cultural other.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pakeha</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">colonialism</field><field name="subject">L&#233;vinas</field><field name="subject">370103 Race and ethnic relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some physiological changes in female athletes during and after exercise : investigating the use of a new, low-invasive sampling method (electrosonophoresis) : a thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Exercise Physiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Purnell, Heather Margaret</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to monitor cardiovascular and endocrine changes in sedentary and training females during a six week period, and to assess the accuracy of a new, low-invasive sampling methodology (electrosonophoresis). Changes in fitness were measured using oxygen consumption (VO2). The impact on VO2 of sleep quality, sleep duration and alcohol consumption (recorded in sleep logs) was assessed. Cortisol, testosterone and growth hormone levels in plasma were monitored for acute changes following fitness tests, and chronic changes related to training, oral contraceptive use or alcohol consumption. Hormone concentrations in blood and saliva samples were compared to those in interstitial fluid (obtained using electrosonophoresis) to investigate the accuracy of electrosonophoresis. Mean VO2 increased by 3.3 &#177; 1.3mL/kg/min between Week 1 and Week 5 and the changes detected in heart rate (HR) during the fitness tests suggest that aerobic fitness of the training participants increased across the study. No significant associations between sleep quality, sleep duration or alcohol consumption and VO2 were detected. No acute changes in plasma hormone concentrations following fitness tests were detected. No chronic changes in plasma cortisol or testosterone concentrations were detected, although a non-significant trend towards increased plasma GH levels in training participants was detected. Resting plasma cortisol levels were significantly lower in oral contraceptive users compared with non-users. Plasma testosterone and growth hormone levels were unaffected by oral contraceptive use. Alcohol consumption had no acute detectable effects on plasma concentrations of the three hormones. Plasma testosterone levels were higher in participants who abstained from alcohol, and higher plasma growth hormone levels were detected in heavy drinkers. These results contrast with published reports. Concentrations of the three hormones in interstitial fluid and plasma exhibited highly significant positive correlations (r2 &gt; 0.98) with an interstitial fluid:plasma concentration ratio of about 1:10 in each case. Equations to predict plasma concentrations of cortisol, testosterone and growth hormone from interstitial fluid concentrations have been derived. The electrosonophoretic method apparently provides an accurate, painless, low-invasive method for prediction of the plasma levels of these three hormones. This technology has far-reaching implications for research in human, animal and biomedical fields.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cortisol</field><field name="subject">growth hormone</field><field name="subject">testosterone</field><field name="subject">female</field><field name="subject">athlete</field><field name="subject">blood</field><field name="subject">321401 Exercise physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maori and museums : the politics of indigenous recognition : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Museum Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Butts, David James</field><field name="description">As a result of colonialism indigenous peoples have been marginalised within their own customary territories. In an analysis of the politics of cultural recognition Tully (1995) proposes the reconceptualisation of the 'common ground': sites, including public museums, within which different cultures negotiate their relationships within the modern nation-state, where the rights of indigenous peoples can be recognised on the basis of the principles of mutual recognition, continuity and consent. This thesis examines the impact of the politics of indigenous recognition on the evolving relationships between M&#228;ori and museums, focusing on M&#228;ori participation in the governance of regional charitable trust museums in New Zealand.The international context is explored through an investigation of indigenous strategies of resistance to museum practices at the international, national and local levels. The national context within which M&#228;ori resistance to museum practices has evolved, and subsequent changes in practice are then outlined.Two case studies of regional charitable trust museums, which began to renegotiate M&#228;ori participation in their governance structures in the late 1990s, are examined. The different governance models adopted by Whanganui Regional Museum, Whanganui, and Tairawhiti Museum, Gisborne, both effected major shifts from the historical pattern of limited M&#228;ori participation in the museums to the representation of all tangata whenua iwi on the new trust boards. The governance negotiation processes and the responses of interested parties are analysed. The case studies demonstrate the importance of understanding the historical context within which public institutions are embedded and the forces that lead to contemporary adjustments in power relationships.Both new governance models have resulted in genuine power sharing partnerships between tangata whenua and the museums. Finally, the extent to which the two institutions have subsequently moved towards becoming 'common ground' where the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples can be realised is analysed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">museums and minorities</field><field name="subject">cultural property</field><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of prolactin in the control of ovine lactogenesis : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Samuel Walter</field><field name="description">A series of trials was carried out to examine the role of prolactin (PRL) in the control of lactogenesis in New Zealand Romney x Border Leicester ewes. In addition, a study was made of differences in milk yields and plasma PRL concentrations between spring- and autumn-lambing ewes.Daily subcutaneous injections of 2 mg CB154 inhibited PRL secretion and delayed lactogenesis. There were no consistent effects on plasma progesterone or insulin concentrations. CB154 treatment was more effective in reducing milk yield in twin-bearing than in single-bearing ewes when used for 20 days than for 9 days prepartum. The differential effects on milk yield cannot be explained by corresponding effects on plasma PRL or insulin concentrations. Circulating PRL during the period 20 to 10 days prepartum may have an important effect on milk yield in twin- but not single-bearing ewes.Subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mg/kg live weight oPRL, administered on 2 consecutive days peripartum, to ewes treated with CB154 for 7 days prepartum, resulted in milk yields similar to those in control ewes and significantly (P&lt;0.01) greater than those in ewes treated with CB154 alone. This indicated that oPRL prevented the CB154-induced reduction of milk yields and has established that the effect of CB154 on lactogenesis is mediated through suppression of PRL secretion and not by effects on some other hormone.Injection of 10 mg oPRL directly into one mammary gland (via the teat duct) increased milk yields relative to the contralateral, bicarbonate-treated gland in CB154-treated ewes. The intramammary oPRL injection did not raise circulating PRL concentrations. Furthermore, the milk yields of bicarbonate-treated glands in ewes treated with bicarbonate only, did not differ from those of bicarbonate-treated glands in ewes treated with oPRL in the contralateral gland, demonstrating that there were no effects of oPRL, transferred via the circulation from the treated gland, on the contralateral gland. Glands treated with oPRL produced 15% (P&lt;0.05) more milk than the bicarbonate-treated glands during the first 8 days of lactation and the difference was maintained throughout the 8-week lactation period, indicating that the oPRL had effected a permanent change in the ability of the gland to produce milk. It is concluded that PRL acts directly on the mammary gland without the need for a putative intermediate hormone, and that intramammary PRL concentrations during lactogenesis may have long-lasting effects on lactation.The possibility was examined that dietary differences were responsible for seasonal differences in plasma PRL concentrations, milk yields, milk composition, lamb birthweight and lamb growth rate, observed in earlier trials. Mean plasma PRL levels were significantly (P&lt;0.01) higher in spring- (192&#177;38 ng/ml) than in autumn- (71&#177;17 ng/ml) lambing ewes housed indoors under constant photoperiod (18L:6D) and fed the same diet. Milk yields were also significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher in the spring- (2041&#177;114 g/d) than in the autumn- (1563&#177;109 g/d) lambing ewes over the 8 day lactation. Lamb growth rates (adjusted for birthweight, birthrank and sex of lamb) from birth to 8 weeks of age were significantly (P&lt;0.001) higher in spring (282&#177;12 g/d) than in autumn (225&#177;15 g/d). The seasonal differences were confounded with corresponding differences in ewe live weight and it was not possible to determine whether dietary differences contributed significantly to the differences observed.Two routes of oPRL supplementation were used to test the effectiveness of elevating peripheral or local levels of PRL in autumn-lambing ewes which, based on previous results, were expected to have low plasma PRL concentrations and milk yields relative to spring-lambing ewes. Administration of 10 mg supplementary oPRL directly into the gland or subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg/kg oPRL did not increase the milk yields, or change the composition of milk, compared to controls. These results suggest that the circulating level of PRL, and the intramammary concentration of PRL, in autumn-lambing ewes are not limiting lactogenesis. Because the plasma prolactin concentration in the ewes was unexpectedly high, it was not possible to reach firm conclusions regarding possible effects of supplementary oPRL in ewes with naturally low plasma PRL concentrations. Nevertheless, the results indicate that raising the intramammary concentration of PRL around the time of parturition, in ewes with circulating PRL levels characteristic of normal spring-lambing ewes, does not enhance lactogenesis.It is concluded that PRL is important to the complete initiation of lactogenesis in ewes, that it acts directly on the gland and that it is necessary for establishing the maximum potential of the gland to secrete milk.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prolactin</field><field name="subject">lactogenesis</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">ovine</field><field name="subject">milk</field><field name="subject">bromocriptine</field><field name="subject">300505 Anatomy and physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal design of data warehouse and OLAP systems : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Jane Qiong</field><field name="description">A data warehouse is a single data store, where data from multiple data sources is integrated for online business analytical processing (OLAP) of an entire organisation. The rationale being single and integrated is to ensure a consistent view of the organisational business performance independent from different angels of business perspectives. Due to its wide coverage of subjects, data warehouse design is a highly complex, lengthy and error-prone process. Furthermore, the business analytical tasks change over time, which results in changes in the requirements for the OLAP systems. Thus, data warehouse and OLAP systems are rather dynamic and the design process is continuous. In this thesis, we propose a method that is integrated, formal and application-tailored to overcome the complexity problem, deal with the system dynamics, improve the quality of the system and the chance of success. Our method comprises three important parts: the general ASMs method with types, the application tailored design framework for data warehouse and OLAP, and the schema integration method with a set of provably correct refinement rules. By using the ASM method, we are able to model both data and operations in a uniform conceptual framework, which enables us to design an integrated approach for data warehouse and OLAP design. The freedom given by the ASM method allows us to model the system at an abstract level that is easy to understand for both users and designers. More specifically, the language allows us to use the terms from the user domain not biased by the terms used in computer systems. The pseudo-code like transition rules, which gives the simplest form of operational semantics in ASMs, give the closeness to programming languages for designers to understand. Furthermore, these rules are rooted in mathematics to assist in improving the quality of the system design. By extending the ASMs with types, the modelling language is tailored for data warehouse with the terms that are well developed for data-intensive applications, which makes it easy to model the schema evolution as refinements in the dynamic data warehouse design. By providing the application-tailored design framework, we break down the design complexity by business processes (also called subjects in data warehousing) and design concerns. By designing the data warehouse by subjects, our method resembles Kimball's "bottom-up" approach. However, with the schema integration method, our method resolves the stovepipe issue of the approach. By building up a data warehouse iteratively in an integrated framework, our method not only results in an integrated data warehouse, but also resolves the issues of complexity and delayed ROI (Return On Investment) in Inmon's "top-down" approach. By dealing with the user change requests in the same way as new subjects, and modelling data and operations explicitly in a three-tier architecture, namely the data sources, the data warehouse and the OLAP (online Analytical Processing), our method facilitates dynamic design with system integrity. By introducing a notion of refinement specific to schema evolution, namely schema refinement, for capturing the notion of schema dominance in schema integration, we are able to build a set of correctness-proven refinement rules. By providing the set of refinement rules, we simplify the designers's work in correctness design verification. Nevertheless, we do not aim for a complete set due to the fact that there are many different ways for schema integration, and neither a prescribed way of integration to allow designer favored design. Furthermore, given its &#176;exibility in the process, our method can be extended for new emerging design issues easily.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data warehousing</field><field name="subject">data mining</field><field name="subject">database design</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying variation in estimated methane emission from ruminants using the SF6 tracer technique : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vlaming, Johannes Bernardus</field><field name="description">With the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand must reduce its national greenhouse gas emissions. As New Zealand has a large proportion of its national emissions as methane (~31%), and methane (CH4) has a short atmospheric lifetime, it provides a good target for mitigation strategies. The initial aim of this research was to identify high and low CH4-emitting cattle to assess factors that contribute to low CH4 production. Initial studies using the SF6 tracer technique to estimate CH4 production could not identify consistently high and low CH4 emitters. Research was therefore undertaken to confirm whether this was due to high variation in estimated CH4 yields, and to quantify the within- and between-animal variation in CH4 production when using the SF6 technique. This research showed considerable within- (coefficient of variation, CV = 7-10%) and between-animal (CV = 7-18%) variation in CH4 yield (g CH4/kg DMI) over time when using the SF6 technique. This is larger than the within- (CV = 3%) and between-animal (CV = 10%) variation reported for calorimetry. This led to the recommendation that the SF6 technique not be used in identifying animals for high or low CH4 yield. A power analysis was developed based on the measured variances for the SF6 technique. Results from this analysis provide researchers with important information on the number of animals and measurements per animal required when undertaking CH4 experiments. One of the sources of variation with the SF6 technique is the SF6 release from permeation tubes. Estimated CH4 yield increases by approximately 8.5% when going from a release rate of 3 mg SF6/day to a rate of 5 mg SF6/day. Further, an in vitro study indicated that SF6 release from permeation tubes is approximately 8% lower in rumen fluid than in air. While further research is required to confirm these results, they emphasise the need to allow time for the release rate to stabilise in the rumen for 4-5 days prior to undertaking measurements. It also led to the recommendation that release rates used in experiments should be within a narrow range, and balanced across experimental treatments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">methane emissions</field><field name="subject">greenhouse gas emissions</field><field name="subject">ruminants</field><field name="subject">methane production</field><field name="subject">variability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270603 Animal physiology-systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transferring ascochyta blight resistance from Lathyrus sp. into field pea (Pisum sativum L.) via protoplast fusion (somatic hybridisation)</field><field name="creator">McCutchan, Jennifer Susan</field><field name="description">Field pea (Pisum sativum L.) is highly susceptible to ascochyta blight, primarily caused by the pathogen Mycosphaerella pinodes (Berk. &amp; Blox.)

The work reported in this thesis aimed to develop the various techniques that would be required to transfer ascochyta blight resistance from grasspea into field pea via somatic hybridisation. This thesis also assesses the feasibility of achieving this goal. Field pea shoot cultures were established on hormone-free MS medium, and a protoplast isolation protocol developed for both species. Grasspea shoot cultures were established on both RL and SSB8 medium. Friable grasspea callus was achieved on media supplemented with 2,4-D in the range 4.523 &#181;M, whereas kinetin tested at any concentration did not appear to influence callus growth. A suspension culture of grasspea was developed for the first time, in B5 medium supplemented with 4.5 &#181;M 2,4-D and 0.5 &#181;M kinetin. Grasspea protoplasts were isolated from both in vitro seedlings and suspension cultures.

MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxy-methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assay performed on human cells (HepG2 and Skin fibroblasts). The project included the development of a method for extracting contaminants from soil based on leaching and centrifugation. A number of solvents and surfactants were assessed for their suitability as extracting agents. The Zwitterionic surfactant CHAPS ({3[(3-Cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] propanesulphonic acid}), which is an irritant in vivo, was found suitable for in vitro toxicity assessment applications. CHAPS was found to be the least toxic surfactant in vitro when tested on skin fibroblasts (NOEC: 1800??577 ppm, IC50: 4000??577 ppm) and HepG2 cells (NOEC: 833??289 ppm, IC50: 5300??287 ppm). The chosen surfactant was used in three different methods for extraction of Toluene and Xylene spiked in 2 g and 10g soil. The combination comprising of 0.1% (s/w) CHAPS and cosolvent 1% (w/w) Isopropanol, at their respective NOEC (No Observed Effective Concentration) toxicity values, showed good recovery of the nonpolar organic compounds in comparison to the recovery by 0.1% CHAPS and 0.5% CHAPS. The study found additive interactions to be the most common form of toxicity for 16 concentration combinations of Formaldehyde (polar), Toluene and Xylene (nonpolar) when compared to predicted toxicity (R2=0.943, P&amp;lt0.0001). When assessing the in vitro toxicity of unknown (blind) contaminated soil samples, the Hazard Index (HI) predicted from the chemical analyses results showed a relatively good correlation (R2&amp;gt0.7062, n=26) when compared to the experimental toxicity results on HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the comparison of Australian Health Investigation Levels (HIL) with in vitro toxicity testing gave similar correlation (R2&amp;gt0.6882, n=26) on HepG2 cells. The overall project suggests the potential application of the zwitterionic surfactant (CHAPS) in sampling contaminants from soils in an in vitro toxicity assessment. This study demonstrates the application of in vitro toxicity assessment using human cells for the prediction of toxic risk as a sentinel to human toxicity from a contaminated site.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicity testing - In vitro</field><field name="subject">Soil pollution</field><field name="subject">Human cell culture - Effect of chemicals on</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doped quantum antiferromagnets</field><field name="creator">L??scher, Andreas, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we study the effects of doping in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets. We consider cases where the undoped parent compound is a Mott insulator with long-range antiferromagnetic order and focus on the low-doping situations.  The limit of localized impurities is studied in a system consisting of a host magnet and two additional weakly coupled spins. We derive the effective Hamiltonian describing the interaction between these impurities as a function of their distance and show that it exhibits xyz anisotropy, leading to NMR and EPR line broadening. We calculate the  magnetization disturbance in the host magnet induced by a single impurity and find that it always enhances Neel order.  Relaxing the localization constraint, we investigate the single-hole dynamics of the t-J model on the honeycomb lattice. Using exact diagonalizations, series expansion and the self-consistent Born approximation, we calculate the quasi-particle dispersion, bandwidth and residues and compare our findings with the well-established results for the square lattice. Similar to the latter case, we find an almost flat band along the edges of the magnetic Brillouin zone and well-defined hole pockets around the corners.  The most important part of this thesis is devoted to the magnetic properties of lightly doped La2-xSrxCuO4, the simplest and by far most studied cuprate superconductor. Starting from the undoped parent compound, we calculate the spin-wave spectrum and the spin-flop transitions in a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. We then consider the low-doping regime and derive the effective field theory describing the spin dynamics in insulating La2-xSrxCuO4, x &#8804; 0.055, at low temperature. The spin structure resulting from the spiral solution of the extended t-J model, obtained by taking into account the Coulomb trapping of holes by Sr ions, is confined in the copper-oxide planes. Our solution explains why the incommensurate structure is directed along the orthorhombic b axis and allows us to calculate the positions and shapes of the neutron scattering peaks numerically. These results are in perfect agreement with experimental data. We also show that topological defects (spin vortex-antivortex pairs) are an intrinsic property of the spin-glass ground state.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copper oxide superconductors.</field><field name="subject">High temperature superconductivity.</field><field name="subject">Antiferromagnetism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular regulation of Megakaryopoiesis: the role of Fli-1 and IFI16</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Lacey Nicole, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Megakaryocytes (Mks) are unique bone marrow cells, which produce platelets. Dysregulated Mk development can lead to abnormal platelet number and the production of functionally defective platelets, causing bleeding, thrombotic events, and leukaemia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving megakaryopoiesis may yield insights into the molecular genetics and cellular pathophysiology of a diversity of disorders. The primary aim of this thesis was to gain insight into the molecular events required for normal Mk development. As transcription factors and cytokines play a central role in driving Mk development, both of these processes were investigated. Fli-1 and GATA-1 are key transcription factors regulating Mk-gene expression, alone and co-operatively. To understand the mechanism of transcriptional synergy exerted by Fli-1 and GATA-1, in vitro assays were carried out investigating the interactions between Fli-1, GATA-1 and DNA that mediate synergy. A novel mechanism of synergy was identified, where Fli-1 DNA binding is not required, although an interaction between Fli-1 and GATA-1, and GATA-1 DNA binding is required. Importantly, the results demonstrate that Fli-1 DNA binding is not essential for promoting Mk-gene expression in primary murine bone marrow cells. Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary cytokine responsible for Mk and platelet development. Identifying novel TPO gene-targets may provide invaluable information to aid the understanding of the complex and unique processes required for Mk development. Using microarray technology, IFI16 was identified as a TPO-responsive gene that has not previously been studied in the Mk lineage. This work demonstrated that IFI16 is expressed in CD34+ HSC-derived Mks, and that the Jak/STAT pathway is essential for the activation of IFI16 by both TPO and IFN-??. Of biological significance, IFI16 was found to regulate both the proliferation and differentiation of primary Mks, suggesting that IFI16 may control the balance between these two essential processes. In conclusion, the data in this thesis presents a novel mechanism through which Fli-1 and GATA-1 regulate the synergistic activation of Mk genes. The identification and functional characterisation of a novel TPO-inducible gene, IFI16, involved in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of Mks is also described. These findings have implications for several congenital and malignant conditions affecting Mk and platelet development, and possibly a mechanism for IFN-induced thrombocytopaenia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes</field><field name="subject">Fli-1</field><field name="subject">GATA-1</field><field name="subject">IFI16</field><field name="subject">Thrombopoietin</field><field name="subject">Interferon</field><field name="subject">Blood cells</field><field name="subject">Blood platelets</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of coal ash and process conditions on coal/char reactivity for PCI into BF</field><field name="creator">Al-Omari, Yaser, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The combustion efficiency of pulverised coal injection PCI is an important factor influencing stability and productivity of the blast furnace. It is affected by coal properties and the process conditions employed for combustion. Economic considerations have driven blast furnace operators to commission a wide range of coals, which differ in type and rank. The main objective of the current project is to study the influence of different operating conditions on combustion performance of coal and to examine the role of coal minerals and their transformations on low and high temperature reactivity. The combustion performance of three PCI coals was investigated under a range of combustion conditions including three combustion temperatures of 900??C, 1200??C and 1500??C, and a range of oxygen concentrations in the gas phase at 1200??C in a drop tube furnace (DTF). The low temperature oxygen reactivity of pyrolysed chars was also measured by observing weight loss in a thermogravimetric (TGA) furnace at 600??C. Physical and chemical properties of pyrolysed and partially combusted chars were characterised using a range of analytical tools including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, BET N2 surface area and Hg porosity. The correlation between char properties and char reactivity at low and high temperatures was also investigated. All three coal samples experienced deactivation during progressive combustion at 1200??C and 23%v O2 i.e. there was a decrease in the reaction rate with proceeding combustion. The carbon structure of the chars became increasingly ordered as quantified by an increase in crystallite height and a decrease in the amorphous carbon proportion in char. Partially combusted char had much higher surface area than a pyrolysed one, which can be attributed to the opening of enormous number of closed pores as combustion proceeds. However, this increase in surface area did not show a direct correlation with char reactivity. Average particle size of ash increased with increasing degree of combustion due to fusion and agglomeration of coal minerals. Under these conditions, carbon structural ordering of char was found to be one of the key factors primarily responsible for loss of char reactivity during combustion. Increasing oxygen content in the gas stream from 23% to 35% at 1200??C resulted in a significant improvement in the combustion performance of three coals, with burnout increasing from ~65% to up more than ~95%. However, increasing oxygen level beyond 35% did not lead to any further significant improvements. Coal burnout was also enhanced by increasing temperature in the range 900??C to 1500??C, such that the improvement was much more rapid in the higher temperature range of 1200??C to 1500??C. This could be related to increased reaction rates at higher temperatures. Pyrolysed char reactivity was measured at low temperature 600??C and 10%v O2 using TGA. The results indicated that the presence of iron and calcium minerals could result in enhanced char reactivity. Coal minerals underwent increased fusion and melting as the combustion temperature was increased. At 1500??C, most ash particles were molten. The level of basic oxides in ash as well as the extent of association between aluminosilicates and basic oxides enhanced the proportion of molten phases. Fusing and melting behaviour of ash particles was found to influence char combustion reactivity at high temperatures. Ash melting on the char surface may hinder gas accessibility to the reactive surface of char, thereby decreasing char burnout. The molten ash particles may coalesce and cover char surface or these molten particles may partially/completely block char pores. The amount of slag phases in ash and the distribution of minerals in char are expected to have a significant influence on ash-char interactions at high temperatures. In summary, the study shows that inorganic matter present in coal can affect coal combustion in a number of ways. Inorganic minerals, such as iron and calcium catalyse char oxidation at low temperatures. On the other hand, these minerals may act as fluxing agents at high temperatures, which could lower the melting point of aluminosilicates minerals in char. The molten phases of ash may restrict the accessibility of oxygen to carbon in char through physical obstruction, thereby, retard char oxidation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental and theoretical investigation for the machining of hardened alloy steels</field><field name="creator">Lee, Tae-Hong, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research work in this thesis involves an experimental and theoretical investigation for high speed machining of AISI 4140 medium carbon steels and AISI D2 tool steels which are classified as being difficult to machine materials. An experimental program was carried out to determine the cutting forces, chip formation, the secondary deformation zone thickness and surface roughness at different cutting speeds using a 0.4mm and 0.8mm nose radii ceramic tools and -7?? rake angle for annealed (virgin) AISI 4140 and heat treated AISI 4140 steel. Another series of experiments was carried out on the annealed (virgin) and heat treated AISI D2 with 0.4mm, 0.8mm and 1.2mm nose radii CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) tools under various cutting conditions.  A theoretical model is developed by taking into account the flow stress properties of the AISI 4140 (0.44% carbon content) to use with the Oxley Machining approach. To find the flow stress data for AISI D2 tool steel, the Johnson and Cook empirical constitutive equation is used as the constitutive model. In addition, the magnitude of tool radius should be also considered to determine the prediction of cutting performances. To account for the effect of nose radius edge in hard machining, a simplified geometrical method is used to model the parameters for application in the Oxley Model and works for the cutting conditions considered here. These extensions to the Oxley machining theory were verified by experimental results. These results show a good agreement between the Oxley machining theory and hard machining experiment at data. The research work described in this thesis provides useful data for hard machining conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Metallurgy.</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiplexed optical fibre sensors for civil engineering applications</field><field name="creator">Childs, Paul, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fibre-optic sensors have been the focus of a lot of research, but their associated high cost has stifled their transferral from the laboratory to real world applications. This thesis addresses the issue of multiplexing, a technology that would lower the cost per unit sensor of a sensor system dramatically.  An overview of the current state of research of, and the principles behind, multiplexed sensor networks is given. A new scheme of multiplexing, designated W*DM, is developed and implemented for a fibre Bragg grating (FBG) optical fibre sensor network. Using harmonic analysis, multiplexing is performed in the domain dual to that of the wavelength domain of a sensor. This scheme for multiplexing is compatible with the most commonly used existing schemes of WDM and TDM and thus offers an expansion over, and a resultant cost decrease from, the sensor systems currently in use.  This research covered a theoretical development of the scheme, a proof of principle, simulated and experimental analysis of the performance of the multiplexed system, investigation into sensor design requirements and related issues, fabrication of the sensors according to the requirements of the scheme and the successful multiplexing of eight devices (thus offering an eightfold increase over current network capacities) using this scheme.  Extensions of this scheme to other fibre sensors such as Long Period Gratings (LPGs) and blazed gratings were also investigated. Two LPGs having a moir?? structure were successfully multiplexed and it was shown that a blazed Fabry Perot grating could be used as a tuneable dual strain/refractive index sensor. In performing these tests, it was discovered that moir?? LPGs exhibited a unique thermal switching behaviour, hereto unseen.  Finally the application of fibre sensors to the civil engineering field was investigated. The skill of embedding optical fibre in concrete was painstakingly developed and the thermal properties of concrete were investigated using these sensors. Field tests for the structural health monitoring of a road bridge made from a novel concrete material were performed. The phenomenon of shrinkage, creep and cracking in concrete was investigated showing the potential for optical fibre sensors to be used as a viable research tool for the civil engineer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical fibre sensors.</field><field name="subject">Wavelength-frequency multiplexing.</field><field name="subject">W*DM.</field><field name="subject">FBGs.</field><field name="subject">Moir??

Such a technique is indispensable in the seismic analysis of large-scale engineering constructions and, to my best knowledge, does not exist at present. The theoretical framework of the research is based on the scaled boundary finite-element method. The following advances are achieved:  The scaled boundary finite-element method is extended to simulate the dynamic response of non-homogeneous unbounded domains. The scaled boundary finite element equations in the frequency and time domains are derived for power-type non-homogeneity frequently employed in geotechnical engineering. A high-frequency asymptotic expansion of the dynamic-stiffness matrix is developed. The frequency domain analysis is performed by integrating the scaled boundary finite-element equation in dynamic stiffness. In the time domain, the scaled boundary finite-element equation including convolution integrals is solved for the unit-impulse response at discrete time stations.  A Pad?? series solution for the scaled boundary finite-element equation in dynamic stiffness is developed. It converges over the whole frequency range as the order of the approximation increases. The computationally expensive task of numerically integrating the scaled boundary finite-element equation is circumvented.  Exploiting the sparsity of the coefficientmatrices in the scaled boundary finite-element equation leads to a significant reduction in computer time and memory requirements for solving large-scale problems. Furthermore, lumped coefficient matrices are obtained by adopting the auss-Lobatto-Legendre shape functions with nodal quadrature, which avoids the eigenvalue problem in determining the asymptotic expansion.  A high-order local transmitting boundary constructed from a continued-fraction solution of the dynamic-stiffness matrix is developed. An equation of motion as occurring in standard structural dynamics with symmetric and frequency-independent coefficient matrices is obtained. This transmitting boundary condition can be coupled seamlessly with standard finite elements. Transient responses are evaluated by using a standard timeintegration scheme. The expensive task of evaluating convolution integrals is circumvented.  The advances developed in this thesis are applicable in other disciplines of engineering and science to the analysis of scalar and vector waves in unbounded media.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil-structure interaction.</field><field name="subject">Soil structure -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Finite element method.</field><field name="subject">Boundary element methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultivated tastes colonial art, nature and landscape in the Netherlands Indies</field><field name="creator">Protschky, Susanne, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">Culitivated Tastes argues for a new evaluation of colonial landscape art and representations of nature from the Netherlands Indies (colonial Indonesia). The thesis focuses on examples from Java, Sumatra, Ambon and Bali during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but also discusses early post-colonial literature. It uses paintings and photography, with supporting references to Dutch colonial novels, to argue that images of landscape and nature were linked to the formation of Dutch colonial identities and, more generally, to the politics of colonial expansion. Paintings were not simply colonial kitsch (mooi Indi??, or 'beautiful Indies', images): they were the purest expression of Dutch ideals about the peaceful, prosperous landscapes that were crucial to uncontested colonial rule. Often these ideals were contradicted by historical reality. Indeed, paintings rarely showed Dutch interventions in Indies landscapes, particularly those that were met with resistance and rebellion. Colonial photographs often supported the painterly ideals of peace and prosperity, but in different ways: photographs celebrated European intrusions upon and restructuring of Indonesian landscapes, communicating the notions of progress and rational, benevolent rule. It is in literature that we find broader discussions of nature, which includes climate as well as topography. Here representations of landscape and nature are explicitly linked to the formation of colonial identities. Dutch anxieties about the boundaries of racial and gender identities were embedded within references to Indies landscape and nature. Inner colonial worlds intersected with perceptions of the larger environment in literature: here the ideals and triumphs associated with Dutch colonial expansion were juxtaposed against fears related to remaining European in a tropical Asian landscape.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art, Colonial -- Indonesia.</field><field name="subject">Cultural landscapes -- Indonesia -- History.</field><field name="subject">Landscape painting, Dutch.</field><field name="subject">Landscape painting -- Indonesia.</field><field name="subject">Colonies in art.</field><field name="subject">Colonies in literature.</field><field name="subject">Imperialism in art.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volatile sulfur compounds in coastal acid sulfate soils, northern N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Kinsela, Andrew Stephen, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cycling of biogenic volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) within marine and terrestrial ecosystems has been shown to play an integral role in atmospheric chemistry; by influencing global climate change through the creation of cloud condensation nuclei and controlling acid-base chemistry; as well as influencing sediment chemistry including the interactions with trace metals, particularly regarding iron sulfide formation. Despite this, the examination of VSCs within Australian coastal acid sulfate soils (ASS) is an unexplored area of research. As ASS in Australia occupy an area in excess of 9 M ha, there is a clear need for a greater understanding of the cycling of these compounds within such systems.  This thesis looks at the concentrations of several VSCs within agricultural and undisturbed ASS on the east coast of Australia. Initial measurements of sulfur dioxide (SO2) were made using passive diffusion samplers, which were followed by two detailed field-based studies looking at the concentrations and fluxes of both SO2 and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) using flux-gradient micrometeorological techniques. These novel results indicated that this agricultural ASS was a substantial source of atmospheric H2S (0.036-0.056 gSm-2yr-1), and SO2 (0.095-0.31 gSm-2yr-1), with flux values equating to many other salt- and freshwater marshes and swamps. The flux data also suggested that the ASS could be a continual source of H2S which is photo-oxidised during the daytime to SO2. Measurements of both compounds showed separate, inverse correlations to temperature and moisture meteorological parameters indicating possible contributing and / or causal release factors. Further identification of these and other VSCs within ASS samplers was undertaken in the laboratory using gas chromatography in combination with solid-phase microextraction. Although SO2 and H2S were not discovered within the headspace samples, two other VSCs important in atmospheric sulfur cycling and trace metal geochemistry were quantified; dimethylsulfide (DMS; &amp;gt 300??g/L) and ethanethiol (ESH &amp;gt 4??g/L).  The measurements of H2S, DMS and ESH are the first quantifications with Australian ASS, and they may be important for refining regional or local atmospheric sulfur budgets, as well as interpreting previous SO2 emissions from ASS. Ultimately this thesis further enhances our understanding of the cycling of VSCs within acid sulfate systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphur compounds -- Environmental aspects -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Sulphur dioxide -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen sulphide -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Soil acidity -- Australia -- North Coast (N.S.W.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro characterisation of the hepatitis C virus genotype 3a RNA dependent RNA polymerase</field><field name="creator">Clancy, Leighton Edward, Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication is directed by NS5b, the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). To date, our understanding of the HCV polymerase has come almost entirely from genotype 1. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of sequence variation in the polymerase region by characterising a polymerase derived from genotype 3a.  The genotype 3a CB strain polymerase was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pTrcHis2C incorporating a hexahistidine tag to facilitate purification. An optimised process produced 2.5 mg of highly purified recombinant protein per litre of bacterial culture. The 3a preparation possessed an RdRp activity and could utilise both homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNA templates. Optimal activity was seen at 30oC at pH 8 in reactions containing 160nM enzyme, 10??g/ml RNA template and 2.5mM MnCl2. Subsequently, three genotype 1b polymerases including the HCV-A, Con1 and JK1 strains were cloned for the comparison of activity under identical conditions. Steady state kinetic parameters for GMP incorporation revealed the 3a polymerase exhibited the highest activity, with an almost two fold higher catalytic efficiency (Kcat/Km) than HCVA-1b, primarily due to differences in Km for GTP (2.984??M vs 5.134??M). Furthermore, the 3a polymerase was 3.5 fold and 15 fold more active than JK1-1b and Con1-1b respectively. Improving our understanding of the influence of sequence difference on polymerase activity, particularly in the context of replication will be crucial to developing effective antiviral therapies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HCV.</field><field name="subject">NS5b.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="subject">RNA polymerases.</field><field name="subject">Viruses -- Reproduction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-purpose multi-way data analysis</field><field name="creator">Ebrahimi Mohammadi, Diako, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, application of multi-way analysis is extended into new areas of environmental chemistry, microbiology, electrochemistry and organometallic chemistry.

In this work while the applicability of traditional ANOVA is restricted due to the high interaction amongst the factors, GEMANOVA is shown to return robust and easily interpretable models which conform to the actual structure of the data.  Peptide-modified electrochemical sensors are used to determine three metal cations of Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ simultaneously. Two sets of experiments are performed using a four-electrode system returning a three-way array of size (sample ?? current ?? electrode) and a single electrode resulting in a two-way data set of size (sample ?? current).

In the first experiment, central corneal thickness (CCT, ultrasonic pachymetry), IOP (Goldmann tonometry) and corneal curvature (keratometry) was measured in one eye of 25 subjects every two hours for 24 hours, except for 8 hours overnight (no measurements taken), and for the first two hours after awakening (measurement frequency 20 minutes). CCT (+20.1??10.9 pm) and IOP (+3.1??2.4 mmHg) peaked on eye opening, and then decreased at a similar rate (r=0.967, p&lt;0.001) for the next two hours. Corneal swelling may have influenced the accuracy of Goldmann IOP measurements during this time. In the second and third studies, the CCT, IOP and corneal curvature were measured in both eyes of two groups of 25 subjects before and after the induction of corneal swelling, resulting from two hours of monocular closed eye contact lens wear. The increase in IOP was correlated to the increase in CCT at a rate of 0.33 to 0.48 mmHg per 10 pm, which signified an overestimation error in Goldmann IOP measurement. However, the change in IOP could not be accounted for solely by the change in CCT. In the fourth study, CCT, IOP and corneal curvature were used in conjunction with the Orssengo-Pye algorithm to determine the range of Young's modulus in the normal population, which was 0.29??0.06 MPa. Physiological variations in Young's modulus had a similar effect on Goldmann tonometry to CCT. In the fifth study, the data collected for studies 2 and 3 was used to calculate the Young's modulus changes associated with corneal swelling, again with the assistance of the Orssengo-Pye algorithm. No systematic change in Young's modulus was recorded after contact lens wear, but the model suggested that corneal biomechanical changes were responsible for the remainder of the change in IOP. All experimental results were combined to develop a model to calculate the diurnal variation of Goldmann IOP errors. The likely error in IOP due to overnight corneal swelling was 0.6 to 1.4 mmHg, which may explain as much as 45% (1.4 mmHg) of the 3.1 mmHg diurnal variation of IOP. In summary, small amounts of corneal swelling were shown to have a clinically significant impact on the accuracy of Goldmann tonometry. This may interfere with the measurement of the diurnal variation of IOP, particularly if measurements are taken prior to the resolution of overnight corneal swelling.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cornea -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Tonometry</field><field name="subject">Intraocular pressure -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogeochemical dynamics of an intermittently open estuary: a field and modelling study.</field><field name="creator">Everett, Jason D., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science., UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a combined modelling and observational study of an intermittently open and closed lake or lagoon (ICOLL) in south-eastern Australia. ICOLLs are a common, yet vulnerable type of estuary characterised by low freshwater inflow leading to a sand berm being formed across the entrance preventing oceanic flushing. The accumulation of nutrients during the closed phase, and the increased water residence time, can have detrimental effects on the estuary if the nutrient load cannot be assimilated. The general aim of this study was to develop a quantitative understanding of ecological processes in Intermittently Closed and Open Lakes or Lagoons (ICOLLs) through a combination of field work and ecological modelling. The field-based component of the studied was completed in Smiths Lake, NSW Australia. The field data shows that concentrations of NH3, NOx and Chlorophyll a in Smiths Lake gradually increases over time between the two studied opening events, before declining while the lake is open to the ocean. Phosphorus concentration is relatively low throughout both cycles. Of the 2 opening events, one was long (~ 3.5 months) and one was short (~3 weeks). Initially ammonia concentrations following this short open period were 2-4 times higher than the initial values from the previous 2 closures. The reduced open phase also resulted in more persistent stratification. The observations show that the duration of the open/closed phases will influence the physiochemical characteristics of the water column. A spatially resolved, eleven-box ecological model was developed for Smiths Lake. The process descriptions in the ecological model are based on a combination of physical and physiological limits to the processes of nutrient uptake, light capture by phytoplankton and predator/prey interactions. An inverse model is used to calculate mixing coefficients from salinity observations. When compared to field data, the ecological model obtains fits for salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a and zooplankton that are within 1.5 standard deviations of the mean of the field data. Simulations show that nutrient limitation (nitrogen and phosphorus) is the dominant factor limiting growth of the autotrophs during both the open and closed phases of the lake. The model is characterised by strong oscillations in  phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance,typical of predator-prey cycles. A sensitivity analysis was completed using a simplified 1-box configuration, coupled with the existing ecological model. When small perturbations in the initial conditions of DIN, phytoplankton and zooplankton are implemented, the standard deviations of the state variables strongly attract to a declining oscillation, showing the variation between runs decreasing with time. The most sensitive parameters in the model were the feeding efficiency of small and large zooplankton, and the mortality of epiphytes and small zooplankton which all had normalised sensitivities of 1.28, 1.11, 1.01 and 1.05 respectively for a 10% change in parameter value. The non-linearity of the model is illustrated by increasing the percentage change of the parameter. For a 25% change in feeding efficiency of small and large zooplankton, the normalised sensitivity increased to 1.28 and 1.15 respectively, and for a 50% change, they increased further to 1.78 and 1.35 respectively. The ecological state variables were also sensitive to increased catchment loads and depths. The modelled system switches from seagrass dominated to algal dominated at loads over 10?? the current loads, with increased plankton biomass and suspended solids shading the seagrass. The spatially resolved ecological model is run for a variety of open/closed cycles to assess the impact of various opening regimes on the model state variables. The results indicate that Smiths Lake is capable of assimilating its current nutrient loads without persistent phytoplankton blooms or a decrease in seagrass biomass. When catchment loads are increased by 10?? or the duration of the lake open/closed cycle is increased there is a corresponding increase in seagrass biomass. In contrast, small and large phytoplankton both increase in biomass as the duration of the open phase increases. Small and large phytoplankton growth is generally limited by phosphorus, and seagrass growth is limited by nitrogen under normal catchment loads. Due to the shallow depths and low phytoplankton biomass, seagrass only becomes light limited when the nutrient and suspended solids loads are increased 10??. This switch to light limitation only decreases the biomass for short periods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine ecology.</field><field name="subject">Lakes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution equations and vector-valued Lp spaces: Strichartz estimates and symmetric diffusion semigroups.</field><field name="creator">Taggart, Robert James, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The results of this thesis are motivated by the investigation of abstract Cauchy problems. Our primary contribution is encapsulated in two new theorems.  The first main theorem is a generalisation of a result of E. M. Stein. In particular, we show that every symmetric diffusion semigroup acting on a complex-valued Lebesgue space has a tensor product extension to a UMD-valued Lebesgue space that can be continued analytically to sectors of the complex plane. Moreover, this analytic continuation exhibits pointwise convergence almost everywhere. Both conclusions hold provided that the UMD space satisfies a geometric condition that is weak enough to include many classical spaces. The theorem is proved by showing that every symmetric diffusion semigroup is dominated by a positive symmetric diffusion semigoup. This allows us to obtain (a) the existence of the semigroup's tensor extension, (b) a vector-valued version of the Hopf--Dunford--Schwartz ergodic theorem and (c) an holomorphic functional calculus for the extension's generator. The ergodic theorem is used to prove a vector-valued version of a maximal theorem by Stein, which, when combined with the functional calculus, proves the pointwise convergence theorem.  The second part of the thesis proves the existence of abstract Strichartz estimates for any evolution family of operators that satisfies an abstract energy and dispersive estimate. Some of these Strichartz estimates were already announced, without proof, by M. Keel and T. Tao. Those estimates which are not included in their result are new, and are an abstract extension of inhomogeneous estimates recently obtained by D. Foschi. When applied to physical problems, our abstract estimates give new inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates for the wave equation, extend the range of inhomogeneous estimates obtained by M. Nakamura and T. Ozawa for a class of Klein--Gordon equations, and recover the inhomogeneous estimates for the Schr??dinger equation obtained independently by Foschi and M. Vilela.

There is limited information about the form of minerals in the metallurgical cokes and no information about their relative concentration. A comprehensive study was undertaken for characterisation of mineral matter in coke (qualitative and quantitative), which enabled quantification of the effect of catalytic minerals on the reaction rate, and establishment of the effect of gasification on the mineral phases. Also, the relative importance of coke properties on the gasification reaction rate was determined. The reactivity experiments were performed at approximately 900??C using 100% CO2 under chemically controlled conditions. The mineralogical composition of the investigated cokes was found to vary greatly as did the levels of catalytic mineral phases. These were identified to be metallic iron, iron sulfides and iron oxides. The gasification reaction rate at the initial stages was strongly influenced by the content of catalytic mineral phases and also by the particle size of the catalytic mineral matter. The reaction rate increased as the contact surface between catalyst and carbon matrix increased.  Catalytic mineral phases showed a strong influence on the reaction rate at early stages of reaction. But their influence diminished during gasification. At later stages of reaction the influence of micropore surface area became more important.  The influence of the catalytic mineral phases diminished during gasification because the catalyst was inactivated to some degree and the contact surface between the catalyst and carbon matrix diminished due to the strong gasification of the carbon around the catalyst particles. The partial inactivation of the catalytic mineral phases occurred because metallic iron and pyrrhotite were oxidised by CO2 to iron oxide, and in turn iron oxide reacted with other mineral phases, which it is associated with, to form minerals that are not catalysts. It is noteworthy that a significant percentage of the mineral matter present in the investigated cokes was amorphous (44 - 75%). The iron, potassium and sodium present in the amorphous phase did not appear to catalyse gasification, but their potential contribution to gasification could not be completely excluded.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metallurgical coke.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Coal gasification.</field><field name="subject">Carbon dioxide.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomic dysreflexia following high level spinal cord injury: time course, mechanisms and possible intervention.</field><field name="creator">Laird, Angela S, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Following cervical or upper thoracic level spinal cord injury (SCI), motor, sensory and autonomic systems are disrupted. One form of this autonomic dysfunction is the condition autonomic dysreflexia (AD), which is characterised by episodes of high blood pressure in response to afferent input from regions below the injury level. An animal model of autonomic dysreflexia, the T4 transected rat, was used in this thesis to gain insight into the cardiovascular and temperature components of the disorder, possible peripheral mechanisms and interventions to prevent its development. Chapter 2 of the thesis includes the charaterisation of a T4 transection rat model of spinal cord injury. This characterisation includes confirmation of decreased baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP, 71 down from 117 mmHg) and elevated heart rate (HR, 431 bpm from 366 bpm) for 6 weeks post injury (p.i.). Documentation of the development of AD found that hypertensive responses were fully developed (+20 mmHg) by 4 weeks p.i. Further, during episodes of AD at Weeks 4 and 5 p.i., tail surface temperatures decreased significantly (mid-tail, -1.7oC), indicative of extensive vasoconstriction. Comparison of vascular responses of intact and SCI animals to adrenergic agonists (phenylephrine, PHE and methoxamine, METH) following ganglionic blockade in vivo found that SCI animals experienced prolonged vasoconstriction in blood vessels above and below injury level in response to PHE but not METH. Possible mechanisms of this change included decreased neuronal reuptake of PHE (METH is not a substrate for neuronal reuptake). The presence of prolonged vasoconstriction in blood vessels throughout the body, not just regions below injury level, suggests a widespread mechanism for the change, such as the decreased basal MAP, norepinephrine levels or neural activity present following injury. Thus, it was hypothesised that increased activity from an early stage post injury may prevent the peripheral adaptation and perhaps hinder development of AD. For this, the common rehabilitation technique, treadmill training, was used. Surprisingly, rather than preventing AD, the training actually accelerated its development, producing exaggerated hypertensive responses to colorectal distension (CRD) at Weeks 3 and 4 post-injury (Week 4, Trained: +38.5 ?? 1.5 mmHg; Sedentary: 23.4 ?? 3.1mmHg). Comparison of vascular responses of both groups to PHE injection found no significant difference indicating that the enhanced responses were not a result of peripheral vascular changes. Investigation of the central morphology following SCI, made via immunohistochemical processing of the post-mortem spinal cords, found that Treadmill Trained SCI animals had elevated calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity within lamina III/IV of lumbar segments, compared to intact cords. It is possible that this finding indicates afferent sprouting that may have accelerated the development of AD in Treadmill Trained animals. The results within this thesis highlight the importance of awareness and examination of autonomic function in SCI patients, especially those undergoing rehabilitative training.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spinal cord.</field><field name="subject">Injuries.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Macromolecular fouling during membrane filtration of complex fluids</field><field name="creator">Ye, Yun, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Macromolecular components, including protein and polysaccharides, are viewed as one type of major foulants in the complex feed membrane filtration systems such as membrane bioreactor (MBR). In this thesis, the mechanisms of macromolecular fouling including protein and polysaccharide in the complex feed solution are explored by using Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and alginate as model solution. During the filtration of BSA and washed yeast with 0.22 ????m PVDF membrane, it was found that the critical flux of mixture solution was controlled by washed yeast concentration while the existence of BSA significantly changed the cake reversibility of much larger particles. The fouling mechanisms of alginate, as a model polysaccharide solution, were investigated both in dead end and crossflow membrane filtration. In the dead end experiments, it was found that the cake model appears to fit the entire range of the ultrafiltration data while the consecutive standard pore blocking model and cake model are more applicable to microfiltration membranes. The alginate was featured with high specific cake resistance and low compressibility despite some variations between different membranes. The specific cake resistance ( c ) is similar to c of BSA and actual extracellular polymer substance (EPS) in MBR systems reported in the literature, and higher than that of many colloidal particles. In a system contained alginate-particles mixture, it was found that the existence of alginate dramatically increased the cake specific resistance and decreased the cake compressibility. The fouling mechanism of alginate was also studied using long term cross flow filtration under subcritical flux. A two-stage TMP profile similar to that typically observed in MBR was obtained, confirming the important role of EPS during membrane fouling in MBR. In addition to adsorption, trace deposition of alginate also contributed to the initial slow TMP increase during the subcritical filtration. TMP increase during the long-term filtration was found not only due to the increase of the amount of deposition, but also the increase of specific cake resistance. A combined standard pore blocking and cake filtration model, using a critical pore size for the transition time determination, was developed and fit the experimental results well.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="subject">Membrane reactors</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="subject">Membrane filters</field><field name="subject">Membrane separation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33245</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fragile X mental retardation and fragile X chromosomes in the Indonesian population</field><field name="creator">Hussein, Sultana Muhammad, School of Pathology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Indonesian archipelago comprises more than 17,000 islands, inhabited by ~200 million people constituting more than 350 recognizable ethnic and tribal groups which can be classified into two broad ethno-linguistic groups [the Austronesian (AN) and non-Austronesian (NAN) speaking peoples] and 3 physical anthropology groups (Deutero Malay, Proto Malay and Papuan).  The origins of these groups are of considerable anthropological interest. The anthropology of Indonesia is extremely complex and still controversial. The present populations of Indonesia show very great diversity. The data presented below result from an investigation of the Fragile X A syndrome and the size and distribution of alleles at fragile sites on the X chromosome among Javanese males with developmental disability (DD) and unselected males from 10 major Indonesian ethnic groups.	The Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat array in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR-1 gene at Xq27.3. Normal X chromosomes have between 6-54 CGG trinucleotide repeats, whereas premutation alleles have 55-230 and full mutation alleles more than 230 repeats.  In a study of predominantly Caucasian males with intellectual disability, the prevalence of Fragile X syndrome is estimated to be approximately 1:4,000.  FRAXE mental retardation syndrome is caused by an expansion of a GCC trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of FMR2 gene located 600 kb telomeric to FMR1. The prevalence of FMR2 is 1-2 per 100,000 live births. FMR2 common alleles consist of 11-30 GGC repeats; intermediate alleles between 31-60 GCC repeats; premutation alleles with 61-200 repeats and full mutation alleles have over 200 repeats with attendant methylation of the repeat array	The first Indonesian screening program aimed at determining the presence and prevalence of fragile XA syndrome among individuals with mild DD (IQ above 50) from special schools (N=205) and isolated areas (N=50) of Java was undertaken in 1994-1996 by cytogenetic and molecular studies. In this first study 4 fragile X positive children were found among 255 males with DD. The estimated prevalence of fragile-X in males with mild DD from special schools was 1.95% (5/205) and the overall prevalence was 1.57% (4/255).	The number of trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated regions of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes were determined by PCR in 254 Fragile XA-negative Javanese male children with DD. The distribution of FMR1 and FMR2 trinucleotide repeat alleles was found to be significantly different in the Indonesian population with DD compared to that in equivalent Caucasian populations. The trimodal distribution of Indonesian FMR1 alleles (29, 30 and 36 repeats) is largely in agreement with findings from other Asian populations).  This provides supportive evidence that the origin of Indonesians could be the same as that of the Chinese and Japanese. 	Sequence analysis was performed on the trinucleotide repeat arrays of the 27 individuals' FMR1 alleles in the 'grey zone' (35-52 repeats). The identification of 16 unrelated individuals with a (CGG)36 allele that also contains a (CGG)6 segment [(CGG)9AGG(CGG)9AGG(CGG)6 AGG(CGG)9 or 9A9A6A9 pattern] is in agreement with earlier observations in the Japanese population.  It is proposed that this FMR1 array pattern may be specific for Asian populations and that Javanese and Japanese populations may have arisen from a single progenitor population. The presence of pure 25, 33 and 34 CGGs in FMR1 alleles with 36, 44 and 45 repeats respectively, suggests that these may represent alleles at high risk for instability and may therefore be at early stages of expansion to a premutation. The lack of the characteristic (CGG)6 in all three alleles with ?? 25 pure CGG arrays suggests that the most common Asian 36 repeat allele is not predisposed to slippage expansion. Seven of the 8 alleles with 36 CGG repeats could be sequenced.  Seven of 36 CGG repeats FMR1 alleles from the Hiri population has been sequenced and 4 alleles indicated 9A9A6A9 pattern, 1 sample with 10A25 pattern  Two of the remaining alleles showed 12A6A6A9 structure, which consisted of a tandem duplication of the (CGG)6 segment.  The presence of a tandem duplication of (CGG)6 segments has never been reported in any other population.	The other major findings of this study are that FRAXE syndrome is a rare cause of developmental disability in this predominantly-Javanese population.  The most common FMR2 (GCC)20 allele in this selected Asian population is significantly longer than that previously reported for Caucasian populations.  There was a weak correlation between the overall length of the FMR1 and FMR2 repeat arrays within the normal range (Spearman's Rank Correlation = 0.130, p-value=0.042) in the Indonesian population, which have been no previous associations reported for alleles within the normal range. 	One approach to studying the origins of the human populations is to study the genetic structure of polymorphic alleles such as those at the FMR1 locus and its linked microsatellite markers DXS548 and FRAXAC1.  Length polymorphisms of the FMR1 gene (CGG)n repeat array, DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were studied in a total of 1,008 unselected males from 10 different Indonesian ethnic groups.  FMR1 alleles were identified ranging from 8 to 57 CGG repeats. The most common CGG repeat allele was 29 (45.6%) followed by 30 (27.4%) and 36 repeats (8.0%). One hundred and forty four grey zone (3-52 CGG) alleles were found in the study population.  Four people of the same ethnic group from an isolated island in Eastern Indonesia (Hiri, Ternate), a representative of the NAN ethnolinguistic group, had CGG repeat lengths of 55-57.  The prevalence of these alleles is estimated to be 3.3% (4/120) in the population of Hiri or 0.4% (4/1008) of whole Indonesian population.	Thirteen different alleles were found at the DXS548 locus, of which allele numbers 7 [194 bp] (44.1%), 6.5 [195bp] (43.5%) and 6 [196bp] (7.5%) are the most common.  Seven rare alleles, some of which have not been previously found in Asian peoples were also identified (190, 191,192, 193, 197,198, 199, 202, 204 and 206) and accounted for 3.9% of the total.  The odd number alleles were dominantly found in this study whereas almost none found in Caucasian. The finding of many "odd numbered" alleles DXS548 has never been found in other Asian population and has only been documented extremely rarely in Caucasians and Africans.	Five different alleles of FRAXAC1 identified with alleles D [106 bp] (62.2%) and C [108bp] (35.6%) accounting for 97.8% of FRAXAC1 alleles in the population.  Three rare alleles (104, 110, 112 bp = 2.2%) were identified that have not been previously found in other Asian populations (1-3).  There is a striking linkage disequilibrium of FMR1 alleles with FRAXAC1 (p=0.0001), 88% of 29 (CGG)n repeats alleles associated with FRAXAC1 allele D (106bp) versus only 17% with the 30 (CGG)n repeat alleles, which is in agreement with other studies.  The value of D' was calculated to be 0.7.	The longer alleles of both DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were found mostly in the NAN ethnolinguistic group. Moreover the Irian Jaya people also showed a higher percentage of people with 30 CGG repeats and the 108 bp FRAXAC1.  The Eastern Indonesian NAN groups demonstrate a different genetic background probably due to the contribution of Melanesian peoples.	The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) identified that the vast majority of genetic diversity occurs within, rather than between, ethnic groups.  These data are consistent with a model where there is sufficient migration (~20 per generation) between populations to minimise differentiation of population through genetic drift. The results obtained are consistent with three clusters of populations that share similar allele frequencies at the fragile X locus.  The most clearly defined cluster is based in the east of Indonesia and includes the two Irian populations, Minahasans and Hiri. A surprising finding was that the Minahasan who are Deutero-Malay in origin and physical appearance are genetically closer to the Irianese.  This may reflect the admixture of Melanesian alleles or other eastern Indonesian alleles as a result of their geographic location in that part of Indonesia.	The second major cluster is largely based in the west of the country and is composed of the following Deutero-Malay populations; Javanese, Balinese, Acehnese but which also includes people from Ternate (not including those from Hiri).  Using Delta Mu and Nei's genetic distance for FMR1 locus in this study the Javanese were shown to have the closest distance to Balinese which is consistent with anthropological data and with published data.	The third group is a "western and central" group composed of Bimanese, Dayak and Sundanese who share some features of the western and eastern clusters but mostly resemble the western Indonesian populations. Bima is located in the lesser Sunda in between west Indonesia and east Indonesia. The Bimanese are of mixed Deutero &amp; Proto Malay origin that is consistent with their geographic location.	The Bataks are distinctive and sit somewhat apart in this scheme. In this study, Bataks were found not to resemble the other Proto-Malay group studied (the Dayak).  The Dayaks were found to have fewer alleles than the Bataks at FRAXAC1 and DXS548.  In all four methods of calculating genetic distance Bataks showed a large genetic distance to almost all other ethnic groups.	There are differences in allele frequency between east and west Indonesia as well as other Asian nations, but the genetic similarities between these groups are also very impressive.  The findings from this study are consistent with other genetic anthropological evidence that the people of Indonesia have the same origin as North-east Asian groups.  This model is referred to as the "express train from Taiwan" in which the Austronesian speakers are proposed to have radiated from Taiwan bringing the Malayo-Polynesian language group to the Philippines, Borneo and Sulawesi around 5000-4500 B.P.E. However Richards et al.(1998) have used the diversity in the mtDNA D Loop to propose an alternative to the "express train" model.  The "two train7quot; model proposes that the Austronesian languages originated within eastern Indonesia during the Pleistocene era and spread through Melanesia and into the remote Pacific within the past 6,000 years.  Unfortunately the high migration rates between population groups that were demonstrated in this thesis and the known migration patterns of populations through Indonesia preclude determining whether the observed allelic heterogeneity is a function of the original population or due to the admixture of several gene pools in more recent times.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">X linked mental retardation</field><field name="subject">Fragile X syndrome</field><field name="subject">Mental retardation Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of human cytomegalovirus susceptibility to novel antiviral agents</field><field name="creator">Jun, Min, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant infectious agent causing disease in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients, transplant recipients, and neonates.  The current antiviral therapeutic strategy against CMV is limited in its utility due to the inherent toxicity and lack of bioavailability of currently available anti-CMV agents, ganciclovir (GCV), cidofovir (CDV), and foscarnet (FOS). The development of the prodrug of GCV, valganciclovir (val-GCV), has vastly improved the bioavailability profile of GCV. However, val-GCV demonstrates limited effectiveness against tissue-invasive CMV diseases as side effects involved with traditional intravenously administered GCV such as haematologic and reproductive toxicities remain. In addition, the emergence of antiviral resistant CMV mutant strains due to prolonged treatment with currently available antivirals necessitates the development of novel anti-CMV agents with reduced toxicity and improved bioavailability. In this study, select groups of novel compounds were analysed for their potential for further development as anti-CMV agents. Three groups of compounds were identified based on two screening methods which included the computer simulated screening process of compounds known as in silico screening and the traditional method of random screening. The first group of compounds (CATi) were identified by in silico screening against the CMV DNA polymerase catalytic aspartate triad, resulting in the identification of 31 compounds with the potential for inhibitory activity against CMV. The second group of compounds (PRO-i) were identified through in silico screening against the CMV protease, identifying a total of 18 lead compounds exhibiting structural complementarity with CMV protease. The third and final group of compounds (TPEX) were identified through random screening and consisted of plant extracts purified from tropical plants. All three compounds were initially screened for cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts. Plaque reduction assays were performed using compounds with acceptable levels of cytotoxicity to determine the ability of the compounds to inhibit the replication of the laboratory antiviral sensitive CMV strain, Towne. Two of the PRO-i compounds demonstrated good antiviral activity against CMV. Eleven percent (2/18) of the PRO-i compounds inhibited CMV replication, with PRO-i-43 and PRO-i??-44 displaying mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 4.8 ?? 1.2 ??M and 8.04 ??M, respectively. PRO-i-43 and PRO-i-44 are thus good candidates for further development as novel antiviral agents against CMV. The majority of CATi and TPEX compounds displayed significant cytotoxicity against human fibroblasts and compounds with acceptable levels of cytotoxicities did not significantly inhibit CMV replication. However, the identification of compounds with low cytotoxicities provides a good foundation for further development of novel anti-CMV agents with superior antiviral activity. In silico screening against three-dimensional viral protein models is a useful strategy for the identification of novel antiviral agents with the potential for inhibitory activity against CMV. Structural modification to produce potent derivatives of the identified anti-CMV compounds (PRO-i-43 and PRO-i-44) is a good option for the further development of novel antiviral agents against CMV. Such further examination of the identified compounds with anti-CMV activity is required to investigate their activity against not only antiviral sensitive CMV strains but also resistant CMV strains. Further investigations will yield new insights into their target, allowing further identification of compounds with potential anti-CMV activity with pharmaceutical application.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plaque reduction assay</field><field name="subject">In silico screening</field><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses</field><field name="subject">Human cytomegalovirus</field><field name="subject">Antivirals</field><field name="subject">Antiviral agents</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular expression analyses of mice treated with antipsychotic drugs</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Carlotta, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Schizophrenia is a devastating psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population. The main treatments for schizophrenia are antipsychotic drugs that target dopamine receptors, yet the underlying biological mechanisms through which they alleviate the symptoms of schizophrenia remain ill defined. In this study, we used microarray analysis to profile the expression changes of thousands of genes simultaneously, following antipsychotic drug treatment of mice. Mice were treated chronically (28 days), or for a novel intermediate time-point (7 days), with one of three antipsychotic drugs: clozapine, haloperidol or olanzapine. The use of three drugs enabled us to discern antipsychotic-specific effects co-regulated by multiple drugs, rather than the side effects of individual compounds. Transcript profiling and validation by quantitative PCR of whole brain tissue revealed antipsychotic drug regulation of genes in diverse biological pathways, including: dopamine metabolism, neuropeptide and second-messenger signalling, neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, cell adhesion, myelination, and voltage-gated ion channels. The regulation of voltage-gated channels by antipsychotic drugs has been suggested previously by electrophysiological studies, although thorough analysis has not been undertaken in vivo. Therefore, the second aim of this study was to characterise the regional mRNA and protein expression of two genes altered by multiple APDs, the voltage-gated potassium channel ??-subunit (Kcna1) and voltage-gated potassium channel interacting protein (Kchip3). Regional characterisation and expression analyses were carried out by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation, and Western blot analysis of mouse brain regions of interest to schizophrenia and its treatment. Following 7-day haloperidol treatment we observed up-regulation of Kcna1 in the striatum and dentate gyrus, with increased protein in the striatum, hippocampus and midbrain; and down-regulation of Kchip3 in the striatum, with decreased protein in the cortex, hippocampus and midbrain. These studies implicate voltage-gated potassium channels in the antipsychotic drug regulation of midbrain dopaminergic neuronal activity, adult neurogenesis and/or striatothalamic GABAergic neuronal inhibition. These findings indicate that regulation of potassium channels may underlie some of the mechanisms of action of antipsychotic drugs, and that voltage-gated ion channels may provide alternative drug targets for the treatment of schizophrenia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mouse brain</field><field name="subject">Antipsychotic drugs</field><field name="subject">Microarray analysis</field><field name="subject">Potassium channels</field><field name="subject">Mice as laboratory animals</field><field name="subject">Molecular genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of exercise-based lifestyle interventions on cardiovascular reactivity of untrained premenopausal women</field><field name="creator">Park, Young Jin, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Three studies were designed to investigate the effects of exercise-based lifestyle interventions including diet change and exercise training on cardiovascular and autonomic responses to various physical and mental challenges in untrained premenopausal women. In Study 1, the effects of different tasks designed to activate the sympathetic nervous system on autonomic control of cardiovascular functioning such as the Stroop colour-word task (Stroop) and lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in 20 untrained premenopausal women (22.6??0.7 years) were determined. In Study 2, a longitudinal exercise intervention strategy was used with 18 untrained premenopausal women (22.5??0.7 years) in order to investigate the effect of 15 weeks of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) training on cardiac autonomic responses to mental challenge (Stroop) and LBNP. In Study 3, the effects of HIIE training combined with a Mediterranean-style eating plan and fish oil supplement (Fish oil, Exercise, Mediterranean diet; FEM) on cardiovascular function during mental challenge (Stroop) and physical tasks (handgrip and reactive hyperaemia) were examined in 32 overweight untrained premenopausal women (22.0??0.6 years).                     In these studies, forearm blood flow (FBF) was assessed using Hokanson Plethysmography with the venous occlusion technique. The surface electrocardiogram and continuous beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure were also monitored. Peak oxygen uptake was assessed using open-circuit spirometry (True Max 2400, ParvoMedics). In addition, body composition was measured using DEXA (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry; DPX-IQ, Lunar Radiation).	Results from Study 1 indicate that FBF response to mental challenge in young females was smaller compared to previously obtained data from age-matched males. Furthermore, this FBF response to mental challenge was negatively correlated to insulin resistance estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) (r = - .52, p &lt; .05). In addition, when cardiopulmonary baroreceptors were unloaded by a mild level of LBNP (-20 mmHg) during Stoop, FBF response to mental challenge (vasodilation) was abolished suggesting a large dependency of vasodilation response during mental challenge on cardiopulmonary baroreflex.	After 15 weeks of supervised HIIE training, aerobic fitness improved (p &lt; .05) whereas percent of body fat was significantly decreased (p &lt; .05). In addition, recovery BP following Stroop was significantly reduced. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was marginally decreased (p = .056).  Women who had higher insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) lost less fat than women with lower HOMA-IR (r = .60, p = .088). In addition, change in FBF during Stroop after training was directly related to pretest insulin resistance levels (r = .68, p &lt; .05). Therefore, HIIE training had a normalising effect on FBF response to mental challenge. PEP/LVET ratio at rest and during LBNP was also significantly increased in women with higher HOMA-IR suggesting a reduction in cardiac contractility via a decrease in sympathetic stimulation (r = .62, p = .076, r = .62, p = .75 respectively). 	In Study 3 results indicated that 12 weeks of the FEM trial significantly reduced percent of body fat (p &lt; .001), fasting insulin (p &lt; .05), interleukin-6 (p &lt; .05) and cortisol (p  &lt; .05), and significantly improved aerobic fitness ( ; p &lt; .001). With respect to cardiovascular and cardiac autonomic measures, rate pressure product (RPP) was significantly reduced at rest (p &lt; .05) and during recovery after Stoop (p &lt; .05), suggesting decreased myocardial oxygen consumption. In addition, baseline heart rate determined in the sitting position was significantly reduced (p &lt; .05), while both baseline high frequency power (HF) determined in supine (p &lt; .01) and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) determined in the sitting position (p &lt; .05) were increased after the FEM trial. In addition, BRS determined during mental challenge also marginally increased (p = .051).	In summary, lifestyle intervention including HIIE training, Mediterranean-style eating plan, and a fish oil supplement significantly enhanced parasympathetic influence of the heart and improved fitness, blood profiles, and body composition.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical and mental challenges</field><field name="subject">Exercise-based lifestyle interventions</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular and autonomic response</field><field name="subject">Lifestyles</field><field name="subject">Perimenopause</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differentiation of human embryonic stem cells for the treatment of type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Lees, Justin Guy, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">A five stage selection protocol originally applied to mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) was examined for the derivation of insulin producing cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Insulin gene expression was observed and insulin protein was measured by radioimmunoassay. However, the radioimmunoassay results were shown to be susceptible to false positive findings due to the presence of exogenous insulin within differentiation media and it was concluded that this particular strategy was not ideal for the derivation of insulin producing cells from hESCs. An investigation was then undertaken regarding the in vivo differentiation of cells derived from hESCs seeded within 3D scaffolds to determine if this would result in the derivation of insulin producing cells. Within scaffolds there were abundant cells which stained positively for ectoderm lineage markers including nestin. Cells which stained positively for markers of endothelial progenitors representing the mesoderm lineage were also observed and rare cells stained for endoderm markers including insulin. These investigations also demonstrated that transplanting scaffolds seeded with cells derived from hESCs between the liver lobules of immunodeficient mice could lead to the formation of teratomas. Factors that may have influence the formation of teratomas were further investigated and it was demonstrated that teratoma formation was inhibited by altering in vitro treatment of cells. An in vitro investigation was then performed to determine the extracellular matrix (ECM) producing capacity of hESCs and differentiated cells derived from hESCs because ECM proteins are required for the formation of 3D structures similar to pancreatic islets. The results from this investigation indicated that differentiated cells produced multiple ECM proteins at substantially higher levels than hESCs. The ECM producing differentiated cells could be useful in the development of surrogate islet like tissue by supplying a suitable ECM structure within a 3D scaffold environment to aid the function of ??-cell surrogates. Furthermore, these differentiated cells derived from hESCs were shown to produce an adhesive basement membrane in vitro, which is derived from human sources, and could be utilized in the derivation, propagation and differentiation of hESCs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Stem cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epi-CHO, an episomal expression system for recombinant protein production in CHO cells</field><field name="creator">Kunaparaju, Raj Kumar, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current project is to develop a transient expression system for Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells based on autonomous replication and retention of plasmid DNA.

The CHO-K1 cell line expressing PyLT-Ag, named CHO-T was adapted to suspension growth in serum-free media (EXCELL-302) to facilitate large scale transient transfection and recombinant (r) protein production. PyLT-Ag-expressed in CHO-T supported replication of PyOri-containing plasmids and enhanced growth and r- protein production. A scalable cationic lipid based transfection was optimised for CHO-T cells using LipofectAMINE-2000??.

There are numerous methods and techniques that could be employed to achieve the purpose of designing energy efficient buildings. The Thesis explores the viability of double-skin fa??ades (DSF) to provide natural ventilation as an energy efficient solution for office buildings in hot and humid environment by using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations and case study methodologies.  CFD simulations were used to examine various types of DSF used in office buildings and the behaviour of airflow and thermal transfer through the DSF; the internal thermal comfort levels of each office spaces were analyzed and compared; and an optimization methodology was developed to explore the best DSF configuration to be used in high-rise office buildings in the tropics. The correlation between the fa??ade configurations, the thermal comfort parameters, and the internal office space energy consumption through the DSF is studied and presented.  The research outcome of the Thesis has found that significant energy saving is possible if natural ventilation strategies could be exploited with the use of DSF. A prototype DSF configuration which will be best suited for the tropical environment in terms of its energy efficiency through cross ventilation strategy is proposed in this Thesis. A series of comprehensive and user-friendly nomograms for design optimization in selecting the most appropriate double-skin fa??ade configurations with considerations of various orientations for the use in high-rise office buildings in the tropics were also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Office building.</field><field name="subject">Natural ventilation.</field><field name="subject">Double-skin facade.</field><field name="subject">Computational fluid dynamic.</field><field name="subject">Hot and humid climate.</field><field name="subject">Ventilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tansnational Care Space Zentraleuropa.

The procedure is applied to one research topic in Library and Information Science, Bradford's Law of Scattering.  An analysis is made of the underlying concepts, viz. 'document', 'selection', 'collection comprehensiveness', 'topic', 'research topic', and 'on' and 'relevant to' a research topic.  An important distinction is drawn between graphical and semantic attributes of documents, and between their modes of analysis.  The central problem of the study is that, while 'topic' is a problematic semantic attribute of documents, a well-defined collection of documents requires a selection criterion formulated on unproblematic graphical attributes.  The solution proposed is to let specialist A&amp;I Services legitimate a research topic and to provide a sample of its documents; then to extract a diagnostic graphical pattern from the sample, and from this construct a criterion which can be mechanically applied to all documents.  Modifications introduced into the general procedure include the iterative development of the criterion from the growing collection, and allowing a content analysis of documents to suggest diagnostic patterns in the text.  The graphical selection criterion developed for the specific collection was composed of six alternative pairs of word-stems separated by at most two words in the body of the text of documents.  It has an estimated precision of 96% against the background literature and retrieves 90% of all known documents which might be judged to be on the topic.  The final collection consists of 1187 analytical-level and scholarly documents written in 19 languages; it is well-defined, accords with convention, and is judged to be near completion for documents more strongly on and influential in the topic.  Inadequacies in the procedure and in the collection formed were examined and improvements have been suggested.  For example, the mixing of semantic and graphical methods in the pattern extraction process is clarified, recall can be enhanced by the addition of several small sub-collections, and measures of topic aboutness and topic influence were installed in the collection.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bibliometrics</field><field name="subject">Bradford's Law of Scattering</field><field name="subject">collection formation</field><field name="subject">subject literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eutrophication and excessive Macroalgal growth in Lake Macquarie, New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, David John, School of Biological Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In response to concern that excessive macroalgal growth and accumulation was occurring in some inshore areas of Lake Macquarie, the distribution, abundance and seasonality of macroalgae was investigated in relation to nutrient input and power station cooling water. Macroalgal dry weight biomass was measured at ten sites on a monthly basis for two years, with an analysis of community structure conducted using Multi-Dimensional Scaling. The macroalgal community in Lake Macquarie was typical of those found in other New South Wales coastal lagoons, exhibiting considerable spatial and temporal variation. A close similarity was observed in macroalgal community structure at sites affected by urban nutrient input, these being characterised by a high biomass often attributable to only one or two species. These nuisance macroalgae were mostly green algae, which were almost entirely absent from other sites. Biomass at sites affected by urban nutrient input was generally within the range documented for eutrophic estuaries elsewhere. Analysis of macroalgal community structure showed no evidence of large-scale changes macroalgal communities attributable to the effects of power station cooling water except within 500m of the outfall. At sites affected by a 1-2??C temperature increase, community structure and the magnitude of the biomass were similar to sites deemed as being relatively free of human impact. A reduction in species diversity occurred only within the immediate discharge zone, where water temperatures were approximately 6??C above ambient temperatures. Excessive growth of nuisance macroalgal species was not observed at any of the sites influenced by power station cooling water. There were no distinct patterns in seasonality of macroalgal growth in this study, though the greatest biomass appeared to occur in spring. The irregular temporal variation in macroalgal growth suggests that the most significant factors affecting growth occur on a time scale of weeks to months. It is therefore likely nutrient input to the nearshore  through surface runoff is an important influence on the distribution and abundance of macroalgae in Lake Macquarie. This emphasises the need to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus input from urban sources in Lake management.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eutrophication</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Lake Macquarie</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Macroalgae</field><field name="subject">Lake Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The collapse of dialogue:Intellectuals and politics in the Uruguayan crisis, 1960-1973</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Stephen William George, Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the context of the growing political instability and deepening economic crisis in Uruguay during the 1960s and early 1970s, the thesis examines two propositions. The first is that politically informed intellectuals, though disaffected or marginalised, will integrate themselves into the political mainstream if circumstances demand and a suitable vehicle allows them to participate usefully in the political process. The second is that, in the Uruguayan case, an expanded notion of dialogue is essential in analysing how this was accomplished, partly because the idea of dialogue was a necessary part of how they worked together and communicated with their public, and partly because dialogue was seen as a crucial element in reforming the nation and as the basis of the relationship between the political party that was to be the agent of such reform and its potential constituency. The thesis begins by examining how the so-called 1945 and 1960s generations overcame intergenerational squabbles and worked together, with the help of an expanding publishing industry, to create a public for their meditations on Uruguay's problems. Then, after briefly outlining the importance of dialogue to the essay as a genre and its role in developing national identity in Latin America, the study examines essays on the state of Uruguay by four major writers in the 1960s: Roberto Ares Pons, Alberto Methol Ferr??, Carlos Maggi and Washington Lockhart. The thesis then traces the intelligentsia's role in the several attempts to heal the rifts within the Uruguayan left and in the formation of the centre left coalition, the Frente Amplio, in 1971, to show how the notion of dialogue was incorporated into its structure, mode of operation and political program. The final section, a case study of Mario Benedetti's political activities and propagandist essays of 1971-1973, examines the contradictions of working as a committed intellectual when the very conditions necessary for intellectual life are breaking down. The thesis concludes that the resurrection of the nation as a site for dialogue with and among all members of society, a project in which the intelligentsia had enthusiastically participated, foundered because drastic political polarisation permitted only one militarist and monologic solution.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uruguay</field><field name="subject">intellectuals</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">1960-1973</field><field name="subject">Frente Amplio</field><field name="subject">Mario Benedetti</field><field name="subject">Carlos Maggi</field><field name="subject">Carlos Maggi</field><field name="subject">Albert Methol Ferre</field><field name="subject">Roberto Ares Pons</field><field name="subject">Washington Lockhart</field><field name="subject">publishing industry</field><field name="subject">Liber Seregni</field><field name="subject">essays</field><field name="subject">manifestos</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An enquiry into new methodologies for evaluating sustainable urban form</field><field name="creator">Osmond, Paul William Hughes, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a perceived gap in knowledge regarding the complex relationships between the physical form of the urban environment; its environmental performance as expressed through stocks and flows of materials and energy (urban metabolism); and its experienced physical and psychological qualities (urban ambience). The objective is to develop a practical methodological structure which, through investigating the relationships between these domains, may help inform the evaluation, design and development of more sustainable human settlements. One expression of this apparent knowledge gap is the ambiguity around the classification of urban form and identification of a suitable taxonomic framework to support analysis. Urban morphological research and practice is critically reviewed to derive a rigorous definition of the 'urban structural unit' (USU) to facilitate the subdivision and description of urban form across spatial scales. Application of this construct to a study site in Sydney, Australia provides the basis for subsequent exploration. Investigation of theoretical and applied perspectives on urban ecology, metabolism and design enables distillation of a utilitarian set of structural, functional and ambience properties of the USU. A variety of quantitative methods pertinent to evaluation of these properties is systematically examined to derive a streamlined analytical methodology, integrating hemispherical image analysis, space syntax, isovist and material accounting methods within the USU framework. The efficacy of this methodological 'toolkit' is tested in the final, empirical stage of the research, focussing mainly on the campus of the University of New South Wales. Determination of a range of material, microclimatic, ecosystemic, fractal, syntactic and isovist metrics provides a preliminary quantitative description of the campus USU in terms of its interrelated metabolic and ambience properties. This is further explained and interpreted through multivariate statistical analysis. The results suggest that the USU represents a robust framework for urban evaluation, and application of a relatively parsimonious suite of analytical methods enables a useful initial examination of the relations between significant aspects of urban form, metabolism and ambience. The outcomes of such an evaluation can directly inform built environment practice from a sustainability perspective, and also highlight areas for more detailed investigation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urban metabolism</field><field name="subject">Urban sustainability</field><field name="subject">Urban morphology</field><field name="subject">Urban ambience</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42119</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty, gender &amp; community development: The lived experiences of slum-dwelling women in Nairobi</field><field name="creator">Muli, Chrisanta Kanini, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores poverty and community development in the slums of Nairobi. It theorises on the nature of slum-dwelling women's lived experiences of poverty within a patriarchal society, and highlights not only their lack of financial capacity to address household needs, but also their lack of capabilities in terms of social and economic rights. The study provides identification and analysis of the significant role that slum-dwelling women play in community development initiatives. It proposes that these women??s individual and collective experiences of poverty, within Kenyan patriarchal society, are the fundamental motivation for them to engage in community development within their communities.  Critical concepts and theories driving the study are poverty, gender and community development, contextualised within the Kenyan state and society. A qualitative methodology was used, employing a participatory action research framework. A number of qualitative methods were applied: focus groups, semi-structured in-depth individual interviews, and documentary analysis. Women from three women??s groups based in Nairobi slums participated and were co-researchers. Guided by the ??voices?? of slum-dwelling women, this thesis changed its original orientation concerning the use of information technology to an exploration of slum-dwelling women??s lived experiences of poverty. It is argued that these experiences catapulted the women into ??home-grown?? community development initiatives. Their lack of 'access' to fundamental resources and services is attributed, in large part, to the neo-colonial and patriarchal nature of Kenyan society that has perpetuated and compounded gender biases and inequality. This study identifies a disconnection between formal definitions of poverty and any resulting ??imposed?? community development initiatives, and the women??s analyses of their own priorities and needs. The women??s multi-level and intersectorial understanding of poverty, and their ??home-grown?? community development initiatives offer a finely contextualised, responsive and capacity-building alternative approach to addressing the reality of their poverty. This thesis proposes that for slum-dwelling women in Nairobi to benefit from community development, such development must be based upon their contextualised, class- and gender-framed definitions of poverty. This can be understood as the next generation of community development that is neither imposed nor externally managed, but emerges from the people, in this case the women in the slums of Nairobi who are experiencing the poverty. This emerging community development is generated from and by the women??s analyses of the disconnection, corruption and failure of current development approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vestibular evoked potentials:  Properties and clinical applications of extraocular reflexes.</field><field name="creator">Rosengren, Sally Marie, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vestibular-dependent surface potentials can be recorded from over the scalp following stimulation with intense air- (AC) and bone-conducted (BC) sound.  However, sound-evoked responses may be confounded by parallel stimulation of the auditory system.  To demonstrate the pure vestibular origin of the cortical potentials, patients with severe to profound bilateral hearing loss were stimulated with AC and BC sound.  The responses had the same amplitude as those recorded in normal subjects, and were only present in patients with preserved vestibular function, confirming their vestibular origin. One negative surface potential, the N15, was largest when measured over the forehead, and detailed mapping of this potential localised it to the eyes.  This extraocular response had the same polarity on each side of the eye and was altered by changing gaze direction, suggesting an extraocular muscle origin (i.e. an ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential, or OVEMP).  Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) produces large eye movements with horizontal and torsional components directed away from the cathode.  A modified electrode montage was used to characterise the OVEMPs produced by GVS.  OVEMPs recorded from beneath the eyes had the appropriate polarity to produce the torsional eye movement and likely originated in the inferior oblique muscles.  Sound-evoked OVEMPs were investigated in patients with superior canal dehiscence (SCD), as they have vestibular hypersensitivity to sound.  The SCD patients had large sound-evoked OVEMPs with low threshold, similar to the VEMP.  OVEMP amplitude was much larger in the patients than controls and could be an additional diagnostic marker for this condition. Although SCD patients have large VEMPs and eye movements evoked by AC sound, little is known about other vestibular reflexes.  It was shown that patients also have large sound-evoked vestibulo-spinal reflexes, similar to those evoked by GVS.  However, despite these large reflexes, there was little consistent whole body sway.  Finally, a case is reported in which the combination of VEMP and OVEMP results indicated the location and nature of a central nervous system lesion.  The patient had delayed potentials when stimulated on the left side, indicating a demyelinating lesion in the root entry zone of the left vestibulocochlear nerve.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VEMP</field><field name="subject">vestibular</field><field name="subject">VOR</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social justice after Kant: Between constructivism and deconstruction (Rawls, Habermas, Levinas, Derrida)</field><field name="creator">Bankovsky, Miriam Ann, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relation between two contrasting approaches to justice: the constructive and reconstructive projects of Rawls and Habermas on the one hand, and the deconstructive projects of Levinas and Derrida on the other. First, I identify the central difference between the two projects, reconstructing each account of justice as it develops in relation to Kant??s practical philosophy. I then argue that the two projects are complementary.               [New Paragraph]               Whilst Rawls and Habermas emphasise the possibility of objectively realising Kant??s idea of an impartial standpoint among autonomous persons, Levinas and Derrida defend the impossibility of determining the content of justice. Rawls and Habermas subscribe to the ??art of the possible??, rendering Kant??s impartial standpoint by means of the ??original position?? (Rawls) or the ??procedures of discourse ethics?? (Habermas). By contrast, Levinas argues for justice??s failure, discovering, in Kant??s moral law, a principle of responsibility for the particular other which conflicts with impartiality. Distinguishing himself from both the reconstructive tradition and Levinas, Derrida affirms, in part through his readings of Kant, the ??undecidability?? of the critical function of justice. Committed to the possibility of justice, Derrida also acknowledges its impossibility: no local determination can reconcile responsibility before the other with impartiality among all.               [New Paragraph]               Having identified the central difference between the two traditions, I then defend their complementarity. ??Reasonable faith?? in the possibility of justice must be supplemented by the acknowledgment of its impossibility. Conversely, attesting to justice??s failure is unsatisfactory without commitment to the possibility of constructing just social forms. Distancing myself from the liberal critique whereby deconstruction withdraws from the political (Fraser, McCarthy, Benhabib, Gutmann), I instead add my voice to a dissenting group (Young, Cornell, Mouffe, Honig, Honneth, Patton, Thomassen) which affirms that deconstruction can productively engage with the constructive tradition.

The project involved: ?? studying the sorption of U on model minerals (Georgia kaolinite and ferrihydrite) in laboratory experiments ?? carrying out experimental studies of U sorption on complex natural substrates ?? studying the mechanisms influencing U retardation in the natural environment, including transformation processes of iron oxides ?? identifying chemical factors which control U sorption on model and natural substrates ?? developing a mechanistic model for U sorption on ferrihydrite and kaolinite using the surface complexation adsorption model , and ?? assessing and modelling the effect of complexing ligands on uranyl adsorption.  Uranium (VI) sorption on geological materials is influenced by a large number of factors including: pH, ionic strength, partial pressure of CO2, adsorbent loading, total amount of U present, and the presence of inorganic and organic ligands. The sorption of UO22+ typically increases with increasing pH (the 'low pH sorption edge') up to about pH 7. In systems equilibrated with air, there is a sharp decrease in sorption above this pH value (the 'high pH edge'), due to strong complexation between uranyl and carbonate. The adsorption model being used for ferrihydrite is a surface complexation model with a diffuse double layer, and both strong and weak sites for U sorption. Based on the analysis of EXAFS data, the U surface complexes were modelled as mononuclear bidentate surface complexes of the form (&amp;gtFeO2)UO20. Ternary surface complexes involving carbonate with the form (&amp;gtFeO2)UO2CO32- were also required for the best simulation of U sorption data. There was a slight decrease in U sorption on ferrihydrite in systems that contained sulfate. It was necessary to consider competition between UO22+ and SO42- for surface sites, as well as complexation between UO22+ and SO42- to model the data. The presence of citrate considerably reduced U sorption and caused dissolution of ferrihydrite. Complexation of citrate with both uranyl and ferric ions was taken into account in modelling this system. The model required the optimisation of the formation constant for a postulated mixed metal (U/Fe/citrate) aqueous complex. Humic acid increased U uptake at pH values below 7, with little effect at higher pH values.	In terms of the amount of U sorbed per gram of adsorbent, U uptake on kaolinites KGa-1 and KGa-1B was much weaker than U uptake on ferrihydrite under similar experimental conditions. Electron microscope examination showed that titanium-rich impurity phases played a major role in the sorption of U by these standard kaolinites. A relatively simple model for uranyl sorption on the model kaolinites was able to account for U sorption under a wide range of experimental conditions. The model involved only three surface reactions on two sites (&amp;gtTiOH and &amp;gtAlOH), with a non-electrostatic surface complexation model. The relative amounts of the sites were estimated from AEM results. Precipitation was taken into account in modelling the experimental data obtained with high U concentrations. The effects of sulfate and citrate on U sorption by kaolinite were also assessed and modelled. Sulfate had a small effect on U sorption, which may be explained by aqueous complexation. Citrate had a greater effect, and this was not wholly explained by the formation of aqueous U-citrate complexes. The most likely explanation would also involve competition for surface sites between U and citrate. Uranyl uptake on ferrihydrite was greatly increased by the presence of phosphate. This was not due to precipitation, and was attributed to the formation of a ternary surface complex with a proposed structure of (&amp;gtFeO2)UO2PO43-. The log K value for the formation of this complex was optimised using FITEQL. Phosphate also increased uptake of uranyl on kaolinite, and this was also attributed to the formation of ternary uranyl phosphate surface species. Uranium sorption on weathered schist samples from the vicinity of the Koongarra U deposit in northern Australia was generally similar to the model minerals (in terms of the effects of pH, ionic strength, total U, etc). Many experiments with the natural materials were spiked with an artificial U isotope (236U), which allowed adsorption (of 236U) and desorption (of 238U) to be distinguished, and provided a means of estimating the 'labile' or 'accessible' portion of the natural U content. A significant advantage of this method is that (unlike chemical extractions) it does not rely on the assumptions about the phases extracted by 'selective' reagents. Uranium sorption experiments were also carried out with Koongarra samples which had been treated with citrate / dithionite / bicarbonate (CDB) reagent to remove iron oxides. Uranium sorption was greatly decreased by the CDB extraction, which reduced the surface area of the samples by about 30-40%. To further elucidate the impact of iron minerals on U mobility in the natural environment, the transformation of synthetic ferrihydrite containing adsorbed natural uranium was studied. In these experiments, the ferrihydrite was partially converted to crystalline forms such as hematite and goethite. The uptake of an artificial uranium isotope (236U) and the leaching of 238U from the samples were then studied in adsorption / desorption experiments. The transformation of ferrihydrite to crystalline minerals substantially reduced the ability of the samples to adsorb 236U from solution. Some of the previously adsorbed 238U was irreversibly incorporated within the mineral structure during the transformation process. Therefore, transformation of iron minerals from amorphous to crystalline forms provides a possible mechanism for uranium immobilisation in the groundwater environment. In considering the overall effect on U migration, this must be balanced against the reduced ability of the transformed iron oxide to adsorb U. The experiments with the model and natural substrates demonstrated that trace impurities (such as Ti-oxides) and mineral coatings (such as ferrihydrite) can play a dominant role in U adsorption in both environmental and model systems. Although the various substrates had different affinities for adsorbing U, the effects of chemical factors, including pH, ionic strength, and carbonate complexation were similar for the different materials. This suggests that a mechanistic model for U sorption on model minerals may eventually be incorporated in geochemical transport models, and used to describe U sorption in the natural environment.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uranium Absorption and adsorption</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women, sport and ethnicity: exploring experiences of difference in netball</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Tracy Lynn, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how sports organisations and discourses have impacted on the sports participation of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in Australia.  A series of national participation studies have documented that women from minority ethnic backgrounds have significantly lower participation rates in sports and physical activity than Anglo-Australian women.  However, the explanations and dimensions of this difference have not been examined in previous research.  The experiences of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are used in this thesis to explore sports discourses and organisation and the embodiments of their interrelationship.  The present research proposes that sports organisations and discourses within Australia have historically served to marginalise women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.  The arguments for this position are explored using a local narrative which details the situated nature of women????s experiences of sports.  These experiences are located within a historical context that traces migration policies, the growth and development of sports and women????s social relations since white settlement of Australia.  It is argued that contemporary sports discourses and organisation are inextricably tied to Australia????s colonial and imperialist past.  Theories of ethnicity, gender and sports are analysed.  The theoretical perspective taken in this thesis builds on feminist ideologies and ethnicity studies.  Empirical analysis is undertaken using gender relations to situate sport as a site of cultural struggles best understood through investigations of history and diversity.  Aspects of power, control and influence are central to this thesis.  The empirical component of this thesis uses secondary data sources, surveys and interviews to investigate the research proposition.  This is achieved on two levels.  The first level interrogates existing data to create a macro level analysis of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in sports.  A survey of 972 schoolgirls was undertaken to collect information on sports participation and attitudes to sports.  This was followed by 30 interviews with women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds that explored individual sports experiences and perspectives on sports.  The second level of investigation employed the case study of netball to examine the research question as it related to a specific sports organisation.  The case study component of the research involved document and archival analysis, a survey of 372 netball players and interviews with 18 women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and former and current netball administrators.  The thesis analyses the empirical data as it relates to the organisation and discourse of sports in Australia.   The principal conclusion reached is that sports organisation and discourses are located within a societal power structure that places women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds on its margins.  Sports participation is predicated on conformity to existing cultural practices and expectations and it does little to facilitate cultural diversity.  The women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who participated in the research did not perceive sports as particularly inclusive of gender and culture.  The examination of netball demonstrated that netball has not been concerned with ????other???? women, rather it has focussed its efforts on appealing to ????mainstream???? women.  While netball has not explicitly excluded the involvement of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, neither has it actively encouraged cultural diversity.  This thesis makes a contribution to knowledge in the field of sports studies with its empirical research and through the ensuing development of a framework for locating the implications of inclusion or exclusion in sports organisations and discourses. This understanding can be used to assess and inform future sports policy development and practice.  Principally, the thesis seeks to acknowledge and legitimise the sports experiences of women from diverse backgrounds and in doing so provides insights into a better theoretical understanding about the nexus of gender, ethnicity and sports.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Netball Australia</field><field name="subject">Sports for women Australia</field><field name="subject">Minorities in sports Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Australian perspective on talent development in music: The influence of environmental catalysts upon the provision of opportunities for learning, training and practice in the musical domain</field><field name="creator">Chadwick, Felicia, School of Education Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study explored the influence of environmental catalysts, upon the provision of field specific opportunities for learning, training, and practice, for a sample population of musically involved young Australians. The findings enhance understandings of the conditions in which children's musical aptitudes are developed. Research bases in the fields of gifted education and music education were employed to support the investigation. Components of Gagn??'s Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (1995a) provided the theoretical framework for this investigation. Two survey questionnaires, completed by Australian parents (N = 194 and N = 182 respectively), sought information pertaining to the subject child's musical involvements and undertakings. Some details of the musical interests and involvements of the child's parents and siblings were also obtained. Quantitative and qualitative data contribute to an extensive profile of the types of music programs and provisions which support the normative and expert development of Australian children's musical behaviours.  Parents' musical interests and involvements appear to have strongly influenced the choice of home-based recreational pursuits for their children. The convincingly articulated, positive, field specific views espoused by Australian parents appear to have been translated into the provision of multiple, simultaneous opportunities for their children to engage with musical undertakings. Notable amongst the data are the structured involvements of young musicians with music composition engagements. The data also indicate that many of the sample of Australian children received high levels of support and encouragement for musical undertakings from parents who were themselves musically interested and knowledgeable. Parental involvements with their children's music lesson and practice related engagements, were found to be characterised by features of deliberate practice.  The home-based environments of young Australian musicians were found to be characterised by opportunities for exposure to rigorous and challenging musical engagements, undertaken at an optimally early age, thereby enhancing normative musical development. Such engagements provided the necessary foundation for expert levels of musical skill acquisition. An ascending progression of musical skill development was demonstrated to correspond to increasing age further reinforcing the developmental perspective on the acquisition of musical expertise. Some parents indicate that musical engagement has been pursued as a means of appropriately challenging children exhibiting the cognitive and affective characteristics of giftedness.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gifted children Australia</field><field name="subject">Musical ability</field><field name="subject">Music Instruction and study Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Currents, coasts and cays : a study of tidal upwelling and island wakes</field><field name="creator">Coutis, Peter F., School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the phenomenon of flow-topography interaction is considered in the context of two dynamically distinct case studies. In the first study, tidally-driven upwelling is investigated usingfield data collected in Hydrographers Passage (20????S), a narrow, navigable channel in the dense outer reef matrix of the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. In the second study, island wake formations at Cato Island (155????32????E, 23????15????S) in the deep, Western Coral Sea are examined using a combination of field data and numerical experiments. The result of the Hydrographers Passage study are of considerable scientific interest since they apply to numerous smaller non-navigable reef-edge passages dotted throughout the southern Great Barrier Reef. Strong, semi-diurnal flood tides flowing through a gap in a distal patch reef system at the shelf break generate strong upwelling, providing a pulsed, semi-diurnal input of nutrients to the reefs offshore of the passage. If stable in the long term, this mechanism could have profound evolutionary implications for large reefal areas in the southern Great Barrier Reef.  In the second study, two sets of field observations at Cato Island coincided with conditions of strong (~0.7m s-1), vertically sheared incident currents and weaker (~0.3m s-1), more variable incident flows. The combination of dynamically distinct flow regimes and a tall, steep-sided island penetrating oligotrophic surface waters provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of island wakes on hydrographic structure and biological enhancement. Field data indicate that flow disturbances downstream of Cato Island are likely to generate biological enhancement during conditions of eddy shedding and non-shedding wakes.  A primitive equation numerical model configured on the basis of field observations faithfully reproduces the key features of both data sets; mechanisms responsible for producing these key features are proposed. Previous numerical studies of island wakes have concentrated primarily on eddy shedding flows. In this thesis, the sub-critical (non-shedding) flow scenario is also considered. It is demonstrated that particle retention in island wakes has a ????hair trigger???? characteristic controlled by incident flow speed. This observation leads to a new proposal to explain the long-standing recruitment problem of biological oceanography.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wakes</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents</field><field name="subject">Upwelling</field><field name="subject">Oceanography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Owned by Nobody' : Health Status and its Determinants Among New South Wales Prisoners</field><field name="creator">Butler, Tony, School of Community Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">OBJECTIVES The overall aim of the project were to conduct a survey of the physical and mental health status of prisoners in New South Wales (NSW). A more specific aim, which is addressed in this PhD, was to analyse in detail a number of key health areas which have particular relevance to prisoner populations namely: tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, herpes simplex type 2 virus, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and drug and alcohol use.  METHODS A cross-sectional, random sample of prisoners, stratified by sex, age and Aboriginality was chosen from 27 correctional centres (24 male and 3 female) in NSW in 1996. Screening was conducted by nurses from within the correctional health system.  A detailed face-to-face interview was used to collect self-reported information on a range of physical and mental health characteristics, and behavioural issues. The physical health component covered chronic illness, recent symptoms, health services utilisation, medications, and self assessed health status. Mental health issues which were covered included: suicide attempts, self-harm, prior mental illness and psychiatric medication. Standardised screening instruments were used to test for depression, hopelessness and suicidal intent. Behavioural factors sought were drug and alcohol use, gambling, and sexual abuse. Blood samples were taken to screen for a range of infectious diseases and health indicators. These included HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex  type-2 virus, rubella, chlamydia, and hepatitis (B, C, and G). A Mantoux skin test was performed to screen for tuberculosis infection. Hearing was assessed using otoacoustic emissions.   RESULTS A total of 789 inmates (657 males and 132 females), including 235 Aboriginal people were screened, representing approximately 11% of males and 40% of females in full-time incarceration. For the key areas examined in the chapters we found: Overall health status ????	Overall health status was poor compared with the NSW general population in regard to self-reported chronic illness, recent health complaints, and well-being. Hospitalisation was less frequent in male prisoners than general community males but higher in female prisoners for mental health problems compared with community females. Tuberculosis ????	No previously undetected cases of tuberculosis were found; however, Mantoux positivity was higher in Aboriginal and overseas born prisoners. Viral hepatitis ????	Markers for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis G were significantly more common in the NSW prisoner population than in the general community. Significant disparities were found between prisoners???? self-report of past exposure to hepatitis (B and C) and their serostatus. Thirty five percent of inmates who were hepatitis C antibody positive believed that they were negative, and for hepatitis B, 72% of positives reported they were negative. Multivariate analysis identified Aboriginality, long-term injecting, and injecting while in prison as risk factors for HBV. Risk factors for exposure to HCV were female sex, non-Aboriginality, history of childhood institutionalisation, and injecting-related behaviours. For HGV, female sex, and previous imprisonment were significant risk factors but injecting was not; being aged 25-39 years was associated with a decreased risk for HGV as compared to younger and older inmates.  Herpes simplex virus type 2 ????	The prevalence of HSV-2 antibodies in this prisoner population was similar to that observed in NSW STD clinic attendees, and was higher in females than males. Exposure was related to: increasing age and Aboriginality for men, and higher reported number of lifetime sexual partners and the presence of hepatitis C antibodies for women. Few prisoners (1%) reported a previous diagnosis of genital herpes. Childhood sexual abuse ????	The prevalence of self-reported childhood sexual abuse was higher in females than males, and similar to that observed in clinical populations. There was an association between CSA and mental health outcomes, including a history of psychiatric treatment and suicide attempts. Male survivors of CSA were more likely to report self-harm, depression, and involvement in violent relationships. Both men and women with a history of CSA were more likely to report having a sexually transmissible disease (STD). Females exposed to CSA were more likely to report subsequent abusive adult relationships involving physical assault, sexual assault, and verbal abuse. Drug use ????	Overall, 64% of prisoners had used illicit drugs at some time in the past with cannabis (males 56%, females 63%) and heroin (males 29%, females 49%) being the most common. Forty four percent of prisoners had a history of injecting drug use, with injecting prevalence significantly higher in females than males (64% vs. 40%). Half of male and female injectors had done so while in prison. Harmful or hazardous use of alcohol was associated with imprisonment for violent crimes, whereas opiate and methadone use were associated with non-violent crimes. Sixty two percent of property offenders had an injecting history. Alcohol intoxication at the time of offending was associated with imprisonment for homicides and assaults. Males were more likely than females to seek treatment in prison for drug problems. IMPLICATIONS Prisoners in NSW have a number of special health needs which are evidenced in the high levels of infectious diseases (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis G, and herpes simplex virus type 2) and exposure to factors (childhood sexual abuse and alcohol and drug use) with a clear relationship to adverse health outcomes. Prisons represent an opportunity for public health interventions to address some of the health problems identified in this study. Potentially valuable programmes include education to prevent the spread of blood borne communicable diseases and STDs, immunisation for vaccine preventable diseases such as hepatitis B, and treatment to alleviate the effects of drug use and childhood sexual abuse. In the case of prison drug use the prison environment itself presents a threat to health in that sterile injecting equipment is not available to prisoners despite evidence that injecting in prison is widespread. The challenge for prison health planners is twofold: to make maximum use of the window of opportunity to improve the health status of this group, and to provide a continuum of care between the community and prison.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prisoners</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the GPS Data Processing Algorithm for Precise Static Relative Positioning</field><field name="creator">Satirapod, Chalermchon, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since its introduction in the early 1980????s, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become an important tool for high-precision surveying and geodetic applications. Carrier phase measurements are the key to achieving high accuracy positioning results. This research addresses one of the most challenging aspects in the GPS data processing algorithm, especially for precise GPS static positioning, namely the definition of a realistic stochastic model. Major contributions of this research are: (a)	A comparison of the two data quality indicators, which are widely used to assist in the definition of the stochastic model for GPS observations, has been carried out. Based on the results obtained from a series of tests, both the satellite elevation angle and the signal-to-noise ratio information do not always reflect the reality. (b)	A simplified MINQUE procedure for the estimation of the variance-covariance components of GPS observations has been proposed. The proposed procedure has been shown to produce similar results to those from the standard MINQUE procedure. However, the computational load and time are significantly reduced, and in addition the effect of a changing number of satellites on the computations is effectively dealt with. (c)	An iterative stochastic modelling procedure has been developed in which all error features in the GPS observations are taken into account. Experimental results show that by applying the proposed procedure, both the certainty and the accuracy of the positioning results are improved. In addition, the quality of ambiguity resolution can be more realistically evaluated. (d)	A segmented stochastic modelling procedure has been developed to effectively deal with long observation period data sets, and to reduce the computational load. This procedure will also take into account the temporal correlations in the GPS measurements. Test results obtained from both simulated and real data sets indicate that the proposed procedure can improve the accuracy of the positioning results to the millimetre level. (e)	A novel approach to GPS analysis based on a combination of the wavelet decomposition technique and the simplified MINQUE procedure has been proposed. With this new approach, the certainty of ambiguity resolution and the accuracy of the positioning results are improved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative Music Making in Hong Kong Secondary Schools: The Present Situation and Professional Development of Music Teachers</field><field name="creator">Leung, Bo Wah, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Present research provides strong support for the use of creative activities in school music programmes based on evidence that learning music is more effective when students are exposed to authentic, experiential learning activities, rather than verbal descriptions and explanations by the teacher. Based on this background the purpose of this study was to address the need to train music teachers with the confidence and skills necessary to incorporate creative music making in their classroom teaching.  The study was divided into two phases. Phase I included a questionnaire survey that investigated the current situation of music teaching in Hong Kong secondary schools. To extend this survey three composers and three curriculum planners were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews in order to survey their opinions and suggestions on creative music making. Based on the literature review and findings from Phase I, Phase II focused on the design of a teacher education programme that would prepare teachers to undertake creative activities in their classroom music teaching.  The programme was trialled twice with two groups of in-service music teachers studying at the Hong Kong Institute of Education. The trainees were asked to design their own creative projects that were taught during a four-week Teaching Practice session. Findings reveal that the most effective creative projects possessed a logical teaching sequence, addressed students???? musical preferences, and integrated listening and performing activities with the creative task. Findings suggest that Hong Kong music teachers should adopt the techniques proposed in this study when designing and implementing their teaching programmes in order to nurture the musical creativity of their students. Music teacher education programmes in Hong Kong should also consider revising their modules so that they provide more balance between theory and practice, and integrate subject-based knowledge with pedagogical skills. A major conclusion of the study is that music teaching in Hong Kong secondary schools would benefited from a balance between creating, performing and listening activities where teachers apply a student-centred approach to expose their students to active, experiential and reflective learning environments in which creative musical expression is fostered at all levels of student development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High schools -- China</field><field name="subject">School music -- Instruction and study -- China</field><field name="subject">Music teachers -- China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrosion behaviour of aluminised steel and conventional alloys in simulated aluminium smelting cell environments</field><field name="creator">Xu, Nan, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aluminium smelting is a high temperature electrometallurgical process, which suffers considerable inefficiencies in power utilization and equipment maintenance.  Aluminium smelting cell works in the extreme environments that contain extraordinarily aggressive gases, such as HF, CO and SO2.  Mild steel used as a structural material in the aluminium industry, can be catastrophically corroded or oxidized in these conditions.  This project was mainly concerned with extending the lifetime of metal structures installed immediately above the aluminium smelting cells.  An aluminium-rich coating was developed on low carbon steel A06 using pack cementation technique.  Yttria (Y2O3) was also used to improve the corrosion resistance of coating.  Kinetics of the coating formation were studied.  XRD, FESEM and FIB were employed to investigate the phase constitution and the surface morphology.  Together with other potentially competitive materials, aluminium-rich coating was evaluated in simulated plant environments.  Results from the long time (up to 2500h) isothermal oxidation of materials at high temperature (800??C) in air showed that the oxidation resistance of coated A06 is close to that of stainless steel 304 and even better than SS304 in cyclic oxidation tests.  Coated A06 was also found to have the best sulfidation resistance among the materials tested in the gas mixture contains SO2 at 800??C.  Related kinetics and mechanisms were also studied.  The superior corrosion resistance of the coated A06 is attributed to the slow growing alpha-Al2O3 formed.  Low temperature corrosion tests were undertaken in the gas mixtures containing air, H2O, HCl and SO2 at 400??C.  Together with SS304 and 253MA, coated A06 showed excellent corrosion resistance in all the conditions.  The ranking of the top three materials for corrosion resistance is: 253MA, coated A06 and SS304.  It is believed that aluminised A06 is an ideal and economical replacement material in the severe corrosive aluminium smelting cell environment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aluminium smelting cell</field><field name="subject">pack cementation process</field><field name="subject">iron aluminde</field><field name="subject">high temperature oxidation</field><field name="subject">high temperature sulfidation</field><field name="subject">chlorination</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">aluminum coatings</field><field name="subject">steel -- corrosion</field><field name="subject">corrosion resistant materials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turing machines, computers and artificial intelligence.</field><field name="creator">Krebs, Peter R., History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates some of the issues and consequences for the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, which are related to the perceived limits of computation with current digital equipment.

It is argued that the misinterpretation of the Church-Turing thesis has led to unfounded assumptions about the limitations of computing machines in general. Modern digital computers, which are based on the von Neuman architecture, can typically be programmed so that they interact effectively with the real word. It is argued that digital computing machines are supersets of Turing machines, if they are, for example, programmed to interact with the real world. Moreover, computing is not restricted to the domain of discrete state machines. Analog computers and real or simulated neural nets exhibit properties that may not be accommodated in a definition of computing, which is based on Turing machines.

Little is known of the clinical features, the epidemiology, and the antibiotic treatment of these strains.  Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting to Emergency Departments or Dermatology Clinics with staphylococcal infections. Patients were stratified into three groups, non-multiresistant ORSA (NORSA), multiresistant ORSA (MORSA) and oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus, and clinical comparisons made. Strains of NORSA and MORSA were typed using antibiograms, phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Antimicrobial studies were performed to compare different methods of detecting resistance to oxacillin and to non-beta-lactams. Time-kill studies were performed with one drug to explore killing kinetics. The interaction between drug combinations was examined using disk approximation and time-kill methodologies. A single point pharmacodynamic analysis was performed.  Results: There was an increase in infections with NORSA, MORSA and OSSA. NORSA strains appeared to be more virulent than OSSA and MORSA strains. NORSA was strongly associated with skin and soft tissue infections and with Polynesians. Most of the NORSA strains were related to New Zealand ????Western Samoan Phage Pattern???? (WSPP) isolates, and unrelated to community-acquired, non-multiresistant MRSA strains from Western Australia. Two patients were found to have British EMRSA-15 strains. NORSA strains were unrelated to MORSA strains. Resistance to rifampicin, fusidic acid, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim emerged in the time-kill assays. Combinations of antibiotics, particularly with ciprofloxacin, often showed antagonism. Gentamicin, fusidic acid, clindamycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and linezolid were predicted to perform well. Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, doxycycline, flucloxacillin and quinupristin/dalfopristin were predicted to fail.  Conclusions: WSPP strains of New Zealand and EMRSA-15 strains from Britain exist in South Western Sydney. These organisms are virulent, and increasing in incidence in several areas of Australia. Antimicrobial treatment of infections with these strains is problematic and requires further study.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Staphylococcus aureus</field><field name="subject">Oxacillin</field><field name="subject">methicillin</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">South Western Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Relatedness, Paternity and Male Alliances in Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Kr??tzen, Michael Christian, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, WA, form several levels of alliances. Determining the relationship between paternity, relatedness and alliance membership is crucial in seeking evolutionary adaptive explanations for alliance formation. Previous behavioural data have revealed a social system whose complexity is unparalleled outside humans. Pairs or trios of male dolphins cooperate as stable first-order (1? alliances to sequester and control reproductive females. Two 1?alliances sometimes cooperate as small second-order (2? alliances to attack other 1?alliances or defend against attacks. Some males choose a different strategy by forming large superalliances of approximately fourteen individuals to attack 1?and 2?alliances. Kinship appears to play a role in the structuring of male alliances, but its importance differs with the alliance type. Relatedness analyses showed that on average, males in 1?and 2?alliances are strongly related, while members of the superalliance are not. Further, the strength of the association of partners within the superalliance was not correlated with their genetic relatedness. Thus, within one sex, it appears that there may be more than one simultaneous mode of group formation and its evolution. There was also an association between alliance behaviour and reproductive success as predicted by some theories of group formation. I assigned nine paternities to six out of 107 mature males. Males with alliance partners were significantly more successful in fathering offspring than males without partners. Compared to non-allied males, the chance of obtaining a paternity was significantly higher for members of 1?alliances, and reproductive success was significantly skewed among 1?alliance members. Assessment of kinship and relatedness required a number of technical developments and some preliminary data. I first refined a biopsy system in order to obtain tissue samples from free-ranging dolphins with minimum behavioural effects irrespective of age-group or gender. Then I carried out population genetics analyses, which demonstrated that there was only weak population structure within Shark Bay. Microsatellites showed a weak pattern of isolation by distance, and eight haplotypes of the mitochondrial DNA control region suggested weak female philopatry. The high number of migrants between locations allowed all samples from East Shark Bay to be pooled for subsequent analyses.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bottlenosed dolphins -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms Conferring a Rhodococcus species with High Resistance to Benzene</field><field name="creator">Guti??rrez, Jos?? Antonio, School of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Gram-positive bacterium, Rhodococcus sp. 33, was selected for further study to identify the characteristics conferring it with high tolerance to concentrations of benzene. Since most organic solvents, like benzene, are lipophilic, they tend to accumulate within lipid membranes where they express toxicity. The mechanisms conferring this Rhodococcus with resistance to benzene were hypothesised to be located within the subcellular region of this bacterium - cell wall, membrane, and cell-bound polymer. Therefore, this investigation was instigated to identify these mechanisms. To accomplish this, the development of methodologies to isolate highly purified cell wall and membrane fractions, from the organism, were required. To corroborate this investigation, a total of 6 benzene-sensitive mutants were prepared from Rhodococcus sp. 33 and their characteristics compared to those of the parent wild-type strain. 1-D PAGE analysis of proteins revealed various benzene-induced wall, membrane, and cytoplasmic proteins in the w-t. A protein band, with an approximate molecular weight of 58 kDa, was identified to be absent in the most sensitive mutant isolated (mutant M2b). Interestingly, much of this research showed that the benzene-catabolising enzymes played an insignificant role in tolerating the benzene. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of whole cell-derived fatty acids revealed that benzene induced an increase in the ratios of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, protein determinations revealed that benzene induced an increase in the concentration of total membrane protein. These increases are suggestive as possible mechanisms to decrease the fluidity of the cell membrane. This was further supported by the observed increase in the generalised polarisation (GP) of laurdan fluorescence in the membranes during growth of the organism with benzene, which is correlated with a decrease in membrane fluidity. The organism was also found to synthesise hexadecenoic acid, 16:1w6c (11 - 13% of total fatty acids), an uncommon fatty acid and previously unreported in other Rhodococcus spp. Analysis of the organism's cell-bound extracellular polymer revealed it to be composed of polysaccharide with biosurfactant-like properties. Its function is proposed to act as a surfactant layer outside the cell, concentrating the benzene within its matrix and reducing benzene's contact with the cell membrane.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Actinomycetales</field><field name="subject">Benzene</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a novel magnetic photocatalyst : preparation, characterisation and implication for organic degradation in aqueous systems</field><field name="creator">Beydoun, Donia, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Magnetic photocatalysts were synthesised by coating a magnetic core with a layer of photoactive titanium dioxide.

The photoactivity of these Fe3O4/TiO2 was lower than that of single-phase TiO2 and was found to decrease with an increase in the heat treatment. These observations were explained in terms of an unfavourable heterojunction between the titanium dioxide and the iron oxide core. Fe ion diffusion from the iron oxide core into the titanium dioxide matrix upon heat treatment, leading to a highly doped TiO2 lattice, was also contributing to the observed low activities of these samples. These Fe3O4/TiO2 particles were found to be unstable, with photodissolution of the iron oxide phase being encountered. This photodissolution was dependent on the heat treatment applied, the greater the extent of the heat treatment, the lower the incidence of photodissolution. This was explained in terms of the stability of the iron oxide phases present, as well as the lower photoactivity of the titanium dioxide matrix. In fact, the observed photodissolution was found to be induced-photodissolution. That is, the photogenerated electrons in the titanium dioxide phase were being injected into the lower lying conduction band of the iron oxide core, leading to its reduction and then dissolution. Thus, the approach of directly depositing TiO2 onto the surface of a magnetic iron oxide core proved ineffective in producing a stable magnetic photocatalyst. The introduction of an intermediate passive SiO2 layer between the titanium dioxide phase and the iron oxide phase inhibited the direct electrical contact and hence prevented the photodissolution of the iron oxide phase. Improvements in the photoactivity were seen to be due to the inhibition of both the electronic and chemical interactions between the iron oxide and titanium dioxide phases. Preliminary optimisation experiments revealed that a thin SiO2 layer is sufficient for inhibiting the photodissolution. The thickness of the TiO2 coating was found not to have a significant effect on the photocatalytic performance of the coated particles. Finally, heat treating for 20 minutes at 450??C was sufficient for converting the titanium dioxide into a photoactive phase, longer heating times had no beneficial effect on the photoactivity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">magnetic photocatalyst</field><field name="subject">magnetic particles</field><field name="subject">magnetite</field><field name="subject">titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">water treatment</field><field name="subject">solid liquid separation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constant speed flows and the nonlinear Schr??dinger equation</field><field name="creator">Grice, Glenn Noel, Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates how the geometric connection between the integrable Heisenberg spin equation, the nonlinear Schr??dinger equation and fluid flows with constant velocity magnitude along individual streamlines may be exploited.

The program was of four days???? duration, and was delivered over a four-week period. It involved both in-class and out-of-class tasks, and required learners to analyse their own discourse practices, those of other learners, and those of the speech community in which they were living. The program had two principle objectives. Firstly, it asked whether learners are able to modify their discourse practices at will in order to achieve successful negotiation outcomes. Secondly, it explored the effect of deliberately altered discourse styles on perceptions of learners held by speech community members. The methodology employed to achieve these objectives was ethnographic in nature and involved the following processes: 1. Learners were video-taped negotiating with other learners before and after the program. 2. Learners undertook the program aimed at increasing their ability to negotiate in business environments using culturally appropriate spoken language in conjunction with compatible prosodic and paralinguistic features as well as conversation management strategies. Learners kept diaries of their experiences and self-evaluation, and were interviewed following the course. 3. A group of nine native speakers of English viewed the 'before' and 'after' video-tapes and completed a survey aimed at collecting and quantitatively measuring (change in) their perceptions of the learners. This change was statistically analysed using a repeated-measures t test. The effect proved statistically significant overall; t(80) = 1.990, p&amp;gt.01, two-tailed. 4. The 'before' and 'after' negotiations were then analysed by the researcher using ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis, modified to include some aspects of facial expression. The implications of the findings for teaching 'Business English', 'Global English' and 'Speaking' more generally are then discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language--Study and teaching--Australia</field><field name="subject">English language--Business English</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From shadow citizens to teflon stars : cultural responses to the digital actor</field><field name="creator">Bode, Lisa Merle, Theatre, Film &amp; Dance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines an intermittent uncanniness that emerges in cultural responses to new image technologies, most recently in some impressions of the digital actor. The history of image technologies is punctuated by moments of fleeting strangeness: from Maxim Gorky's reading of the cinematographic image in terms of 'cursed grey shadows', to recent renderings of the computer-generated cast of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as silicon-skinned mannequins. It is not merely the image's unfamiliar and new aesthetics that render it uncanny. Rather, the image is received within a cultural framework where its perceived strangeness speaks allegorically of what it means to be human at that historical moment. In various ways Walter Benjamin, Anson Rabinbach and N. Katherine Hayles have claimed that the notion and the experience of 'being human' is continuously transformed through processes related to different stages of modernity including rational thought, industrialisation, urbanisation, media and technology. In elaborating this argument, each of the four chapters is organized around the elucidation of a particular motif: 'dummy', 'siren', 'doppelg??nger' and 'resurrection'. These motifs circulate through discourses on different categories of digital actor, from those conceived without physical referents to those that are created as digital likenesses of living or dead celebrities. These cultural responses suggest that even while writers on the digital actor are speculating about the future, they are engaging with ideas about life, death and identity that are very old and very ambivalent.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">digital actor</field><field name="subject">cyberstar</field><field name="subject">synthespian</field><field name="subject">double</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">stars</field><field name="subject">media history</field><field name="subject">cinema history</field><field name="subject">Motion picture actors and actresses</field><field name="subject">Actors.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of shear-induced breakup and restructuring on the size and structure of aggregates</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Peter, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to use simulation as a tool to better understand areas of orthokinetic (shear-induced) aggregation which are still not well understood. These areas include aggregate structure, aggregate strength, breakup and restructuring and combined perikinetic/orthokinetic aggregation. Previous simulation studies were reviewed and it was concluded that the methodology of Chen and Doi (1989) was an appropriate starting point for this study. The modified simulation was validated by comparison with theoretical and experimental results.   Orthokinetic aggregates were found to have a fractal structure with an estimated value of 1.65. Scaling exponents, which were shown to be indicative of fractal dimension, of 2.1-2.7 were also obtained.  Flexible bonds allowed restructuring to occur which led to an increase in the co-ordination number, scaling exponent, aggregate strength and a reduction in aggregate size. Thus aggregate strength increases with fractal dimension. It was confirmed that both restructuring and breakup/reformation could lead to the formation of small, compact aggregates. The high shear conditions simulated favoured breakup/reformation, while restructuring was expected to dominate with more flexible bonds, possibly at lower shear rates.  Taking some account of hydrodynamic interactions by the inclusion of Kirkwood-Riseman theory led to an increase in the compactness of the aggregates and the co-ordination numbers, as well as a decrease in size of the aggregates. The results showed that hydrodynamic interactions can not be ignored. The explanation for the dramatic effects was that particles/microflocs on the outer edges of the aggregates broke off and reformed in a more compact way.  Erosion was found to dominate in all cases, thus supporting the theory that erosion dominates at higher fractal dimensions. The shearing range simulated was found to be relatively high (equivalent to &amp;lt200s-1 for particles of 2-5??m), producing relatively small aggregates. Hence it is proposed that under high shear conditions, erosion dominates.  It was shown by extension of the DLCA algorithmic restructuring work of Meakin and Jullien (1988, 1989) that the scattering patterns observed in gently sheared aggregating systems are consistent with the interpretation that the shearing causes partial restructuring at large length scales.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aggregates (Building materials)</field><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of calcineurin in high-renin and low-renin animal models of pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy</field><field name="creator">Benson, Victoria Louise, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in response to pressure overload is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, making its prevention an important therapeutic goal. The role of a calcineurin-dependent molecular pathway in the induction of pressure-overload LVH is controversial. The present study tested the hypothesis that, in the setting of LV pressure overload, activation of the systemic renin-angiotensin system was necessary for activation of this calcineurin pathway. Mild LV pressure overload was induced in male Wistar rats by abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) or transverse aortic arch constriction (TAC), producing well-matched pressure gradients of 37 ?? 8 and 35 ?? 15 mmHg, respectively. Tight transverse aortic arch constriction (TTAC) in additional animals produced a pressure gradient of 75 ?? 15 mmHg. Only AAC increased plasma renin concentration and activated the calcineurin pathway, indicated by increased nuclear NFAT3 content. Plasma renin concentration and nuclear NFAT3 content were unchanged in TAC and TTAC animals. AAC animals developed more LVH 21 days post-banding than TAC and TTAC animals: the slope of the relationship between LV/body weight ratio and systolic blood pressure was much steeper in AAC animals than the combined TAC and TTAC animals (20x10-6 versus 5x10-6, p&lt;0.001). Treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 did not significantly alter the slope of this relationship in the combined TAC and TTAC animals (8x10-6), but FK506 abolished this relationship in AAC animals (-5x10-6, R =0.0003). These data indicate that activation of the calcineurin pathway occurs only in high-renin hypertension, providing an additional stimulus to LVH induction. Calcineurin plays no role in the induction of LVH in low-renin hypertension, which is much more common clinically.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart</field><field name="subject">Hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Renin.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photocatalytic reduction of cadmium and selenium ions and the deposition of cadmium selenide</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nu Hoai Vi, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis, which can oxidise or reduce organic and inorganic pollutants, is a developing technology for water and wastewater treatment. The current work investigates the photocatalytic reduction of cadmium and selenium species as the presence of these elements in water are of environmental concern. Although TiO2 has been widely used for the photocatalytic process, its light absorption is limited to the UV region of the solar spectrum. Hence, the current project also explores the possibility to deposit cadmium selenide (CdSe) onto TiO2 to extend the photoresponse to the visible region. This study demonstrated that cadmium (Cd(II)) could be reduced to its metallic form by photocatalysis. The choice of hole scavengers and reaction pH are of importance in determining whether the photocatalytic reduction reaction will occur. It is also essential that both Cd(II) and organic additives are adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. A mechanism for cadmium photoreduction in the presence of formate as the hole scavenger was proposed. The current investigation elucidated the mechanism for the photoreduction of selenite (Se(IV)). Selenite was found to be photoreduced to its elemental form (Se(0)) as films, by direct photoreduction of Se(IV), and as discrete particles, by the reaction between Se(IV) and selenide (Se(2-)) ions. The Se(2-) ions are believed to have been generated from the 6 electron photoreduction of Se(IV) and/or the further photoreduction of the Se(0) deposits. Photocatalytic reduction reactions of Se(IV) and selenate (Se(VI)) using different commercial TiO2 materials was also studied. The current work also successfully deposited CdSe by photocatalysis using Se-TiO2 obtained from the photoreduction of Se(IV) and Se(VI). The mechanism for CdSe deposition was clarified and attributed to the reaction of Cd(II) present in the system and the Se(2-) released from the reduction of Se(0) upon further illumination. The Se??TiO2 photocatalysts obtained from the photoreduction of different selenium precursors (Se(IV) and Se(VI)) resulted in the dominance of different morphologies of the CdSe particles. This suggests a new approach to manipulate the properties of CdSe during its formation, and hence control over electrical and optical properties of this semiconductor.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cadmium selenide</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Selenium</field><field name="subject">Cadmium.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurements of optical turbulence on the Antarctic Plateau and their impact on astronomical observations.</field><field name="creator">Travouilon, Tony, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atmospheric turbulence results taken on the Antarctic plateau are presented in this thesis. Covering two high sites: South Pole and Dome C, this work describes their seeing and meteorological conditions. Using an acoustic sounder to study the turbulence profile of the first kilo- metre of the atmosphere and a Differential Image Motion Monitor (DIMM) to investigate the integrated seeing we are able to deduce important at- mospheric parameters such as the Fried parameter (r0) and the isoplanatic angle (??0). It was found that at the two sites, the free atmosphere (above the first kilometer) was extremely stable and contributed between 0.2" and 0.3" of the total seeing with no evidence of jet or vortex peaks of strong turbulence. The boundary layer turbulence is what differentiates the two sites. Located on the Western flank of the plateau, the South Pole is prone to katabatic winds. Dome C on the other hand is on a local maximum of the plateau and the wind conditions are amongst the calmest in the world. Also linked to the topography is the vertical extent of the temperature in- version that is required to create optical turbulence. At the South Pole the inversion reaches 300 m and only 30 m at Dome C. This difference results in relatively poor seeing conditions at the South Pole (1.8") and excellent at Dome C (0.27"). The strong correlation between the seeing and the ground layer meteorological conditions indicates that even better seeing could be found at Dome A, the highest point of the plateau. Having most of the turbulence near the ground is also incredibly ad- vantageous for adaptive optics. The isoplanatic angle is respectively 3.3" and 5.7" for the South Pole and Dome C. This is significantly larger than at temperate sites where the average isoplanatic angle rarely exceeds 2". This means that wider fields can be corrected without the complication of conjugation to specific layers. For such purpose the potential is even more interesting. We show that ground conjugated adaptive optics would decrease the natural seeing to 0.22" for a wide field of 10 and 0.47" for a field of 1" at the South Pole. At Dome C the results are less impressive due to the already excellent seeing, but a gain of 0.1&amp;quote can still be achieved over 1&amp;quote. These results show that high angular resolution observations can be done better on the Antarctic plateau than any other known site.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Astrophysics</field><field name="subject">atmospheric turbulence</field><field name="subject">site testing</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Observations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation of cementite from hematite and titanomagnetite iron ore and its stability</field><field name="creator">Longbottom, Raymond James, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project examined the reduction and formation of cementite from hematite and titanomagnetite ores and cementite stability. The aim of the project was to develop further understanding of cementite stability under conditions relevant to direct ironmaking and the mechanism of cementite decomposition. The reduction of hematite and ironsand by hydrogen-methane-argon gas mixtures was investigated from 600??C to 1100??C. Iron oxides were reduced by hydrogen to metallic iron, which was carburised by methane to form cementite. The hematite ore was reduced more quickly than the ironsand. Preoxidation of the ironsand accelerated its reduction. Hematite was converted to cementite faster than preoxidised ironsand. The decomposition of cementite formed from hematite was investigated from 500??C to 900??C. This cementite was most stable at temperatures 750-770??C. The decomposition rate increased with decreasing temperature between 750??C and 600??C and with increasing temperature above 770??C. The stability of cementite formed from pre-oxidised titanomagnetite was studied from 300??C to 1100??C. This cementite was most stable in the temperature range 700-900??C.

Experiments were performed using stirred cell equipment, polymeric membranes and synthetic surface water containing natural organics, inorganic colloids and their aggregates, and cations. All processes could remove a significant amount of natural organics. Pretreatment with ferric chloride was required to achieve significant organic removal with MF and high MWCO UF. Additionally, fouling mechanisms for the three processes were investigated. Crucial parameters were aggregate characteristics (fractal structure, stability, organic-colloid interactions), solubility of organics and calcium, and hydrodynamics. In MF, fouling by pore plugging was most severe. Variations in solution chemistry changed the aggregation state of the colloids and/or natural organic matter and dramatically affected rejection and fouling behaviour. UF membrane fouling was mainly influenced by pore adsorption and could improve natural organics rejection significantly. Coagulant addition shifted fouling mechanism from pore adsorption to cake formation. Aggregate structure was most significant for flux decline. In NF, rejection of natural organics involved both size and charge exclusion. Fouling was caused by precipitation of a calcium-organic complex. Fouling could be avoided by pretreatment with metal salt coagulants. Thorough chemical characterisation of the organics used demonstrated that only size and aromaticity can be related to fouling. The study is concluded with a process comparison based on a water quality parameter and a cost comparison. Treatment cost of microfiltration with chemical pretreatment was similar to that of nanofiltration at a comparable natural organics rejection.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural organic matter</field><field name="subject">microfiltration</field><field name="subject">ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">nanofiltration</field><field name="subject">removal</field><field name="subject">fouling</field><field name="subject">cations</field><field name="subject">cost</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of ferromagnetic embolisation hyperthermia in the treatment of liver cancer</field><field name="creator">Tsafnat, Naomi, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Both primary and secondary liver cancers are common and the majority of patients are not eligible for surgical resection or a liver transplant, which are considered the only hope of cure. Mortality rates are high and there is a need for alternative treatment options. New forms of local treatment work best on small tumours; large ones, however, remain difficult to treat. Hyperthermia involves heating tumours to 40??-44?? C. The aim is to heat the entire tumour without damaging the surrounding normal tissue. Treating deep seated tumours is technically challenging. Ferromagnetic embolisation hyperthermia (FEH) is a novel method of treating liver tumours. Magnetic microspheres are infused into the hepatic artery and lodge primarily in the tumour periphery. An applied alternating-current magnetic field causes the microspheres to heat. Animal experiments have shown that this is a promising technique. There is a need for modelling of FEH prior to commencement of clinical trials. Analytical and numerical models of tumour heating during FEH treatment are presented here. The models help predict the temperature distributions that are likely to arise during treatment and give insight into the factors affecting tumour and liver heating. The models incorporate temperature-dependent thermal properties and blood perfusion rates of the tissues and a heterogeneous clustering of microspheres in the tumour periphery. Simulations show that the poorly perfused tumours heat preferentially while the liver is effectively cooled by blood flow from the portal vein. A peripheral distribution of heat sources produces a more even temperature field throughout the tumour, compared to a heat source that is centred within the tumour core. Large tumours reach higher temperatures and have higher heating rates, supporting experimental findings. Using temperature-dependent, rather than constant, values for thermal conductivities and blood perfusion rates results in higher temperatures within the tumour. The uneven clustering of microspheres in the tumour periphery leads to a more heterogeneous temperature distribution in the core, but it has less of an effect on the wellperfused liver. The results show that FEH has the potential to effectively treat liver tumours and the technique merits further investigation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bio-heat transfer</field><field name="subject">hyperthermia</field><field name="subject">numerical modeling</field><field name="subject">liver cancer</field><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust and power-distance: cross-cultural issues in juvenile justice conferencing</field><field name="creator">Sivasubramaniam, Diane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conferencing is a Restorative Justice practice operating in juvenile justice systems in Australia. Some conferences are convened by police, despite research demonstrating that ethnic minority youth often view police as biased or untrustworthy. Justice research in evaluative legal procedures indicates that perceived third party bias and outcomes delivered by a third party affect fairness judgments. Many disputants regard conferences as more fair than court. However, psychological mechanisms underlying fairness judgments in conferences, where offenders participate in outcome decisions, have not been directly investigated. This research program examined the effects of outcome and perceived convenor bias on procedural and distributive justice ratings in conferencing. Past research indicates that people high and low on Hofstede??s power-distance dimension differ in their emphases on outcome and third party bias when forming fairness judgments. This thesis investigated whether power-distance moderated the interactive effect of trust and outcome on fairness judgments in conferences. Study 1 established power-distance variation in a university sample, and similarity with a community sample on perceived police bias. Study 2 confirmed that high power-distance people who consider police biased against them may nonetheless choose to participate in police-convened conferences. Studies 3 and 4 extended previous research examining interactive effects of trust and outcome on justice judgments in evaluative procedures, investigating whether power-distance moderated this effect. No significant effects of power-distance and trust emerged, but the findings demonstrated the importance of outcome fairness (correspondence between outcomes and beliefs) in determining procedural justice. Studies 5, 6 and 7 extended this investigation to conferencing procedures. Studies 6 and 7 employed a computer-simulation, allowing participants to interact with a conference transcript and select outcomes, thereby investigating the effects of trust and power-distance on outcome choice, as well as the effects of trust, power-distance, and outcome on justice evaluations. Studies 5 and 6 were unsuccessful in manipulating bias by varying convenor identity (police versus civilian). Study 7 successfully manipulated bias according to convenor behaviour and revealed that third party bias in conferencing affected outcome choices but not fairness judgments. Results are discussed in terms of implications for culturally-relevant police practices, procedural justice theory and conferencing policy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Juvenile justice</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of workplace air contaminants</field><field name="creator">Bakand, Shahnaz, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Exposure to air contaminants is significantly associated with both short-term and long-term health effects. However, the precise mechanisms that derive such effects are not always understood. While an extensive background database from in vivo toxicological studies have been developed, most toxicity data is from oral and dermal chemical exposures rather than inhalation exposure. There is a need to explore new alternative approaches to provide toxicity information particularly on this technically demanding area. This research explores the potential of in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of workplace air contaminants. A tiered approach for in vitro toxicity testing of workplace contaminants was designed in which appropriate air sampling and exposure techniques were developed. A diversified battery of in vitro assays including the MTS (tetrazolium salt, Promega), NRU (neutral red uptake, Sigma) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate, Promega) and a multiple human cell system including: A549- lung derived cells; HepG2-liver derived cells, and skin fibroblasts were used. Primarily the application and merits of in vitro methods for prediction of toxicity of selected workplace contaminants including Ammonium hydroxide, Cadmium chloride, Cobalt chloride, Formaldehyde, Glutaraldehyde, Manganese chloride, Mercuric chloride, Sodium dichromate, Sulphureous acid and Zinc chloride was confirmed. To study the toxicity of airborne contaminants an indirect exposure method was established using air sampling techniques followed by static and dynamic direct exposure methods by culturing cells on porous membranes to reveal representative data relating to human airborne exposures. The static method enabled the measurement of an airborne IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) value for selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including: Xylene (IC50 = 5,350-8,200 ppm) and Toluene (IC50 = 10,500- 16,600 ppm) after 1 hr exposure. By implementing the dynamic method, airborne IC50 values were calculated for gaseous contaminants including: NO2 (IC50 = 11 ?? 3.54 ppm; NRU), SO2 (IC50 = 48 ?? 2.83 ppm; ATP) and NH3 (IC50 = 199 ?? 1.41 ppm; MTS). A higher sensitivity of in vitro methods was observed compared to in vivo published data. A range of in vitro bioassays in conjunction with exposure techniques developed in this thesis may provide an advanced technology for a comprehensive risk assessment of workplace air contaminants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicity testing - In vitro</field><field name="subject">Chemicals - Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Air - Pollution - Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Occupational exposure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of chemical defence in a filamentous marine red alga</field><field name="creator">Paul, Nicholas Andrew, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">I investigated the ecological functions of halogenated secondary metabolites from the red alga Asparagopsis armata, their localisation in specialised cells and also their cost of production. A. armata produces large amounts of halogenated metabolites ( &amp;lt 20 ??g / mg dry weight) that are sequestered in gland cells, as was demonstrated with light, epifluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular structures were identified that likely assist the release of metabolites from the gland cells to the algal surface. The halogenated metabolites of A. armata have multiple ecological roles, functioning as both inhibitors of bacterial fouling and as herbivore deterrents. Their activity against bacteria and herbivores was measured by a novel test in which the metabolites were manipulated in A. armata by omitting bromide ions from the culture media. This technique prevented the production of halogenated metabolites, but did not impact on other aspects of algal biology. Algae lacking halogenated metabolites (bromide [-] algae) had higher densities of epiphytic bacteria than those that continued to produce metabolites (bromide [+] algae). Bioassays with pure compounds against individual bacterial isolates further supported an inhibitory role for the halogenated metabolites against epiphytic bacteria, and also indicated an affect on bacterial community structure as well as abundance. Bromide (+) A. armata produced halogenated metabolites that also deterred feeding by two herbivores (an amphipod and an abalone), but not a third (an opisthobranch mollusc). A novel outcome from these feeding assays was the demonstration of a relationship between herbivore size and consumption of the chemically defended A. armata by the abalone Haliotis rubra. In addition to the fitness benefits gained from chemical defence, there were also costs for allocating resources to secondary metabolites. These costs were only detected under limiting light resources, consistent with predictions of the plant defence models. The integration of chemical analyses and cellular measures of chemical defence proved essential in elucidating resource allocation to chemical defence in the filamentous stage of A. armata. This thesis highlights that the simple relationships between growth and defence in filamentous algae can provide an excellent model for studies of the ecology and evolution of chemical defences in marine algae.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine chemical ecology</field><field name="subject">Marine metabolites</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Red algae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and role of rhizomorphs of Armillaria luteobubalina</field><field name="creator">Pareek, Mamta, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two different types of rhizomorphs were produced by A. luteobubalina in vitro conditions - aerial and submerged. They differed in growth rate, amount of mucilage, extent of peripheral hyphae, degree of pigmentation and in the structure of inner cortex. Otherwise they had a similar internal structure comprising 4 radial zones, namely, peripheral hyphae, outer cortex, inner cortex and medulla. Two membrane permeant symplastic fluorescent tracers, carboxy-DFFDA and CMAC which ultimately sequestered in vacuoles, behaved in a similar fashion in aerial and submerged rhizomorphs regardless of whether pigment was present in the outer cortical cell walls or in the extracellular material. Rhizomorphs appeared to be mostly impermeable to these probes with exception of a few fluorescent patches that potentially connected peripheral hyphae to inner cortical cells. In contrast, the apoplastic tracer HPTS which was applied to fresh material and its localisation determined in semi-thin (dry) sections following anhydrous freeze substitution appeared to be impeded by the pigmentation in cell walls and/or the extracellular material in the outer cortical zone. Structures identified as air pores arose directly from the mycelium and grew upwards into the air. A cluster of rhizomorph apices is initiated immediately beneath the air pores. As air pores elongated they differentiated into a cylindrical structure. Mature air pores became pigmented as did also the surface mycelium of the colony. The pigmented surface layer extended into the base of air pores, where it was elevated into a mound by tissue inside the base of the air pore. Beneath the pigmented surface layer there was a region of loose hyphae with extensive gas space between them. This gas space extended into the base of the air pore and was continuous with the central gas canal of rhizomorphs. Oxygen is conducted through the air pores and their associated rhizomorph gas canals into the oxygen electrode chamber with a conductivity averaging 679??68x10-12 m3s-1. The time averaged oxygen concentration data from the oxygen electrode chamber were used to compare three different air pore diffusion models. It was found that the widely used pseudo-steady-state model overestimated the oxygen conductivity. Finally, a model developed on the basis of fundamental transport equations was used to calculate oxygen diffusivities. This model gave a better comparison with the experimental data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhizomorph</field><field name="subject">armillaria</field><field name="subject">oxygen diffusivity</field><field name="subject">airpore</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, construction and testing of a high-vacuum anneal chamber for in-situ crystallisation of silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="creator">Weber, J??rgen Wolfgang, Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Engergy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film solar cells on glass substrates are likely to have a bright future due to the potentially low costs and the short energy payback times. Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si, grain size &amp;gt 1 pm) has the advantage of being non-toxic, abundant, and long-term stable. Glass as a substrate, however, limits the processing temperatures to ~600??C for longer process steps. Films with large grain size can be achieved by solid phase crystallisation (SPC), and especially by solid phase epitaxy (SPE) on seed layers, using amorphous silicon deposited at low temperatures as a precursor film. With SPC and SPE, the amorphous silicon film is typically crystallised at ~600??C over hours. During this anneal at atmospheric pressure -depending on the properties of the amorphous silicon film- ambient gas can percolate the film and can negatively affect the crystallisation. In this work, a high-vacuum anneal chamber was designed and built to allow the in-situ crystallisation of amorphous silicon films deposited on glass in a PECVD cluster tool. An important aspect of the design was the comfortable and safe operation of the vacuum anneal chamber to enable unattended operation. This was realised by means of a state-of-the-art, programmable temperature controller and a control circuit design that incorporates various safety interlocks. The chamber interior was optimised such that a temperature uniformity of 2-3K across the sample area was achieved. The chamber was calibrated and tested, and SPC and SPE samples were successfully crystallised. In initial SPC crystallisation experiments with solar cell structures, after post-deposition treatments, a 1 -sun open-circuit voltage of 465 mV was obtained, similar to furnace-annealed samples. In initial experiments with SPE solar cell structures, difficulties regarding the characterisation of the unmetallised solar cells with the quasi-steady-state open-circuit voltage method (QSSVOC) were encountered after post-deposition hydrogen treatment. A possible explanation for these difficulties is the contact formation with the metal probes. Furthermore, limiting factors of the QSSVOC method for the characterisation of unmetallised cells with high contact resistance values were investigated and, additionally, the accuracyof the QSSVOC setup was improved in the low light intensity range.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vacuum

Socio-Emotional Verbal Behaviors</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of communication differences in effective and ineffective teams. It investigates task and socio-emotional verbal behaviours over time and its relationship to team effectiveness and team members' self-perceived member viability. The author used an aural observational method to examine verbal communication of three teams. Participants were post-graduate students formed into teams, working on a complex and dynamic task over a project duration of five days in a classroom setting. Spoken interaction was audio recorded and analysed using Bales' (1950) Interaction Process Analysis (IPA). Three questionnaires were developed, mainly by combining existing measurement instruments from communication and small group research, measuring team effectiveness and member viability.  The analysis of selected team meetings with IPA displayed interesting task and socio&#172;emotional communication differences in effective and ineffective teams. These differences were more visible in socio-emotional interaction than in task-related interaction. Observed interaction patterns changed over time, although communication behaviours were more stable in the effective teams. Findings indicate that a consistently high level of positive socio-emotional communication in combination with a consistently low level of negative socio-emotional interaction seem to facilitate team effectiveness, while a high level of negative socio-emotional interaction or constantly changing socio-emotional behaviour seems to inhibit team effectiveness. It seems to suggest that communication behaviours impact upon team effectiveness and member viability. When communication behaviours could be described as task focused with a consistent level of positive reactions, outweighing negative reactions, effectiveness and member viability can increase. Opposite behaviours, shifting from task to interpersonal issues in combination with negative reactions outweighing positive reactions can lead to low levels of perceived member viability and a lack of effectiveness. The results lead to the suggestion that communication behaviours and member viability, particularly cohesion and willingness to continue as a member of this team, seem to be indicators for a team's 'well-being' and impact upon its effectiveness. These factors seem to be especially visible at the beginning and the temporal midpoint of a project. During these two periods, monitoring of the team process is recommended, either self-managed or with support from outside the team in order to prevent communication problems impacting on team effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teams.</field><field name="subject">Workplace.</field><field name="subject">Groups.</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Team members.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Otse Mbaka, This is who we are: Cultural Loss, Change and Recuperation in Ovamboland</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the terms of cultural change in north central Namibia.  I am primarily concerned with issues of agency in the processes which result in cultural change, and look at both historical and contemporary agents of change in order to determine who and what impacts cultural dynamism, and what implications this has for a newly independent country within a globalised world.  These issues are presented through the lenses of Identity, Power and Politics and Globalisation.   In this thesis, I posit that traditionally, Ovambo people have not been empowered in decisions regarding cultural change, which has resulted in a sense of cultural 'loss'.  This sense exists within the context of culture being seen as strongly associated with the past - past practices, activities, traditions and customs, as well as early development theory which insisted that such things were indicative of a backward and primitive society at odds with the principles of modernisation.  In order to progress, such practices were, with and without reticence, abandoned or changed.  Contemporary Ovamboland, however, represents a dynamic cultural m&#233;lange of traditional and modern life, which co-exist whilst negotiating issues such as the impact of HIV/AIDS and neo-liberal style of post-independence democracy.   Therefore, by investigating the cultural shortfall in traditional development theory, and using examples of different forms of cultural development, I suggest that when culture is seen as an important consideration of development, as well as supported as a field of development in its own right, cultural identity becomes clearer, and cultural futures are determined more democratically.  In order to demonstrate these ideas, I am drawing from a number of case studies in which I was professionally involved, as well as through interviews conducted in the field.  By presenting the differing agendas of international engagement in development work as well as different types of cultural development projects, I will highlight the complexities of development theory in practice, particularly when capital is involved, and how these relate to the wider issues of cultural preservation versus cultural change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social Change</field><field name="subject">Cultural Policy</field><field name="subject">Namibia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable livelihoods approach and community development in practice in engineering organisations</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis explored the limitations and challenges to a grassroots engineering non&#172;government organisation for the use of the sustainable livelihoods approach in a community development scenario. The sustainable livelihoods approach is a relatively new approach developed to address the failure of previous approaches to community development. Its key focuses are holistic, people-centred, dynamic and sustainable development, working with people's strengths and establishing macro-micro links. The role of engineering activities in community development is vital in the provision of technology and is visible across water, sanitation, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors. Again, however, community development activities in technology have not proven successful, thus the move towards the increasingly promoted approach of sustainable livelihoods. The major proponents of the sustainable livelihoods approach have developed many case studies and guidelines to address the contrasts in practice between sustainable livelihoods and current practice, common across many sectors including health, education and agriculture, to name a few. Such research into the contrasts and likeness of engineering practice in particular in community development through the sustainable livelihoods approach has not been explored. This research aims to address this gap. A case study of a Nepali engineering non-government organisation was used to explore these limitations and challenges to practice. Participatory methodologies were used to ensure that results and opportunities were identified from within the organisation itself. Data was collected through workshops, focus groups, interviews, surveys and overt observation. Cycles of systemic analyses were used to explore the problem situations for sustainable livelihoods practice as identified by the case study, and to develop systemically feasible and culturally desirable changes. Two approaches to these analyses, one based on logic, and the other based on culture, addressed the complexities characteristic of the community development and engineering sectors. Data was also collected from external stakeholders directly associated with the engineering activities of the case-study organisation to define the context for the research and verify that collected from the primary case-study organisation. The key findings of the data collection phase were seven problem areas for the organisation in the case study: providing community infrastructure and improving  livelihoods; adopting a sustainable livelihoods approach; meeting the need for community participation; monitoring and evaluation; developing partnerships; learning about sustainable livelihoods; and addressing the role of community technology.  Conceptual models were developed for analysis of the key problem situations. Systemic analyses of the key stakeholders, limitations, and the political and social contexts and the conceptual models identified the disparities between the ideal practice and the reality of practice for each problem situation. Whilst the research aimed to explore practice specifically for engineering, the majority of the results from the case study focused on changes for the early establishment of an organisation in the field of sustainable livelihoods. Key challenges for the grassroots organisation in the case study included limitations to the learning capacity of the organisation, imbalances of power with higher level partners, and, importantly, issues of risk and survival. Real and practical changes to the practice of community development organisations based on the case study included using more participatory methodologies, addressing scheduling issues, developing bottom-up activities and more effective partnerships with donors.  These were limitations general to non-sector-specific organisations. The research subsequently explored the challenges specific to engineering organisations in adopting the sustainable livelihoods approach. These focused on ensuring that engineering in community development incorporates not only the natural and non&#172;natural elements of intended community users but also the human elements. Five areas of practice were identified as being affected by the sustainable livelihoods approach, including the nature of technology, the processes for its development, the supporting role of national and international policies and standards, and the culture of engineering, specifically the role of engineering expertise and education. The opportunities in these areas of practice for sustainable livelihoods focused on ensuring a people-centred approach to engineering for community development. The research had implications for the practices of a variety of engineering organisations in the community development sector, including NGOs, standards organisations, legislative and regulatory bodies and educators. Again, these implications focused on ensuring that engineering in community development directly reflected the priorities, skills and dynamics of the intended community users.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">sustainable</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Nepal</field><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Evolution During the Preparation and Heating of Nanophase Zirconia Gels</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">The chemical preparation of ceramic materials has been widely studied over the past few decades, and provides the potential for excellent control over the microstructure and properties of the final product. This control is dependent on a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and physical/chemical processes that occur at each stage. Aqueous routes have much potential for adoption by industry, but in many cases a comprehensive understanding of the microstructure and chemistry is lacking, partly due to the complicated aqueous chemistry of many transition-metals. This investigation has focussed on a specific inorganic, aqueous, sol-gel route for the preparation of pure zirconia (Zr02). Zirconia is a ceramic with a wide range of current and potential applications, such as catalysis, fuel-cells, coatings and biomaterials. The emphasis has been placed on the characterisation of the structure at each stage of the route, leading to an understanding of the various mechanisms that are at work. This project has also provided an opportunity to investigate broader issues concerning the solution-based processing of zirconia, particularly those involving the 'metastable' tetragonal phase. This phase is frequently observed to be formed by non-equilibrium methods, but the mechanisms of formation and de-stabilisation are not properly understood. The studied route consists of a number of stages: the preparation of an aqueous sol of 'zirconium hydroxide' particles by forced hydrolysis of a zirconyl nitrate solution; the conversion of the sol to a gel by removal of the aqueous phase; the conversion of the gel to a crystalline tetragonal zirconia powder by heating; and transformation of the tetragonal phase to the stable monoclinic phase with further treatment. At each stage of processing a number of aspects of the material structure have been investigated, including the short-range order, crystalline lattice parameters, particle packing, porosity, and speciation of the nitrate anion. This has required a wide range of complementary characterisation techniques, including Raman spectroscopy, XRD, TEM, DTA/TGA, SAXS, dynamic light scattering, EXAFS, NMR, and nitrogen sorption. The importance of techniques that allow changes in structure to be characterised in-situ during heating has been emphasised. The particles in the sol and gel are plate-shaped, approximately 0.5 nm thick and 3 - 4 nm across. They are composed of up to several stacked `sheets' of zirconium hydroxide, each of which is composed of zirconium atoms arranged in a regular square lattice, joined by double hydroxy-bridges. Detailed evidence for this structure has not been previously reported. The stages of decomposition of the precursor have been elucidated, including the stages at which oxolation and loss of nitrate occur. The complex crystallisation process at 450&#176;C has been investigated, and a structural mechanism for crystallisation of the 'metastable' tetragonal phase proposed, based on similarities between the tetragonal crystal structure and the disordered sheet structure in the amorphous material just prior to crystallisation. The crystalline material consists of nano-sized crystals, containing unusual intracrystalline mesopores. The lattice parameters of the tetragonal phase change with increasing heat treatment, with the unit-cell tetragonality (c/a) increasing from 1.017 to 1.020. This is a previously-unreported phenomenon which may be associated with the stability of the phase. The tetragonal phase transforms to the monoclinic phase after heating to a 'critical temperature' between 900 and 950&#176;C; this temperature is associated with the loss of residual surface nitrate species and/or a substantial increase in the mass diffusion rate. The crystal size and surface area has little influence on the tetragonal-to-monoclinic transformation, a result which is contrary to much previously-published work and that has significant implications for certain theories explaining the stability of the tetragonal phase. The transformation itself occurs during cooling, over a range between 400 and 100&#176;C, and has been studied in-situ by time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. The conclusions of this investigation contribute not only to the understanding of this particular route for processing zirconia, but also to a broader understanding of aqueous zirconium systems, the chemical processing of zirconia, and the tetragonal-to-monoclinic zirconia transformation mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zirconium oxide</field><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Vitro Regulation of Growth, Differentiation and Survival of Leukemic CD5+ B Cells</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a hematologic neoplasm characterised by the proliferation and accumulation of sIgM+/D+ B cells that fail to progress to the final stages of B cell development. The malignant cells in B-CLL also express the pan-T cell antigen CD5, suggesting that CLL is a malignancy of the CD5+ subset of B cells. Additional characteristics of the malignant clone include a low proliferative index, enhanced in vivo survival and constitutive expression of the anti-apoptosis oncoprotein bcl-2. The behaviour of leukemic CD5 B cells in vitro contrasts their arrested in vivo state. That is, despite the majority of cells being arrested in the G0 phase of the cell cycle, the leukemic B cells are not irreversibly frozen as they can be induced to differentiate to Ig-secreting cells under appropriate in vitro conditions. Furthermore, leukemic CD5 B cells rapidly undergo death by apoptosis following in vitro culture. This thesis describes the requirements for in vitro activation of leukemic CD5+ B cells, the characterisation of the events involved in apoptosis of these cells as well as the identification of various growth factors capable of modulating these events. Stimulation of unfractionated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from three patients with B-CLL with the phorbol ester PMA and the mitogens PHA and PWM resulted in significant increases in cell proliferation, RNA synthesis and 1gM secretion when compared to unstimulated cell populations. PMA was the most potent inducer of 1gM secretion and this occurred irrespective of the presence of residual T cells. PMA-induced proliferation and RNA synthesis were also independent of T cells. However, in the presence of T cells, these parameters of cellular activation were enhanced during in vitro culture. Thus, the inductive ability of PMA on leukemic CD5 B cells was independent of T cells. In contrast, activation and differentiation of the leukemic CD5 B cells into 1gM-secreting cells following culture with mitogens did not occur in the absence of T cells. Interestingly, co-stimulation of leukemic CD5+ B cells with PMA and anti-Ig induced cellular responses that exceeded those induced by either activator alone. Thus, leukemic CD5+ B cells from patients with B-CLL can be activated in vitro and differentiate in response to stimulation via both T cell-dependent and T cell-independent mechanisms. Apoptotic cell death was characterised in purified leukemic CD5 B cells obtained from six B-CLL patients. All leukemic CD5 B cell populations entered an apoptotic pathway in vitro as evidenced by a reduction in cell size, loss of cell viability and fragmentation of DNA into multimers of  -180 base pairs. Following 24 hours of in vitro culture 24.0&#177;16% of DNA was fragmented. After 8 days, the majority of DNA was fragmented, and fewer than 10% of cultured cells were viable. Examination of bcl-2 expression in the malignant B cells by flow cytometry revealed a unimodal pattern of expression in greater than 85% of cells from each B-CLL patient prior to culture. During in vitro culture, bcl-2 expression became bimodal such that the B cells displayed a bcl-2hjgh and bcl-2iow phenotype. The level of expression by the bCl2hjgh cells was similar to that observed prior to in vitro culture, indicating that bcl-2 is down-regulated in apoptosing cells. Interestingly, despite this downregulation, the overall number of cells positive for bcl-2 remained constant. This suggests that the enhanced survival of leukemic CD5+ B cells in vivo is mediated by the sustained expression of bcl-2 and that additional mechanisms exist capable of overriding the protective effect of bcl-2 when bcl-2 is present at reduced levels. Leukemic B cell apoptosis has previously been reported to be delayed or prevented by IL-4, IFN-y and IFN-a. These results were confirmed in this study where it was found that culture of leukemic CD5 B cells with IL-4 or IFN-y enhanced cell viability and delayed apoptosis in 6/6 and 5/6 populations of leukemic B cells, respectively. This function was also found to be shared by IL-2, IL-6, IL-13 and TNF-a as these cytokines enhanced cell viability and delayed apoptosis in some of the cell populations examined at a level similar to that observed for IL-4 and IFN-y. These cytokines may mediate their effect via the expression of bcl2 as culture in the presence of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IFN-y or TNF-a resulted in a higher percentage of cells displaying the bcl-2high phenotype, compared to unstimulated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that autocrine and/or paracrine growth loops may play a role in the pathogenesis of B-CLL and that cytokines that prevent apoptosis in vitro may be targets for treatment of this B cell malignancy.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic lymphocytic leukemia</field><field name="subject">B Cells</field><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strangers in a Strange Land: The 1868 Aborigines and other Indigenous Performers in Mid-Victorian Britain</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">Enshrined by cricket history, the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England has become popularly established as a uniquely benign public transaction in the history of contact between Aborigines, pastoralist settlers and British colonialism. Embraced by two Australian Prime Ministers and celebrated by a commemorative Aboriginal tour, film documentaries, museum displays, poetry, creative fiction, sporting histories, special edition prints and a national advertising campaign for the centenary of Australian federation, the zeal for commemoration has overwhelmed critical enquiry. Incorporating some critical interpretations of the tour which are current in Aboriginal discourse, this re-examination subjects the tour to approaches commonly applied to other aspects of Aboriginal history and relations between colonialism and indigenous peoples. Although it is misleadingly understood simply as a cricket tour, the primitivist displays of Aboriginal weaponry during the 1868 Aboriginal tour of Britain were more appealing to spectators than their cricketing displays. Viewed solely within the prism of sport or against policies leading to extermination, dispersal and segregation of Aborigines, there is little basis for comparative analysis of the tour. But when it is considered in the context of displays of race and commodified exhibitions of primitive peoples and cultures, particularly those taken from peripheries to the centre of empire, it is no longer unique or inexplicable either as a form of cultural display, a set of inter-racial relations, or a complex of indigenous problems and opportunities. This study re-examines the tour as a part of European racial ideology and established practices of bringing exotic races to Britain for sporting, scientific and popular forms of display. It considers the options and actions of the Aboriginal performers in the light of power relations between colonial settlers and dispossessed indigenous peoples. Their lives are examined as a specific form of indentured labour subjected to time discipline, racial expectations of white audiences and managerial control by enterpreneuurs seeking to profit from the novelty of Aborigines in Britain. Comparative studies of Maori and Native American performers taken to Britain in the mid&#172;Victorian era flesh out sparse documentation of the Aboriginal experience in an alien environment. Elements of James Scott's methodology of hidden and public transcripts are utilised to identify the sources of concealed tensions and discontents. A detailed study of the two best known 1868 tourists, Dick-a-Dick and Johnny Mullagh, considers two strategies by which Aborigines confronted by a situation of acute disadvantage used their developed performance skills and knowledge of European racial preconceptions in partially successful attempts to satisfy their emotional and material needs and further Aboriginal goals. Finally, the disjunctions between commemoration and critical history are resolved by suggesting that the 1868 tour and its performers deserve to be commemorated as pioneers in the practice of recontextualisng and popularising Aboriginal culture in the western metropolis.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">19th Century</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and Teaching Mathematics: Interpreting Student Teachers' Voices</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This research study has investigated the beliefs that prospective primary school teachers hold about the epistemology of mathematics, and the teaching and learning of mathematics. In particular, it considered the following questions: *       What beliefs and attitudes about mathematics and mathematics education do first year primary school student teachers bring into their tertiary education? *       Are any of the students' beliefs about mathematics and mathematics education similar to the beliefs of the teacher educators in mathematics education and how do students interact with first year mathematics education subjects in the teacher education course? *       How do students' attitudes and beliefs influence their success in learning new mathematics at this stage of their lives? *       How do students' beliefs and attitudes affect their ideas on good practice in the teaching of mathematics in the primary school? The research design was qualitative, using a case study investigation of 50 students in their first year of a teacher education course. The students' passage through the first year mathematics education subjects provided valuable insights into their beliefs, principally by means of interviews and open-ended questionnaires. The study was designed to have pedagogical outcomes for the students, by embedding the collection and interpretation of data in the teaching and learning of their course. My personal perspective throughout this research has been that mathematics is a socio&#172;cultural phenomenon, and that the learning of mathematics is achieved through the mediation of language, social interaction and culture. This perspective of mathematics and the learning of mathematics has influenced the choice of methodology and the research questions asked. Results indicated that students often held two or more philosophies of mathematics and moved between these philosophies, depending on context. Further, students generally considered that the characteristics of a good teacher included being supportive and enthusiastic. Good pedagogy was believed to incorporate practical activities demonstrating relevance, and providing 'fun' for pupils. However, an alarming result was that having higher order knowledge about mathematics was often seen by the students as being a disadvantage for a teacher, principally because students believed such teachers would be less empathetic to struggling pupils. These beliefs affected students' interactions with the first year university mathematics education subjects, as their beliefs about the importance of subject matter knowledge were at variance with the beliefs of the teacher educators. This dissonance led to devaluing of the mathematics education subjects by some of the students. The study has led to the conclusion that a number of the students' beliefs about mathematics, and the teaching and learning of mathematics, should not be left unchallenged. Those beliefs dealing with ideas on good pedagogy should be strengthened, while beliefs about the nature of mathematics and the value of subject matter knowledge should be made more transparent and addressed. On the other side of the coin, teacher educators need to acknowledge the differences in the beliefs that student teachers and teacher educators might hold, and to consider ways of making mathematics education courses more relevant and meaningful for students.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Study and Teaching (Primary)</field><field name="subject">Mathematics Teachers Training</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the supergene geochemistry of copper, nickel and bismuth</field><field name="creator">Clissold, Meagan E.</field><field name="description">The solution geochemical conditions associated with the development of supergene copper mineralisation in the E22, E26 and E27 deposits at Northparkes, New South Wales, have been explored. Determination of a stability constant for sampleite [NaCaCu5(PO4)4Cl&#183;5H2O], a conspicuous species in the upper oxidised zone of E26, has led to an understanding of the differences between the three deposits in terms of the influence of groundwater geochemistry on their mineralogical diversity. Modelling of copper dispersion from the three deposits using current ground water compositions as proxies for past solution conditions has shown that the elevated chloride concentrations associated with E26 have negligible influence on total dissolved copper concentrations over a wide pH range. The results are discussed with respect to applications in exploration geochemistry for the discovery of new ore deposits in the region. Determination of a stability constant for lavendulan [NaCaCu5(AsO4)4Cl&#183;5H2O], the arsenate isomorph of sampleite, suggests that solid solution between lavendulan and sampleite is likely to be extensive and this has been established by reference to mineral compositions from a number of deposits. Activity-activity phase diagrams have been developed to explain the common mineral associates of lavendulan and differences between the analogous phosphate and arsenate systems. With respect to the occurrence of lavendulan in the oxidised zone of the Widgiemooltha 132 N ore body, Western Australia, its crystal chemistry explains why Ni does not substitute for Cu in the lattice. This is despite Ni being abundantly available in the deposit and substituting freely into other copper-based minerals. The substitution of Ni for Cu was explored in a study of supposedly Ni-rich paratacamite, Cu2Cl(OH)3, from the deposit. It transpires that much of this is a new mineral, gillardite, Cu3NiCl(OH)6, the isomorph of herbertsmithite, Cu3ZnCl(OH)6. The nature of gillardite was thoroughly investigated and the mineral was approved as a new species by the International Mineralogical Association. A high resolution single-crystal X-ray structure of gillardite has been completed. In addition, the substitution of Ni in simple carbonate lattices has been explored as gasp&#233;ite, NiCO3, Ni-rich magnesite, MgCO3, and calcite, CaCO3, are all common species in the oxidised zone of the Widgiemooltha 132 N deposit. Attention was subsequently focussed on the geochemistry of the element Bi, with special reference to deposits of the Kingsgate region, New South Wales. This study has led to a modern assessment of the Mo-Bi deposits in the area and new Bi sulfosalts from the Wolfram pipe at Kingsgate are described. A survey of secondary Bi minerals from a host of deposits has led to the development of a model for the dispersion of Bi in the supergene environment, which will have widespread applications in exploration geochemistry where Bi is used as a pathfinder element. Calculations of aqueous Bi species in equilibrium with bismite, Bi2O3, bismoclite, BiOCl, and bismutite, Bi2O2CO3, over a wide pH range show that the element is very insoluble under ambient oxidising conditions. It is noted that the results of previous geochemical exploration campaigns in the region will have to be reassessed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">copper ores</field><field name="subject">nickel ores</field><field name="subject">bismuth ores</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/11433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of analytical methods for the analysis of selected &#226;-agonists, stilbenes and resorcyclic acid lactones in biological matrices</field><field name="creator">Lau, Joseph Hon-Wai</field><field name="description">An analytical method was developed for the determination of the &#226;-agonists clenbuterol, cimaterol and salbutamol in bovine retina.

In particular, this thesis reports on the outcome of field surveys and glasshouse assays undertaken to locate P. cinnamomi suppressive soils and to confirm the involvement of biological processes in suppression. The potential role of cellulase and laminarinase in suppression was investigated and a molecular technique known as length heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR) was used to analyse the structure and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities in avocado orchard soils that were suppressive and conducive to P. cinnamomi. Four avocado orchards with P. cinnamomi suppressive soils were identified and soils were &#227;-irradiated to destroy their suppressive capacity, thus confirming biological suppression. Suppression was also partially transferred to &#227;-irradiated and conducive soils by mixing with 10% suppressive avocado soils. Cellulase and laminarinase activities measured in avocado orchard soils inoculated with P. cinnamomi were not associated with disease severity in lupin seedlings during glasshouse assays involving the same soil samples. Minor shifts in bacterial and fungal community structure were observed in response to mixing conducive and irradiated soils with suppressive soils. This was associated with decreased disease severity in avocado seedlings in these treatments. The shift in bacterial community structure was partially determined by the appearance and increased abundance of several bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, which were unique to the suppressive soils, in the mixed soil treatments. It is suggested that the bacteria and fungi from which these sequences originated may be involved in suppression and further work should be undertaken to determine their identity and confirm their potential role in the development and maintenance of P. cinnamomi suppressive soils.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytophthora cinnamomi control</field><field name="subject">suppressive soils</field><field name="subject">avocado orchard soils</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/16038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Error analysis in Vietnamese - English translation : pedagogical implications</field><field name="creator">Na, Pham Phu Quynh</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which the typological differences between Vietnamese and English influence the process of translating authentic Vietnamese sentences into English through an error analysis of the Vietnamese-English translations by Vietnamese EFL students. It starts with the assumption that Vietnamese is a topic-prominent language and the basic structure of Vietnamese manifests a topic-comment relation, rather than a subject-predicate relation (Thompson, 1987; Dyvik, 1984; Hao, 1991; Ros&#233;n, 1998), and tries to find out whether the students are more likely to make more errors when the topic of the sentence is not identical with the grammatical subject. This study also investigates the most common types of errors Vietnamese students make when translating topic-comment structures from Vietnamese into English. The analysis focuses on the errors made when translating the dropped subject and empty elements of Vietnamese. This is important, given the fact that the grammatical subject is always required in English, but not in Vietnamese. The data was collected from 95 students of English translation classes in their first, second, third, and fourth years in the Department of English Language and Literature at the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Using an error analysis technique often adopted in studying the deviated forms produced by second language learners (James, 1998; Richards, 1974; Corder, 1974), the study constructs an error corpus in the form of a Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and classifies all the errors based on the categories they belong to (linguistic, comprehension or translational) and the kind of deviation they are (addition, omission, misordering or misselection, etc). The study establishes a taxonomy of errors, which includes three main categories: linguistic errors, comprehension errors and translation errors. The results of the study suggest a number of potential errors students are prone to making when translating the topic-comment structure of Vietnamese into English, and provides some practical guidelines for teachers, so that they can help students deal with these types of errors in Vietnamese-English translations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnamese language</field><field name="subject">translating into English</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">translating into Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">comparative linguistics</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech perception, phonological sensitivity, and articulation in early vocabulary development</field><field name="creator">Schwarz, Iris-Corinna</field><field name="description">Speech perception, articulation, and word learning are three major tiers of language development in young children, integrating perceptual and productive language abilities. Infant speech perception precedes speech production and is the basis for native language learning. By investigating the relationship between the attention to phonological detail in speech and word learning, the degree of phonological detail in the lexical representations can be inferred. This relationship can be described by two models: the vocabulary-driven and phonology-driven model. The vocabulary-driven model proposes that the structure of the lexicon influences attention to phonological detail in speech perception, and this model is consistent with the Lexical Restructuring Model. On the other hand the phonology-driven model proposes that vocabulary increases as a result of increased attention to phonological detail in speech. To infer the phonological specifications of lexical representations of words in 2&#189;- to 3-year-olds, the variables vocabulary, phonological sensitivity, language specific speech perception and articulation accuracy were tested in a longitudinal study with 60 participants. For these variables, new measures were developed, adapted, and tested. It was found that phonological sensitivity at 30 months predicted vocabulary at 33 months, but not the opposite. This supports the prediction of the phonology-driven model. However, in an augmented version of the vocabulary-driven model that included all variables, articulation at 30 months was found to predict phonological sensitivity at 33 months. These results are discussed in the light of the Lexical Restructuring Model, and the interaction of speech perception, articulation skills, and lexical representations, and suggestions for future research are offered.

Associated with the diagnosis of diabetes is the morbidity and premature mortality stemming from the complications of the disease. It was identified that approximately 50% of clients who attended a diabetes centre in an outer western metropolitan region of Sydney were not completing diabetes education. A strategy employed to overcome this was the introduction of a 2 &#189; hour group diabetes education program called the Ongoing Education System (OES), for persons with Type 2 diabetes, that enabled completion of education at this one session. However, debate occurred among health professionals at the Wentworth Diabetes Service (WDS) as to the effectiveness of the OES as compared to the traditional individual education sessions. (one-on-one education). The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of two modes of diabetes education for completing education for clients with Type 2 diabetes , namely individual education (Treatment A) and the OES group education (Treatment B). The findings overall revealed no difference in the outcomes of participants who received individual education and those who received the OES at completion of education as well as at 6 and 12 month post education. A secondary finding of this study was the significant influence gender and age exerted on the outcomes of the education programs. One significant implication from the findings for both the person diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and the health care organisation is that the OES provides a cost effective alternative to individual education that encourages clients to complete diabetes education thereby enabling the person to achieve an optimal quality of life. In addition this study provides research evidence for the benefit of current practice in diabetes education.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">patient education</field><field name="subject">preventative health services</field><field name="subject">non-insulin-dependent diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of microcredit on poverty and women's empowerment : a case study of Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Sayma</field><field name="description">The microcredit program in Bangladesh is a unique innovation of credit delivery designed to enhance the income generating activities of the poor. Its uniqueness is reflected in its collateral-free group-based lending strategy. The program extends small loans to poor people, mainly women, for self-employment activities thus allowing clients to achieve a better quality of life. This program is regarded as a very exciting anti-poverty tool for the poorest, especially for women. This study investigates the impact of microcredit on economic indicators as well as consumption behaviour of the borrowers. It further analyses the impact of microcredit on women&#8217;s empowerment. Primary data has been collected from the borrowers of two major microcredit institutions in Bangladesh. Alongside the borrowers, data have also been collected from non-borrowers of the same village to compare the impact between borrowers and control group. The empirical work has used sophisticated econometric techniques. Five different econometric methods - OLS, 2SLS, Probit, Tobit and SURE estimators - have been applied to the sample data of this study. The most important finding indicates that microcredit programs are effective in increasing borrowers&#8217; income, assets and consumption but it is more pronounced towards high income borrowers than low income borrowers. It further finds that microcredit programs are empowering for women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfinance</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/36990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying Organisation-Public Relationships</field><field name="creator">Hawkins, David Richard</field><field name="description">To date, limited means of accurately measuring the communal organisational public relationships between an organisation and its various publics have been developed.  Researchers and practitioners have acknowledged the need for a more accurate measurement tool.  Previous analysis of communal relationships has typically been done in an anecdotal or non-quantifiable way.  This study explores a new method of quantifying the relationship between an organisation and its publics and identifies the key themes and components that are important to a successful organisation-public relationship (OPR); this method allows organisations to more accurately measure their OPRs, diagnose their strengths and weaknesses and quantify changes in the relationships over time.  In so doing, organisations will be able to improve their relationships with their stakeholders and work more effectively to achieve mutually beneficial goals.      The study's findings contribute to defining the components that can be used to develop a tool that can be used by the public relations profession to more accurately reflect the status of communal relationships, and, perhaps more importantly, the changes in the status of the relationships over time.  Increased objectivity in reflecting the status of the relationships between an organisation and its publics is likely to enable the profession to elevate its perceived status by providing a better service to organisations and their publics.  This, in turn, will allow senior management teams to see clearly the value that public relations can provide to maximise the success of the organisation.      The data obtained from this research provide insights into the priorities and expectations that external stakeholder groups have of organisations and how these expectations can be grouped into three key areas - how they are treated, the value that the relationships represent to them and how effective the communication is.  The results provide practitioners with a valuable insight into ways of improving these OPRs, which in turn could assist organisations in achieving their goals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public relations</field><field name="subject">organisation-public relationships</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">honesty</field><field name="subject">value</field><field name="subject">measurement of relationship</field><field name="subject">PR measurement</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">relationship management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090320.112940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iterative issues of ICA, quality of separation and number of   sources: a study for biosignal applications</field><field name="creator">Naik, Ganesh Ramachandra</field><field name="description">This thesis has evaluated the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on Surface Electromyography (sEMG), focusing on the biosignal applications. This research has identified and addressed the following four issues related to the use of ICA for biosignals:      &#149;	The iterative nature of ICA   &#149;	The order and magnitude ambiguity problems of ICA   &#149;	Estimation of number of sources based on dependency and independency nature of the signals   &#149;	Source separation for non-quadratic ICA (undercomplete and overcomplete)      This research first establishes the applicability of ICA for sEMG and also identifies the shortcomings related to order and magnitude ambiguity. It has then developed, a mitigation strategy for these issues by using a single unmixing matrix and neural network weight matrix corresponding to the specific user. The research reports experimental verification of the technique and also the investigation of the impact of inter-subject and inter-experimental variations. The results demonstrate that while using sEMG without separation gives only 60% accuracy, and sEMG separated using traditional ICA gives an accuracy of 65%, this approach gives an accuracy of 99% for the same experimental data. Besides the marked improvement in accuracy, the other advantages of such a system are that it is suitable for real time operations and is easy to train by a lay user.      The second part of this thesis reports research conducted to evaluate the use of ICA for the separation of bioelectric signals when the number of active sources may not be known. The work proposes the use of value of the determinant of the Global matrix generated using sparse sub band ICA for identifying the number of active sources. The results indicate that the technique is successful in identifying the number of active muscles for complex hand gestures. The results support the applications such as human computer interface.      This thesis has also developed a method of determining the number of independent sources in a given mixture and has also demonstrated that using this information, it is possible to separate the signals in an undercomplete situation and reduce the redundancy in the data using standard ICA methods. The experimental verification has demonstrated that the quality of separation using this method is better than other techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and selective PCA. This has number of applications such as audio separation and sensor networks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Independent Component Analysis (ICA)</field><field name="subject">Surface Electromyography (sEMG)</field><field name="subject">Blind Source Separation (BSS)</field><field name="subject">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</field><field name="subject">Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAP)</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090320.115103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Game analysis in Rugby Union</field><field name="creator">Agnew, Marcus</field><field name="description">Due to rugby's increasing level of professionalism, rugby union performance analysis is in a rapid state of evolution. Coaches, media, administrators and players are demanding greater access to more detailed analysis of team and player performance. Owing to the dynamic nature of the game and high frequency of events, nobody can adequately recall all aspects of the game; therefore performance analysts are playing an increasingly important role in rugby. The ability of analysts to meet this demand is being enhanced by technological advancements world wide, including the integrated capabilities of digital video, computer systems and video analysis software. Most analyses are conducted post-match by reviewing video footage and coding events of interest. Sound methodological approaches exist to develop performance indicators, which, if appropriately collated, can be used to create performance profiles indicative of player and/or team abilities. Sufficient data should be collected to ensure valid profiles, which can then be compared against population norms for more objective interpretation. Rugby research has focused on a range of performance indicators related to game structures and tactical aspects, including lineout tactics, differences between winning and losing performances, which side of the field try scoring predominates, and the number of passes per try. Research has included analysis of the world's top teams to assess the effect of law changes on the game and rates of foul play across different competitions. Despite the range of detailed analysis in the literature, there is a need for a structured account of all logical units of play, defined and quantified in accordance with coaching language and concepts. Player interactions, and off the ball player formations, also present future research potential.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">IT and sport analysis</field><field name="subject">Information technology and sport</field><field name="subject">Game coding</field><field name="subject">Synthesis of game structure in rugby</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MICE and local economic development in New Zealand: defining a role for the web</field><field name="creator">Lau, Kam Hong Chloe</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the World Wide Web (Web), can contribute to the role that Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Conventions, and Exhibitions (MICE) properties play in local economic development (LED).

The topic is studied in-depth from the organisational perspective and delves into the differing motivations of hotel operators towards shaping favourable image as well as examining how the hotel's image affects customer loyalty and helps the company to increase its competitiveness. Finally, it analyses and compares which public relations tools are the most effective in the process of image creation and developing customer loyalty. From this perspective image becomes a central issue impacting company's future growth, performance and finally success. The research was conducted on the Auckland international hotel chains. Auckland hosts numerous conferences and events that drives demand for accommodation and in a way, creates a conducive environment to hotel operators for future expansion. Thus, hotels compete strongly with one another constantly looking for a competitive advantage by growing their customer base. My thesis outlines the hotels' management efforts and analyses their strategies in the context of changing customers' demands and market trends.With respect to methodological issues, my thesis is based on a qualitative approach and follows an interpretivist paradigm. The research background has been delineated as have been my respondents' profile to provide additional information about the organisation they represent. The research findings described at the end of this thesis document how important image is for a modern hotel and what initiatives should be followed to ensure success. Image and loyalty are closely interrelated as positive image affects customers' loyalty. In order to achieve a balance between sustaining a competitive advantage and increasing loyal customer base a number of managerial implications have been discovered. Detailed analysis of these findings may help the companies to establish a more favourable position in the global market and create mutually beneficial relationships which further help the organisation to grow.Having aimed at exploring the importance of image as a medium that affects company's competitiveness and customers' loyalty towards brand, this study has provided some useful indications for hotel companies as to what should be undertaken to gain loyal customers and improve company's performance on the market.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Loyalty</field><field name="subject">Brand</field><field name="subject">Auckland hotel industry</field><field name="subject">Business competitiveness/competition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating suitable pitch sizes for young football players in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gerdsen, Willy</field><field name="description">Whilst smaller pitches have become the norm in junior football, they may still be too large for certain ages and levels of skill. To date there has been no research into the relationships between size of the pitch and the technical kicking ability (distance and accuracy) of young players (8 - 14 years of age). The purpose of this investigation was to examine variables that influence actual kicking distance and accuracy and also to measure what differences in play behaviour (passing and dribbling) emerge from self-selected changes in pitch size for different age groups (9 and 10 years of age). Data were collected on 120 (N=120) junior football players: Playing experience (M=2.85 years, SD=2.56), Height (M=1.44 m, SD=1.08), Weight (M=37.8 kg, SD=7.69), Lengths of lower limbs (knee/ankle: M=35.54 cm, SD=4.27; hip/knee: M=35.54 cm, SD=5.25), Step lengths (M=37.66 cm, SD=8.693), Estimated kicking distance (M=31.13 m, SD=16.63). Participants performed a series of three kicks along the ground, using the inside of the foot, and aiming for a target (25 m away). The distance (M=18.04 m; SD=6.56) and accuracy (M=8.32 m; SD=4.38) of each kick were measured. The children (9 and 10 years of age) were then assigned to teams and asked to construct a small-sided game on two different pitch sizes. The first pitch size used was the recommended regulation size. The second pitch size was self-selected by the players. Any changes to the playing dimensions (e.g., width of the pitch) and playing behaviours (e.g., total number of passes, dribbling) were measured and analysed. Kicking distance is best predicted by the player&#8217;s height (20.0%, P &lt; 0.000), or a combination of the player&#8217;s height and estimated kicking distance (30.0%, P = 0.002). Kicking accuracy can be attributed to the influence of the player&#8217;s step lengths (8.1%, P = 0.016) and both their step lengths and estimated kicking distance (15.1%, P = 0.020). Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the increase in pitch size (18.5% and 25%) resulted in a greater amount of dribbling (63% and 33%) and passing (12%). In general, our results support the idea that young children in New Zealand should be playing on a pitch and at a skill level which matches their football abilities. Grouping young players on a pitch according to their physical (e.g., height) and technical kicking ability (e.g., distance, accuracy) instead of their chronological age, seems to be the key factor to any other set of proposals. The findings of this thesis have important messages that could enhance the effectiveness of coaching, competitive game-play (pitch sizes) and consequently performance at all junior levels of football in New Zealand. Further research should manipulate the number of players per team to see if this factor affects competitive game-play in junior football. Additionally, the mean distances maintained between players in the same team (team-mates) during game play needs to be considered (with regard to the &#8216;beehive effect&#8217;). Further studies should examine different age groups of equivalent skill level and assess their performance in relation to their technical kicking ability on different pitches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soccer field size</field><field name="subject">Pitch dimensions</field><field name="subject">Children's sports</field><field name="subject">Sports skills acquisition</field><field name="subject">Quasi-experiemental method</field><field name="subject">Methods of association and difference</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immigrant medical practitioners&#8217; experience of seeking New Zealand registration: a participatory study</field><field name="creator">Mpofu, Charles</field><field name="description">This qualitative modified participatory study underpinned by social critical theory explored the experiences of immigrant medical practitioners seeking registration in New Zealand. The occupational science notions of occupation, occupational deprivation and occupational apartheid were used to understand the experiences of the participants. The objective of the study was to understand the experiences of the participants and facilitate their self-empowerment through facilitated dialogue, affording them opportunities for collective action. Data was obtained through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with eighteen immigrant medical practitioners who were doctors and dentists as well as two physiotherapists. The two physiotherapists were sampled out of necessity to explore diversity in findings. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. This method included the processes of coding data into themes and then collapsing themes into major themes which were organised under categories. Four categories were created in the findings describing the experiences of immigrant practitioners and suggesting solutions. Firstly; findings revealed that immigrant medical practitioners had a potential worth being utilised in New Zealand. Secondly; it was found that these participants faced negative and disabling experiences in the process of being registered. Thirdly; the emotional consequences of the negative experiences were described in the study. Fourthly; there were collectively suggested solutions where the participants felt that their problems could be alleviated by support systems modelled in other Western English speaking countries that have hosted high numbers of immigrant medical practitioners from non-English speaking countries. This collective action was consistent with the emancipatory intent of participatory research informed by social critical theory. This study resulted in drawing conclusions about the implications of the participants&#8217; experiences to well-being, occupational satisfaction as well as diverse workforce development initiatives. This study is also significant in policy making as it spelt out the specific problems faced by participants and made recommendations on what can be done to effectively utilise and benefit from the skills of immigrant medical practitioners. A multi-agency approach involving key stakeholders from the government departments, regulatory authorities, medical schools and immigrant practitioners themselves is suggested as a possible approach to solving the problems faced by these practitioners.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Overseas-trained  doctors</field><field name="subject">Diverse health workforce</field><field name="subject">Occupational  deprivation</field><field name="subject">Prejudice</field><field name="subject">Medical accreditation and licensing</field><field name="subject">Professional regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved efficiencies in flame weeding</field><field name="creator">de Rooy, S.

The Hoffmann burner initially used in the Lincoln University flame weeder was found not to entrain sufficient air to allow complete combustion of the LPG used.  A new burner, the Modified Lincoln University burner, was designed to improve the entrainment of air. Results show that the new design entrained sufficient air to theoretically allow complete combustion of the LPG, and this resulted in a 22.7% increase in heat output per Kg of LPG used over the Hoffmann burner.  Temperature x time exposure constants required to kill weeds 0 - 15, 15 - 30, and 30 - 45 mm in size, were found to be respectively 750, 882, and 989 degrees Celsius.Seconds. These constants can be used to calculate the maximum speed of travel an operator can use a flame weeder at, once the temperature profile underneath its shields are established at various travel speeds, and therefore ensure that the flame weeder is used at its maximum efficiency. The constants can also be used to establish the cost efficiency of any flame weeder (in $/Ha), depending on the size of the weeds to be treated.  The materials and methods used in establishing the temperature x time exposure constants can be used to establish the temperature x time exposure constant of any weed species at any size.</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">weed control</field><field name="subject">flame weeding</field><field name="subject">pre-emergence flaming</field><field name="subject">air entrainment</field><field name="subject">complete combustion</field><field name="subject">incomplete combustion</field><field name="subject">perfect combustion</field><field name="subject">burning velocity</field><field name="subject">bluff bodies</field><field name="subject">blow off</field><field name="subject">temperature x time exposure constants</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of antioxidants in the hydrogen peroxide-induced opacification of sheep lens</field><field name="creator">Lei, Jie</field><field name="description">The lens of the eye needs to be transparent with a high refractive index to focus images on the retina. In cataracts the lens becomes opaque, eventually leading to blindness. There are many possible causes of cataract but a lot of evidence implicates oxidative damage as contributing to opacification. This includes epidemiological studies showing that diets rich in antioxidants lowered the prevalence of cataract. This research tested the hypothesis that if cataracts were at least partially caused by oxidative damage then their progression would be slowed by application of antioxidants. The antioxidants used were two plant compounds found in the diet, resveratrol and quercetin. The system used was sheep lenses cultured in Eagles Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM). Lenses remained transparent for up to 7 days in EMEM but became opaque within 24 h when exposed to 1 mM hydrogen peroxide (H&#8322;O&#8322;). The lens is exposed to H&#8322;O&#8322; in vivo as it is found in the aqueous humor. Prior Lenses pre-treated with quercetin reduced but did not prevent opacification. Lens cell death, as determined by measurement of leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, was found to increase with H&#8322;O&#8322; and the increase was prevented by pre-treatment with antioxidants. The role of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione was also investigated. It was found that H&#8322;O&#8322; decreased the amount of reduced glutathione in the lens cortex and increased the levels of oxidised glutathione but only at levels of 2 mM and above. Thus the results of this research indicate that H&#8322;O&#8322; at low concentration (1 mM) is able to damage lens cells and cause opacification without affecting the reduced glutathione levels and that the exogenous antioxidants have some ability to protect the lens.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep lens</field><field name="subject">oxidative damage</field><field name="subject">antioxidant</field><field name="subject">quercetin</field><field name="subject">resveratrol</field><field name="subject">cataract</field><field name="subject">lactate dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">Eagles minimal essential medium</field><field name="subject">glutathione</field><field name="subject">hydrogen peroxide</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/17</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predator interactions within a trophic level : Phalangium opilio L. (Arachnida: Opiliones) and mites (Arachnida: Acari)</field><field name="creator">Merfield, C. N.</field><field name="description">This study investigated commensal feeding interactions between the European harvestman (P. opilio L.) and the predatory mites Balaustium spp. and Anystis baccarum L. It also investigated the feeding behaviour of P. opilio. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory using standardised temperature, humidity, photoperiod and experimental arenas, with eggs of the brown blowfly (Calliphora stygia F.) as prey facsimiles. Due to initial difficulties in obtaining enough predatory mites, mite feeding was manually simulated piercing blowfly eggs with a minuten pin. P. opilio consumed significantly more freeze-killed than live blowfly eggs, indicating that freezing induced chemical and/or physical changes to blowfly eggs that are detected by P. opilio. Significantly more manually pierced eggs were consumed by P. opilio compared with unpierced ones, demonstrating that piercing caused a chemical and/or physical to the egg and increased the feeding rates of P. opilio. Different densities of eggs had no effect on the numbers eaten by P. opilio and placing single pierced eggs next to groups of unpierced eggs also had no effect on the numbers of unpierced eggs eaten. These results suggest that P. opilio does not exhibit klinokinesis or orthokinesis to intensify its search for prey around the area where previous prey were located. P. opilio ate significantly more brown blowfly eggs that had previously been fed on by mites, demonstrating that a short term commensal interaction existed. However, further work is required to demonstrate if the relationship is commensal in the longer term. A comparison between hand-pierced and mite-pierced eggs showed that P. opilio ate significantly more of the former indicating that mite and hand piercing were quantitatively different. The potential for, and importance of, other commensal or mutual relationships between predators in agroecosystems is discussed. The lack of klinokinesis and orthokinesis in P. opilio is compared with other predators and parasitoids that do exhibit these behaviours. The means by which prey are detected by P. opilio are discussed in relation to interpreting behaviours such as prey inspection. Concerns about the effect of pre-treatment and handling of sentinel prey and the problems of using prey facsimiles are raised.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agroecosystem</field><field name="subject">Anystis baccarum</field><field name="subject">Balaustium spp.</field><field name="subject">Calliphora stygia</field><field name="subject">commensalism</field><field name="subject">European harvestmen</field><field name="subject">klinokinesis</field><field name="subject">orthokinesis</field><field name="subject">P. opilio</field><field name="subject">predators</field><field name="subject">prey facsimiles</field><field name="subject">sentinel prey</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of household saving in China</field><field name="creator">Huang, Peng</field><field name="description">It is a conventional wisdom that since the start of the Chinese economic reform in 1978, the domestic saving structure in China has changed significantly. Previous studies of household saving in China (for example: Qian, 1988, Feltenstein et al, 1990, and Wakabayashi and Mackellar, 1999) have usually relied upon the Keynesian absolute-income hypothesis, Duesenberry's relative-income hypothesis, and Friedman's permanent-income hypothesis. This thesis uses the Modigliani-Brumberg life-cycle hypothesis to examine the determinants of household saving behavior in the Peoples' Republic of China during the period 1978 to 2003. The research uses modern cointegration techniques to examine the impact on saving rates of economic growth, age dependency, wealth, the real interest rate, social security payments and unemployment (as a proxy for income uncertainty). Autoregressive distributed lag models are constructed and tested. The results find that economic growth, the real interest rate and social security payments have the expected effect with significant parameters; age dependency has the expected sign but in one model is not statistically significant; and that unemployment is not significant. The most surprising result is that increases in household wealth are associated with increased saving rates, which may help explain very high economic growth rates in China post 1978.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">household savings</field><field name="subject">life cycle model</field><field name="subject">Modigliani</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different places for different faces : optimising the beneficial outcomes of Christchurch parks</field><field name="creator">Hansen, K. M.</field><field name="description">Local authorities exist to promote the social, economic, environmental, and cultural wellbeing of communities. Parks provide a means of achieving this purpose. This study investigates community preferences for Christchurch parks using the Beneficial Outcomes Approach. Outcomes desired by the community are identified, together with the park settings required to achieve them. Different attitudes and preferences of three socio-economic areas are compared. Information was gathered from a household survey of 600 residents from three diverse socioeconomic areas of Christchurch selected by using the New Zealand Deprivation Index. Results show that the overwhelming majority of Christchurch residents regularly use Christchurch parks for a diverse range of activities. Parks fill many different roles associated with the activity, aesthetic and environmental values ascribed to parks by the Christchurch community. The Christchurch community perceives and wants a diverse range of personal, social/cultural, environmental, and economic benefits from parks. Differences were found between the three socio-economic areas in the way they valued and used parks. Respondents from the low socio-economic area were more inclined to use parks as a special place to visit for weekend outings and relaxation in contrast to respondents from the high socio-economic area who were more likely to use parks for daily exercise. Respondents from the medium socio-economic area had mixed use patterns. The study concludes that a city-wide network approach to park provision is required to cater for the diverse range of experiences, settings and activities preferred by the Christchurch community and to optimise the beneficial outcomes of Christchurch parks. The BOA provides a useful method of prioritising outcomes and guiding management actions to be more responsive to community needs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban parks</field><field name="subject">benefits</field><field name="subject">beneficial outcomes approach</field><field name="subject">benefits-based management</field><field name="subject">leisure constraints</field><field name="subject">park planning and management</field><field name="subject">Christchurch parks</field><field name="subject">recreation planning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genotypic evaluation of Trifolium ambiguum</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alan V.</field><field name="description">A number of morphological, floral, rhizome, root and herbage characteristics were studied in order to describe genetic variation and environmental responses in T. ambiguum. From each of six lines, 30 genotypes were clonally progagated into five diverse edaphic and altitudinal sites and grown for one season. Comparisons of growth and form were also made between T. ambiguum, T. repens cv. 'Grasslands Huia' and Lotus pedunculatus cv. 'Grasslands Maku'. The polyploid lines were found to have larger leaves than the diploids while all the lines of T. ambiguum had larger leaves than did white clover. Tetraploid lines had longer petioles and were taller and more erect than the diploids or hexaploids. Floral initiation was found to become later as ploidy level increased but the tetraploid lines exhibited a very large variation in flowering date. The cultivar Treeline was found to produce the most herbage under all conditions although not significantly more than cultivar Prairie or C.P.I. 57353. However, as nodulation was not studied it was not possible to determine whether variety differences were due to root nodulating ability or some other genetically determined parameter. None of the T. ambiguum varieties produced as much herbage as cv. Huia or cv. Maku at any site. However, all the T. ambiguum lines performed relatively better under harsher conditions. Because a large proportion of T. ambiguum was below ground the best T. ambiguum line, cultivar Treeiine, produced equivalent total plant dry weight to cv. Huia and cv. Maku at 1200 m. a.s.l., the high altitude site. Cultivar Prairie was found to have the highest proportion of rhizomes to total plant mass bu  because cv. Treeline had higher total plant dry weight both cultivars produced equivalent mean rhizome dry weight. The number of rhizomes, number of daughter plants and rhizome dry weight were all highly correlated and these three characteristics showed similar trends among varieties. Rhizome length was found to increase with ploidy level, as did rhizome internode length. However, the number of nodes was found to be higher in the diploids than in the polyploids. Cultivar Treeline was found to have a high proportion of branching nodes on its rhizomes while C.P.I. 57353 and cv. Summit had the least. Rhizome production was restricted in the Wakanui silt loam soil of high bulk density. However, herbage growth and rhizome branching was increased, probably because of the higher fertility. It was shown using factor analysis on genotypic correlations, that rhizome characteristics and herbage yields were relatively independently inherited. However, morphological characters tended to be related to herbage yields. The polyploid varieties were found to be more genetically variable than the diploids . Broad sense heritabilities were calculated for all parameters measured, and in general, morphological characteristics had higher values than agronomic characteristics. As the genetic variation within each line was higher than the variation among lines, it is apparent that selection within lines should result in the largest gains. Therefore, comparison of the mean performance of the presently highly variable lines is relatively uninformative. By sacrificing some genetic diversity, large gains could be made in performance. It is suggested that cv. Prairie be used as the basis for selecting a highly rhizomatous cultivar while cv. Treeline could be used in the selection of a cultivar with higher herbage production suitable for high country conditions. In a second trial, an established stand of cv. Treeline produced up to 13250 kg ha&#8315;&#185; for one season under good growing conditions. The management required to produce this amount of herbage was to irrigate and cut to ground level every two months. The growth rate was considerably depressed when cut monthly. It was also shown that root and rhizome yield reached 12600 kg ha&#8315;&#185;, indicating a massive reserve of assimilates, particularly useful for surviving periods of stress. Seed yields were found to be adequate, reaching levels equivalent to 500-700 kg ha&#8315;&#185;. These results were discussed in relation to earlier observations on T. ambiguum by workers in Russia, Australia, U.S.A. and New Zealand.

Four species had been recorded previously from this area; Leiolopisma maccanni Patterson and Daugherty, Leiolopisma nigriplantare polychroma Patterson and Daugherty, Leiolopisma lineoocellatum (Dumeril and Dumeril) and Hoplodactylus maculatus (Gray). Three of these species (L. maccanni, L. n. polychroma and H. maculatus) were captured during the course of the study. The aim of this present study was to examine the nature of the ecological relationship among these three species at Birdlings Flat. Capture data indicated that L. maccanni was almost entirely confined to the dunelands while L. n. polychroma was associated exclusively with shrublands on old dune ridges behind the sand dunes. H. maculatus' distribution encompassed both of these major habitats. Separation on the basis of habitat was thought to be the most important niche variable for these two diurnal skinks. There was some temporal separation in activity of these two species, with L. maccanni active earlier in the day than L. n. polychroma. However, there was a high degree of overlap in the activity periods of these two species. Temporal differentiation between the nocturnal gecko H. maculatus and the two diurnal skinks is thought to be an important means by which these species coexist. The most common prey items consumed by all three species were Diptera, Araneae, C. propinqua seeds, Hemiptera, unidentified arthropod eggs, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera. Dietary differences between the two skink species were apparent although these differences appeared to be related to the preferred habitats of the respective species. Density estimates for L. maccanni varied between 1050/ha and 1850/ha while L. n. polychroma density varied between 200/ha and 400/ha. The density of H. maculatus was not calculated but appeared to be intermediate to the density of the two skink species. The apparent disappearance of L. lineoocellatum from an area where they were once relatively common is cause for concern. There is no obvious reason for this decline although it may be related to the combined impacts of predation, collection and habitat disturbance.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="subject">geckos</field><field name="subject">skinks</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Canterbury</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of implementing customer relationship management by Chinese-owned SMEs</field><field name="creator">Lin, C. Y.</field><field name="description">In the last decade, the ever increasing pressure of competition faced by businesses has led to the development of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). In short, CRM is the practice of integrating all aspects of business functions for dealing with customers, with the assistance of technology, and with the intention of boosting company profitability. CRM has been widely promoted as a critical contributor to business survival. However, the high failure rate of CRM projects has also attracted research attention and many factors have been discussed as contributing to the success or failure of CRM implementation. This research argues that CRM is not simply a software package or a computer program. CRM, instead, should be perceived as a strategic issue in order to realize its potential. In addition, this study also argues that CRM implementation is affected by organizational, strategic and cultural factors. In particular, this study was conducted within the context of Chinese small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), with company size and culture as two major focuses in this study. SMEs were chosen as this segment has been overlooked in CRM study, yet it represents a great potential for growth in CRM adoption. Chinese culture was chosen as most of CRM studies have been conducted within a western cultural background. The Chinese culture has distinctive characteristics different from western culture, and this has strong influences on business operations. A quantitative method was adopted for this study and a mailed survey was used to collect data to examine the relevance of these factors within this context. Research participants were recruited using a systematic sampling technique through a comprehensive Chinese business directory. Results suggest that there are positive associations between a company's CRM implementation and its practice of organizational, strategic, and cultural issues. In particular, four organizational issues &#8211; organizational integration, executive commitment, system readiness, and resource availability; three strategic issues &#8211; vision, planning, and customer-centric culture; and one cultural issue &#8211; networking, have an impact on a company's CRM implementation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</field><field name="subject">Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Chinese</field><field name="subject">relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">implementation</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of the introduction, naturalisation, and spread of Trifolium species in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gravuer, Kelly</field><field name="description">Two conceptual approaches which offer promise for improved understanding of biological invasions are conceptualizing the invasion process as a series of distinct stages and explicitly incorporating human actions into analyses. This study explores the utility of these approaches for understanding the invasion of Trifolium (true clover) species in New Zealand. From the published literature, I collected a range of Trifolium species attributes, including aspects of global transport and use by humans, opportunistic association with humans in New Zealand, native range attributes, habitat characteristics, and biological traits. I also searched historical records to estimate the extent to which each species had been planted in New Zealand, a search facilitated by the enormous importance of Trifolium in New Zealand's pastoral agriculture system. Regression analysis and structural equation modelling were then used to relate these variables to success at each invasion stage. Fifty-four of the 228 species in the genus Trifolium were intentionally introduced to New Zealand. Species introduced for commercial agriculture were characterised by a large number of economic uses and presence in Britain, while species introduced for horticulture or experimental agriculture were characterised by a large native range area. Nine of these 54 intentionally introduced species subsequently naturalised in New Zealand. The species that successfully naturalised were those that had been planted extensively by humans and that were well-matched to the New Zealand climate. A further 16 species (from the pool of 174 species that were never intentionally introduced) arrived and naturalised in New Zealand without any recorded intentional aid of humans. Several attributes appeared to assist species in unintentional introduction-naturalisation, including a good match to the New Zealand climate, a large native range area, presence in human-influenced habitats, a widespread distribution in Britain, and self-pollination capability. The 25 total naturalised species varied greatly in their current distributions and in the rates at which they had spread to achieve those distributions. Species that had spread quickly and are currently more widespread had been frequent contaminants in the pasture seed supply and have a long flowering period in New Zealand. Other biological traits and native range attributes played supporting roles in the spread process. Attributes facilitating success clearly varied among invasion stages. Humans played a dominant role at all stages of this invasion, although biological traits had increasing importance as a species moved through the invasion sequence. My findings suggest that incorporation of human actions and the stage-based framework provide valuable insight into the invasion process. I discuss potential avenues by which these approaches might be integrated into predictive invasion models.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invasive</field><field name="subject">alien</field><field name="subject">exotic</field><field name="subject">introduced species</field><field name="subject">non-indigenous</field><field name="subject">plant</field><field name="subject">stage</field><field name="subject">transition</field><field name="subject">stage-specific framework</field><field name="subject">experimental trials</field><field name="subject">introduction</field><field name="subject">naturalisation</field><field name="subject">spread</field><field name="subject">Trifolium</field><field name="subject">clover</field><field name="subject">human agency</field><field name="subject">human dispersal</field><field name="subject">introduction effort</field><field name="subject">unintentional</field><field name="subject">deliberate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of pre-rigor infusion of lamb with kiwifruit juice on meat quality</field><field name="creator">Han, Jin</field><field name="description">Tenderness, juiciness, colour and flavour are the most important meat quality attributes affecting the consumer acceptance. Maintaining the consistency of meat products by avoiding variable quality has become a major concern and great challenge to the meat industry. This in turn will also benefit meat end-users in the marketplace by having more tender meat. The present study was designed to evaluate the overall effects of pre-rigor infusion with kiwifruit juice, which contains the plant protease, actinidin, on lamb quality. A total of 18 lambs (12 months old) were divided into three treatment groups (6 lambs per each treatment). After exsanguination, lamb carcasses were infused (10% body weight) with fresh kiwifruit juice (Ac), water (W) and compared with a noninfusion treatment which acted as a control (C). Samples from different muscle/cuts (longissimus dorsi (LD) vs leg chops) at different post-mortem times (1 day post-mortem vs. 3 wks vacuum packaged storage at 2&#176;C) and display time (0 to 6 days after the post-mortem storage) were analysed to monitor the changes on meat physical properties (e.g., tenderness, temperature, drip and cooking loss, colour), biochemical changes (pH, proteins and lipids) and volatile flavour compounds after the infusion treatments. The most tender meat (lowest shear force values) (P &lt; 0.001) detected in the Ac carcasses post-mortem compared with C and W carcasses demonstrated that kiwifruit juice was a very powerful meat tenderizer, and could contribute to the meat tenderization process efficiently and effectively. Compared with C and W carcasses, the enhanced proteolytic activity (P = 0.002) resulting from the actinidin in kiwifruit juice in Ac carcasses caused degradation of the myofibrillar proteins and the appearance of new peptides during postmortem ageing. A slight positive effect in a*-value (redness) and decreased lipid oxidation, found in leg chops, was thought to be caused by the natural antioxidants in kiwifruit juice. Kiwifruit juice infused into the meat did not alter (P &gt; 0.05) the volatile flavour compound profile indicating that the meat from Ac treated carcasses maintained its natural lamb flavour. No treatment differences were found for the temperature decline (P &gt; 0.05) between the infused treatments and C. The higher rate of pH decline (P &lt; 0.05) found in W carcasses might have contributed to the higher drip and cooking loss. The unbound water in meat might contribute to the higher L*-values (lightness) found in W carcasses. In summary, the proteolytic tenderizing infusion treatment using kiwifruit juice is a feasible approach for the commercial meat industry to increase profits, and also could satisfy the eating quality standards required by the consumers. In addition, tenderizing meat by using kiwifruit juice could also provide the kiwifruit processors an additional option for use of their product to gain a more profitable return.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">actinidin</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">eating quality</field><field name="subject">flavour</field><field name="subject">infusion</field><field name="subject">juiciness</field><field name="subject">kiwifruit juice</field><field name="subject">lamb</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">meat</field><field name="subject">protease</field><field name="subject">tenderness</field><field name="subject">volatile compounds</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenology of hazelnut big bud mites in Canterbury and implications for management</field><field name="creator">Webber, J. D.</field><field name="description">Eriophyoid big bud mites are key pests of hazelnuts throughout the world, although little is known of the identity and impact of the species on New Zealand hazelnut crops. The key objectives of this study were to determine the species of mite present on New Zealand crops, explore a method of monitoring mite emergence from overwintering big buds, determine the phenology of mites in relation to tree phenology and weather, and identify the optimum timing for control measures. The presence of both Phytoptus avellanae (Nalepa 1889) (Acari: Phytoptidae) and Cecidophyopsis vermiformis (Nalepa 1889) (Acari: Eriophyidae) was confirmed, the latter species being a new record for New Zealand. Preliminary diagnostic DNA sequences were determined for both species. A sticky band technique was developed to monitor mite emergence from overwintering big buds, and mite emergence was found to occur between early and late spring. Mite emergence and movement occurred when daily temperatures were greater than 15 degrees C and when mean temperatures were greater than 9 degrees C, with mite emergence increasing with temperature. It proved difficult to relate the phenology of hazelnut to mite emergence, however, the development of new buds during mite emergence was a crucial factor in the infestation of new buds. An accumulated heat sum model (DD), started at Julian date 152 and using a lower threshold temperature of 6 degrees C, predicted the onset of emergence on two cultivars and at two sites as occurring at approximately 172 DD. A regression model based on leaf number, bud height, bud width, DD and Julian date provided a more satisfactory prediction of percent accumulated mite emergence. It is recommended both peak mite emergence and the appearance of hazelnut buds should be used to optimise the time to apply control measures. Therefore, a control should be applied before buds measure 0.5 x 0.5 mm (width x height), are enclosed within the axil, and have a rounded tip, or, when 50% accumulated mite emergence has occurred, which ever occurs first. A preliminary field experiment tested the application of sulphur (40 g/10 litres of 800 g/kg No Fungus Super Sulphur) at 2, 50 and 80% accumulated mite emergence. The greatest reduction in mite numbers was achieved with an application at approximately 50% emergence. Considerable variation in mite emergence occurred between years, therefore optimum timing of controls would need to be determined by monitoring mites, new buds and weather conditions each year. Field collection of mites also identified the presence of Typhlodromus doreenae Schicha (Acari: Phytoseiidae) which would warrant further study for inclusion in an integrated mite control programme.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytoptus avellanae</field><field name="subject">Cecidophyopsis vermiformis</field><field name="subject">big bud mites</field><field name="subject">eriophyoids</field><field name="subject">Corylus avellana</field><field name="subject">hazelnut</field><field name="subject">emergence</field><field name="subject">chemical control</field><field name="subject">prediction</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">degree-days</field><field name="subject">phenology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">pest management</field><field name="subject">DNA sequences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using web services for customised data entry</field><field name="creator">Deng, Yanbo</field><field name="description">Scientific databases often need to be accessed from a variety of different applications. There are usually many ways to retrieve and analyse data already in a database. However, it can be more difficult to enter data which has originally been stored in different sources and formats (e.g. spreadsheets, other databases, statistical packages). This project focuses on investigating a generic, platform independent way to simplify the loading of databases. The proposed solution uses Web services as middleware to supply essential data management functionality such as inserting, updating, deleting and retrieval of data. These functions allow application developers to easily customise their own data entry applications according to local data sources, formats and user requirements. We implemented a Web service to support loading data to the Germinate database at the New Zealand Institute of Crop &amp; Food Research (CFR). We also provided language specific client toolkits to help developers invoke the Web service. The toolkits allow applications to be easily customised for different platforms. In addition, we developed sample applications to help end users load data from their project data sources via the Web service. The Web service approach was evaluated through user and developer trials. The feedback from the developer trial showed that using Web services as middleware is a useful approach to allow developers and competent end users to customise data entry with minimal effort. More importantly, the customised client applications enabled end users to load data directly from their project spreadsheets and databases. It significantly reduced the effort required for exporting or transforming the source data.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">data management</field><field name="subject">data loading</field><field name="subject">web services</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280103 Information storage, retrieval and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of home ranges, movements, diet and habitat use of kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) in the southeastern sector of Banks Peninsula, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Kirsten L.</field><field name="description">The present study is part of the Kaupapa Kereru Programme. The main aim of the programme is to increase the numbers and range of kereru (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) on Banks Peninsula. Home ranges, movements, diet and habitat use of 15 kereru captured in Hinewai Reserve, Banks Peninsula, were investigated from February 2005 to February 2006. Hinewai Reserve is the largest tract of regenerating native forest in a highly modified urban-rural landscape. Phenology of 11 plant species predicted to be key kereru foods, was studied to determine the pattern of food availability in Hinewai Reserve. Twelve radio-tagged kereru resided in the Hinewai Reserve study site (Otanerito Valley and Sleepy Bay) and three resided in Akaroa. Ripe fruit was available from January to August; the height of the fruiting season was in autumn. The bulk of new leaf growth occurred in spring and early summer although new leaves were available on broom and tree lucerne year round. Peak flowering occurred in spring. Kereru in Akaroa ate a total of 21 plant species; six of these species were native and 15 introduced. Kereru in the Hinewai Reserve study site ate a total of 26 plant species; 20 of these species were native and six introduced. Fruit was preferred when readily available. Native fruit appeared to be preferred over fruit of introduced species in Akaroa, where both types were available. New foliage of introduced legumes and deciduous species appeared to be preferred over new foliage of native species at both sites during winter and spring. These species were important food sources prior to the breeding season and may be selected specifically for their nitrogen and protein content. Food is currently not a limiting factor for kereru survival or reproductive success. Considerable variation in the use and preference of vegetation types of individual kereru made it difficult to identify trends in habitat selection. Use and preference for many vegetation types was seasonal; this was certainly because of the availability of food species included in or close to these vegetation types. Overall, native vegetation communities were used more than communities dominated by introduced species and forest communities were used more than non-forest communities. Kanuka (Kunzea ericoides) was used most often for non-feeding activities and 67% of observed nests were built in kanuka. Annual home ranges and core areas in the Hinewai Reserve study site (mean of 15.9 and 2 ha respectively) were significantly larger than those found in Lyttelton Harbour, Banks Peninsula in previous research (mean of 8 and 0.08 ha respectively). Home ranges were larger when fruit was eaten, than when no fruit was eaten indicating that kereru are more sedentary when feeding on foliage.  Kereru from the Hinewai Reserve study site made no excursions &gt;5 km and no daily movements &gt;2 km. Kereru from Akaroa and Sleepy Bay travelled into Otanerito Valley to feed on horopito in autumn, indicating that there may have been a lack of fruit in their local areas during autumn. No kereru in Otanerito Valley travelled outside of the valley. The distribution of high quality food sources is likely to have caused the observed differences in home range and core area size between localities. Kereru in Lyttelton Harbour may have been restricted to small patches of high quality resources in a study area consisting largely of unsuitable habitat. In Hinewai Reserve, high quality resources were spread over larger areas and were more uniformly distributed. The density of kereru was unknown at both study sites, and this confounded assessment of habitat quality. However, it is likely that the Hinewai Reserve study site would support a higher number of kereru. The main factor limiting population growth in the present study was failure of nests at the egg and chick stage. The fledge rate was 17%. Two of fifteen adult kereru died. Control of predators should be the first aspect of management that is focused on, and will almost certainly increase reproductive success of kereru and loss of breeding adults. As the population of kereru on Banks Peninsula increases due to predator control in existing kereru habitat, food may become a limiting factor. Habitat can be improved for kereru by planting a diverse range of plant species that provide food year-round.  Native fruiting species are greatly recommended for habitat enhancement and should be selected so that fruit is available for as much of the year as possible. Native and introduced legumes should also be made available as foods for winter and spring. As most land on Banks Peninsula is privately owned, co-operation and enthusiasm of the community is critical for successful management. Information and support needs to be given to landowners wishing to enhance their properties for kereru.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kereru</field><field name="subject">New Zealand pigeon</field><field name="subject">Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae</field><field name="subject">Banks Peninsula</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The operation and effectiveness of formal and informal supply chains for fresh produce in the Papua New Guinea highlands</field><field name="creator">Worinu, Mark</field><field name="description">The research aim was to gain a more detailed understanding of the operation of different key segments for fresh produce supply chains originating in the Highlands Provinces in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The research investigates a number of supply chain dimensions of effectiveness which include, value creation and integration of processes, logistics, quality, information, relationship/vertical integration and overall effectiveness. These were linked together in SC framework. Two potato chains were investigated, one formal, the other informal. The informal potato chain involves small holder farmers, input suppliers and local markets including kai bars and the urban market. The chain originates and ends within the Western Highlands Province. The formal potato chain has farmers, input suppliers, wholesaler/marker, transport companies (trucking and coastal shipping agents), supermarkets, hotels and kai bars. This chain originates in Mt Hagen, Western Highlands Province and ends in Port Moresby, National Capital District. The effectiveness of both the formal and informal chains was identified, and comparisons were made to see how each chain differed. The informal chain was found to have different problems to the formal chains. However, participants to both chains demonstrate a high entrepreneurial behavior. A key finding of the study was that the chains spread their risk by operating in multiple market segments and this can help to solve issues with variable quality. The marketers in each chain position themselves in these different market segments. It was clear from this work that focusing on functions and not the whole chain can lead to a distorted view of chain performance. For example, for the informal chain, a focus on logistics issues, particularly poor roads and problems with availability of seeds, can misrepresent the effectiveness of this chain. Therefore, it was concluded that it is important to look at the overall performance of each chain rather than looking specifically at particular chain functions in isolation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">supply chain management</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea supply chains</field><field name="subject">formal chains</field><field name="subject">informal chains</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">smallholder farmer</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Senior management's influence on the contextual components of an organisation that affect creativity : a case study of a New Zealand manufacturing company</field><field name="creator">Rangiaho, Melina</field><field name="description">Organisations are under enormous pressure to become more innovative in all areas of their operations if they are going to continue to compete successfully (Leavy, 2003). The first stage of successful innovation is ensuring that creativity, the generation of novel ideas, is achieved (McFadzean, et al., 2004). With regards to an organisation's creative environment, theory has suggested that the basic orientation of a company's support for creativity comes directly from the behaviours of the highest levels of management (Amabile, 1996). Despite this proposed relationship, little empirical research has been conducted that examines the role that senior management of an organisation play in influencing a work environment that stimulates creativity. A research model has been developed that illustrates the possible relationships between the functions of senior managers and the creative work environment of an organisation. Essentially this model is be utilised as a framework to examine how do the management functions create the stimulants and impediments of an organisation's environment that affect creativity? The method used to investigate this research question is a qualitative investigation of two manufacturing plants that operate in a larger New Zealand food processing company. This entailed gathering information through semi-structured interviews with employees from the senior management to lower level employees. In addition, direct observations at the plants and archival data in the form of company reports, articles and prior studies were used to gather further information. From this research, three key findings were established. (1) Amabile, et al's., (1996) theory that a number of variables stimulate creativity, while others impede it, was supported. (2) Trust was found to be the key intervening variable, the foundation, upon which a creative context can be built. (3) The Senior Manager, in the case of this research the Operations Manager and Production Centre Manager, played a crucial role in providing the contextual variables that facilitate creativity. As this research suggests, organisational creativity is complicated by the fact that it is affected by the social dynamics operating between key parties within an organisation. Consequently, it is characterised by informal relationships, freedom and resource allocation that ultimately requires that a level of trust exists between key parties. It is senior management's responsibility to ensure that such a work environment is created. These managers are only able to build trust within their organisations by acting with benevolence, integrity and demonstrating that they are committed to employee creativity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">organisational environment</field><field name="subject">management functions</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Options for developing a new mid micron value proposition for consumers</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Ana</field><field name="description">The research for this thesis "Options for Developing a New Mid Micron Value Proposition for Consumers", is a part of a larger "New Mid Micron Products" project initiated by Mid Micron New Zealand Inc with the key goal of turning the Mid Micron Sector into a more vibrant and profitable one. The motivation for the project can be found in the dramatic fall in demand for New Zealand Mid Micron wool over the past decade. Two dominant causes for the fall in demand for Mid Micron wool were identified: the substandard skin comfort of final products made from Mid Micron wool, and a problem with the structure of the Mid Micron Sector. These problems are addressed in the "New Mid Micron Products" project that combines new product development and new marketing initiatives. Product development involved the use of new spinning technology to improve skin comfort quality and develop new products that are softer and prickle free. The aim is to extract more value for woolgrowers by having the wool converted into a higher value product. The new marketing initiatives, which were identified in this thesis research, Focusing On New Market Segments via E-Commerce and Reconfiguring The Value Chain, and concentrate on the operational issues of capturing the value from the newly developed Mid Micron products. Taking into account the nature of the overall Mid Micron Project and type of developed products, this research identified the Operational Excellence and Product Leadership models as alternative routes to develop a new Mid Micron Value Proposition for consumers. Operational Excellence, and the associated Cost Leadership strategy, is a low capital investment option, while Product Leadership and the associated Differentiation strategy is a high capital investment option. The models' principles and their elements, products, price and delivery to market, are evaluated in the context of the Mid Micron Business.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mid micron wool</field><field name="subject">value proposition for consumers</field><field name="subject">operational excellence</field><field name="subject">product leadership</field><field name="subject">customer intimacy</field><field name="subject">supply value chain</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The theoretical relevance of an updated Marxian theory of commodity in economics</field><field name="creator">Ahumada, P. E.</field><field name="description">How does material production become socially recognised in capitalism? This is a fundamental question to be addressed in capitalist production, since material production takes place privately and independently in a global and atomistic system. This thesis shows that the question is tackled by Marx in the first three chapters of Capital. The process of social recognition of material production is that of the realisation of work carried out privately and independently as part of the social labour. For Marx this occurs through the private and independent work becoming objective social labour as the substance of the value of commodities, and through the latter finding its necessary developed mercantile expression in the price form of commodities. Therefore, private and independent work becomes social labour through the recognition of its product as equivalent to a certain amount of money. The thesis argues that Marx's answer is powerfully insightful but flawed because it did not succeed in fully characterising the historical specificity of commodity. Commodity is not merely the differentiated unity of use value and value but of use value and mercantile use value, and of labour value and mercantile value. The former dialectic is immediate and distinguishes between the utility of commodity as a direct means of consumption or production and that as a means of exchange, fully determining the behaviour of the private and independent commodity producer. The latter dialectic is objective and distinguishes between commodity as the embodiment of the social labour necessary to reproduce it and as the embodiment of command over social labour, enabling the adjustment of the productive structure. Both dialectics are mediated by the mercantile form of value, which allows the indirect expression of labour value as the gravitational force of the system. The theory of commodity offered in this thesis, unlike that of Marx, consistently hinges on the atomistic private and independent commodity producer. The thesis shows that commodity production is the organisation of society's labour for its material reproduction, just as in any previous mode of production. The discovery of the generic aspect of commodity production breaks the false immediate link between production and supply, and that between the labour theory of value and both the supply-side-determined theory of price and the single-factor theory of production. The thesis also shows that the mercantile form of value is what allows society's labour to become an objective and autonomous materially abstract substance regulating the adjustment of the productive system under the form of material signals. This is the specific aspect of a global mode of production comprised of free and independent individuals. The mercantile form of value is thus Adam Smith's invisible hand. Finally, the thesis analyses some implications of the framework with regard to the analysis of monetary phenomena, capital accumulation and sustainable development, and reviews the most popular Marxian topic in Economics: the transformation of values into prices of production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commodity</field><field name="subject">money</field><field name="subject">form of value</field><field name="subject">exchange value</field><field name="subject">labour value</field><field name="subject">mercantile value</field><field name="subject">use value</field><field name="subject">mercantile use value</field><field name="subject">comparative advantage</field><field name="subject">Marx</field><field name="subject">material production</field><field name="subject">invisible hand</field><field name="subject">dialectic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340100 Economic Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study to identify the concerns that New Zealand consumers have about business-to-consumer e-commerce</field><field name="creator">Trent, M. J. W.</field><field name="description">To date much of the literature on consumers' concerns about business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce has described findings from quantitative research. As a result, much of that literature has focused on specific previously-identified concerns (e.g., privacy of personal information, use of credit cards for on-line payment). Also, there has been little research into the concerns of New Zealand consumers, and all of it has been quantitative. In order to gain a broader understanding, this study took a qualitative approach. Three focus groups were conducted, in order to identify consumers' concerns. The concerns that were thus identified were combined with those that a review of the literature had previously identified, and were used to draw up a set of guidelines to be used in semi-structured interviews. Fifteen interviews were then conducted, in order to gain consumers' views about each concern. It seems that at a higher level, consumer's concerns have shifted. The literature suggests that in the past consumers' concerns about Internet shopping have focused on the fact that Internet shopping is conducted via the Internet &#8211; as a result of which consumers have, for example, been concerned about the privacy of their personal information ('if I give them my e-mail address, will I get spam?') This study suggests that now consumers' concerns focus on the fact that Internet shopping is a form of shopping &#8211; as a result of which they are now only prepared to use the Web sites of 'reputable companies', and they now require to be able to evaluate an item adequately before buying it. And it seems that another result of this is that consumers now expect that the 'reputable companies' whose Web sites they visit will &#8211; as a matter of course - address to their satisfaction issues such as the privacy of their personal information. While there are some types of products that consumers are prepared to buy on-line (e.g., air travel), there are many about which they are reluctant. Concerns were expressed about a wide range of potential purchases, and for a variety of reasons; also, some data was inconsistent (for example, some consumers were not prepared to buy clothes on-line, but others were). This appears to be an area in which consumer attitudes are still evolving. It is suggested that it may be helpful for further research on this matter to consider both demographic factors and the degree of consumer involvement in particular types of purchases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B2C e-commerce</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">consumer involvement</field><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">Internet shopping</field><field name="subject">shopping on-line</field><field name="subject">perceived risk</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical frameworks and contemporary M&#257;ori development</field><field name="creator">Feary, Mark S.</field><field name="description">M&#257;ori have entered a period of development that, more than ever before, requires them to explore complex options and make careful decisions about the way forward.  This complexity stems from three particular areas.  First, from having essentially two sets of rights, as New Zealanders and as M&#257;ori, and being active in the struggle to retain those rights.  Second, from trying to define and determine development pathways that are consistent with their traditional M&#257;ori values, and which align with their desire to participate in and enjoy a modern New Zealand and a global society.  Third, from attempting development within a political and societal environment that is governed by a different and dominant culture.  M&#257;ori, historically and contemporarily, have a culture that leads them to very different views of the world and development pathways than pakeha New Zealanders (D. Marsden, 1994, p. 697). Despite concerted effort and mis placed belief the M&#257;ori world view has survived and is being adopted by M&#257;ori youth.  The M&#257;ori worldview sometimes collides with the view of the governing pakeha culture of New Zealand, which values rights, assets and behaviours differently.  Despite these differences and the complexities it remains important to measure progress and inform debate about best practice and future options.  In this regard, statistical information is crucial, and is generally recognised as one of the currencies of development (World Summit of the Information Society, 2003).  M&#257;ori increasingly desire to measure and be informed about the feasibility and progress of their development choices in a way that is relevant to their values and culture.  Where a M&#257;ori view of reality is not present there is a high risk that decisions and actions will reflect a different worldview, will fail to deal with cultural complexities, and ultimately will not deliver the intended development outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280101 Information systems organisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative analysis of trade-related issues in the global kiwifruit industry</field><field name="creator">Anker-Kofoed, Ellen</field><field name="description">New Zealand is currently the third largest global producer of kiwifruit and thus plays an important role in the international market. Exports of kiwifruit are also of significant horticultural value for New Zealand and in 2007 the kiwifruit industry accounted for export values of NZ$790 million. The global kiwifruit market has experienced substantial changes in recent years and is likely to change significantly in the near future due to developments in production sources, adjustments to trade policy settings and shifts in consumer preferences. The New Zealand kiwifruit industry needs to consider what the impacts of these changes might be so that future strategies can be constructed effectively. Little quantitative modelling has been done in New Zealand to consider the impacts of changes to the global kiwifruit industry. The major contribution of this research was the development and calibration of a kiwifruit industry-specific partial equilibrium trade model. The model was then used to examine the impacts on New Zealand producers of these trade-related changes in the global kiwifruit market. Three relevant scenarios were developed for this purpose. They include a drop in EU demand through the introduction of a stricter Sanitary and Phytosanitary policy, an expansion of the Chinese kiwifruit industry where production is doubled by year 2013 and finally a trade liberalisation scenario where current import tariffs on kiwifruit were removed worldwide. It is clearly observed, through both the Chinese expansion scenario and the trade liberalisation scenario, what a potential impact and future role China has as a world market player. Increased availability of Chinese kiwifruit appears to affect New Zealand producer returns and exported quantities negatively, albeit not as significantly as the EU introduction of an SPS policy. A trade liberalisation scenario, on the other hand, proves to increase New Zealand grower returns significantly for all varieties.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international trade</field><field name="subject">kiwifruit</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Kiwi</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">SPS</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The benefits and barriers to GIS for M&#257;ori</field><field name="creator">Pacey, H. A.</field><field name="description">A Geographic Information System visually communicates both spatial and temporal analyses and has been available for at least twenty years in New Zealand.  Using a Kaupapa M&#257;ori Research framework, this research investigates the benefits and barriers for M&#257;ori if they were to adopt GIS to assist their development outcomes.  Internationally, indigenous peoples who have adopted GIS have reported they have derived significant cultural development benefits, including the preservation and continuity of traditional knowledge and culture.  As M&#257;ori development continues to expand in an increasing array of corporate, scientific, management and cultural arenas, the level of intensity required to keep abreast of developments has also expanded.  GIS has been used by some roop&#363; to assist their contemporary M&#257;ori development opportunities; has been suggested as a cost effective method for spatial research for Waitangi Tribunal claims; has supported and facilitated complex textual and oral evidence, and has also been used to assist negotiation and empowerment at both central and local government level.  While many successful uses are attributed to GIS projects, there are also precautionary calls made from practitioners regarding the obstacles they have encountered.  Overall, whilst traditional knowledge and contemporary technology has been beneficially fused together, in some instances hidden or unforeseen consequences have impeded or imperilled seamless uptake of this new technology.   Challenges to the establishment of a GIS range from the theoretical (mapping cultural heritage) to the practical (access to data) to the pragmatic (costs and resources).  The multiple issues inherent in mapping cultural heritage, indigenous cartography and, in particular, the current lack of intellectual property rights protection measures, are also potential barriers to successful, long-term integration of GIS into the tribal development matrix.  The key impediments to GIS establishment identified by surveyed roop&#363; were lack of information and human resources, and prioritisation over more critical factors affecting tangata whenua.  Respondents also indicated they would utilise GIS if the infrastructure was in place and the cost of establishment decreased.  Given the large amount of resources to be invested into GIS, and the opportunity to establish safe practices to ensure continuity of the GIS, it is prudent to make informed decisions prior to investment.  As an applied piece of Kaupapa M&#257;ori research, a tangible outcome in the form of an establishment Guide is presented.  Written in a deliberately novice-friendly manner, the Guide traverses fundamental issues surrounding the establishment of a GIS including investment costs and establishment processes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">indigenous mapping</field><field name="subject">Geographic Information System (GIS)</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori Research</field><field name="subject">M&#257;ori development</field><field name="subject">indigenous intellectual property rights</field><field name="subject">mapping cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fate of nitrogen in lactose-depleted dairy factory effluent irrigated onto land</field><field name="creator">Ford, Colleen D.</field><field name="description">A two-year lysimeter study was undertaken to compare the environmental effects (e.g. nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions) of soil applied lactose-depleted dairy factory effluent (LD-DFE) with lactose-rich DFE. The aim of this experiment was to determine the fate of nitrogen from LD-DFE and dairy cow urine applied to a Templeton fine sandy loam soil (Udic Ustrochrept), supporting a herbage cover of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). Measurements were carried out on the amount of nitrogen lost from the soil via leaching, lost by denitrification, removed by the pasture plants, and immobilized within the soil organic fraction. Further, a comparison between the fate of nitrogen in LD-DFE irrigated onto land under a "cut and carry" system, as opposed to a "grazed" pasture system was undertaken. Lactose-depleted dairy factory effluent was applied at three-weekly intervals during the summer months at rates of 25 and 50 mm, until nitrogen loading targets of 300 and 600 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; had been achieved. Measured leaching losses of nitrogen averaged 2 and 7 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; for Control 25 and Control 50 treatments; 21, 20 and 58 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; for 25 and 50 mm "cut and carry" treatments respectively; and 96 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; for the 25 mm "grazed" treatment. The range of nitrate-N leaching loss from LD-DFE plus urine is no different from the lactose-rich DFE nitrate leaching loss. Uptake of nitrogen by the growing pasture averaged 153, 184,340,352,483, and 415 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; for Control 25, Control 50, LD-DFE 25 and LD-DFE 50 mm "cut and carry" treatments, and the LD-DFE 25 mm "grazed" treatment, respectively. Denitrification losses were 0.06, 4.4, 1.69, 19.70, and 7.4 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; for Control 25, the LD-DFE 25 "cut and carry" treatments, the LD-DFE 25 mm "grazed" treatment, and calculated "paddock losses", respectively. Isotopic nitrogen studies found that 29.4 and 25.8% of applied LD-DFE nitrogen was immobilised in the LD-DFE 25 and LD-DFE 50 "cut and carry" treatments. The results of this experiment confirm the findings of the previous lactose-rich DFE study, in that the effects of grazing stock are of greater environmental concern than the removal of lactose from the effluent waste stream.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">lactose depleted dairy factory effluent (LD-DFE)</field><field name="subject">nitrate leaching</field><field name="subject">denitrification</field><field name="subject">immobilisation</field><field name="subject">nitrous oxide emissions</field><field name="subject">lysimeter study</field><field name="subject">environmental effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300104 Land capability and soil degradation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimates of the nutritional cost of the development of immunity to gastrointestinal parasites in sheep</field><field name="creator">Greer, Andrew W.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a series of three experiments designed to estimate the nutritional cost of the immune response to the gastrointestinal nematodes Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia circumcincta in sheep. For each experiment, animals were allocated hierarchically by liveweight into one of four groups that were either infected (group IF), similarly infected and concurrently immuno-suppressed with weekly intramuscular injections of 1.3mg kg liveweight (LW)&#8315;&#185; of methylprednisolone acetate (group ISIF), immunosuppressed only (group IS) or remained as controls (group C). Body composition of all animals was estimated using x-ray computer tomography prior to infection and at the conclusion of each study with bodyweight and faecal nematode egg counts (FEC; eggs gram&#8315;&#185; of fresh faeces (epg)) measured along with blood samples taken for the determination of levels of serum proteins, phosphate and antibodies. In the first trial (Chapter 3), the nutritional cost of both the acquisition and maintenance of immunity to gastro-intestinal nematodes was investigated using immunologically naive 5-month-old lambs and immunologically competent 17-month-old ewes during infection with 2,000 and 4,000 L3 infective T. colubriformis larvae d&#8315;&#185;, respectively (80 L3 T. colubriformis larvae kgLW&#8315;&#185; d&#8315;&#185;). Profiles of FEC and comparative worm burdens at slaughter indicated an effective immune response was maintained in IF ewes and developed in IF lambs while successfully suppressed in both ISIF lambs and ISIF ewes and was confirmed by serum antibody titres. The typical reduction in voluntary feed intake as a consequence of infection was observed in IF lambs (0.30, p&lt;0.001) but not in IF ewes, ISIF lambs or ISIF ewes, and appeared to be associated with L3 IgA. Gross efficiency of use of metabolizable energy (ME) for net energy (NE) deposition was reduced by 0.20 in lambs during acquisition of immunity and by 0.16 in ewes maintaining an established immunity. Infection in immuno-suppressed animals reduced efficiency by 0.05 and 0.15 for lambs and ewes. These findings allowed the hypothesis that the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization in young parasitized sheep is caused by physiological signalling associated with the acquisition phase of the host immune response to infection, rather than simply the damage caused by the parasite per se. The second trial (Chapter 4) investigated the influence of metabolizable protein (MP) supply on the metabolic disturbances associated with the acquisition phase of the immune response during infection with 2,000 L3 T. colubriformis d&#8315;&#185;. Groups of lambs were offered either a low protein (L; 62g MP kgDM&#8315;&#185;) or high protein diet (H; 95g MP kgDM&#8315;&#185;). Patterns of total daily egg excretion indicated that an effective immune response was developed in HIF, but not LIF, HISIF nor LISF and was confirmed by comparative worm burdens. The proportionate reduction in feed intake in immunologically normal animals was reduced through the provision of additional protein, being 0.12 in HIF and 0.23 in LIF. Regardless of diet, infection did not cause a reduction in feed intake in immuno-suppressed animals (p&gt;0.05). Infection proportionately reduced the gross efficiency of ME utilization in immunologically normal animals by 0.23 in HIF (p=0.09) and by 0.51 in LIF (p=0.01), but not in immuno-suppressed animals. Immuno-suppression did not suppress serum L3 IgA levels in seven of the eight HISIF and four of the eight LISIF animals. Furthermore, only four out of the eight immunologically normal animals from both the HIF and LIF groups displayed an L3 IgA response. Consequently, regardless of immunosuppression treatment, animals were termed as IgA responders (HR or LR) or non-responders (HN or LN). Feed intake was proportionately reduced from day 22 by 0.15 in HR (p=0.03) and by 0.32 in LR (p=0.01), but was not significantly reduced in HN or LN. Gross efficiency of ME utilization was significantly reduced for LN animals only, being proportionately 0.59 (p&lt;0.01). These findings allowed the conclusion that additional MP reduced the consequence of immunological signalling that was displayed in reduced feed intake and in nutrient utilization, both of which appeared to be associated with an IgA response. It is hypothesized that the lessening of nutritional disturbance observed in high protein and immuno-suppressed animals could be a consequence of altered physiological signalling during the immunological cascade. The third trial (Chapter 5) utilized lambs infected with the abomasal parasite T. circumcincta to explore the possibility that the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization is a universal phenomenon of the acquisition phase of the immune response to nematode parasites inhabiting different organs along the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, immunological changes at the site of parasite infestation in the abomasal mucosa were measured from serial biopsy tissue samples taken from a further twelve animals that were surgically fitted with an abomasal cannula and either infected (CIF) or concurrently infected and immuno-suppressed as described previously (CISIF). The development of immunity in IF animals was accompanied by a 0.17 proportional decrease in feed intake between days 15 to 28 of infection (p&lt;0.05) and a 0.20 proportional reduction in nutrient utilization (p=0.07), none of which were observed in ISIF animals. While FEC and worm burdens indicated successful immunosuppression in ISIF animals, both serum IgA and total antibody production were not reduced. The development of immunity in CIF was reflected in an increase in both mast cells and globule leukocytes in serial abomasal tissue biopsies, both of which were reduced in CISIF (p&lt;0.01 for both). In serial biopsy tissue, immuno-suppression did prevent a rise in tissue IgA that was apparent in CIF animals (p&lt;0.01) although these changes were not reflected in serum IgA levels. It appears that the alleviation of the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization in young lambs through the use of corticosteroid induced immuno-suppression may be a universal phenomenon for both intestinal and abomasal parasites, but the association with and/or role of IgA during infection with T. circumcincta is unclear. In summary, the reduction in feed intake and nutrient utilization in sheep during infection with both the abomasal nematode T. circumcincta and the small intestine nematode T. colubriformis appears to be associated with a component(s) of the acquisition phase of the host immune response, rather than, as conventionally assumed, the direct mechanical damage of the parasite per se. It is hypothesised that the nutritional disturbance as a consequence of infection in young lambs may be the result of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immunological signalling that may also be associated with the production of IgA, the effects of which can be reduced through the provision of adequate MP. These studies provide evidence that the immune response to gastrointestinal parasites is nutritionally costly to the animal and have implications for application of manipulations that are intended to promote the development of a strong immune reaction in high producing animals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">nematoda</field><field name="subject">immunity</field><field name="subject">intake</field><field name="subject">utilisation of energy</field><field name="subject">Teladorsagia circumcincta</field><field name="subject">Trichostrongylus colubriformis</field><field name="subject">Immunoglobulin A</field><field name="subject">immuno-suppression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimisation of permeable reactive barrier systems for the remediation of contaminated groundwater</field><field name="creator">Painter, Brett D. M.</field><field name="description">Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) are one of the leading technologies being developed in the search for alternatives to the pump-and-treat method for the remediation of contaminated groundwater. A new optimising design methodology is proposed to aid decision-makers in finding minimum cost PRB designs for remediation problems in the presence of input uncertainty. The unique aspects of the proposed methodology are considered to be: design enhancements to improve the hydraulic performance of PRB systems; elimination of a time-consuming simulation model by determination of approximating functions relating design variables and performance measures for fully penetrating PRB systems; a versatile, spreadsheet-based optimisation model that locates minimum cost PRB designs using Excel's standard non-linear solver; and the incorporation of realistic input variability and uncertainty into the optimisation process via sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis and factorial analysis. The design methodology is developed in the context of the remediation of nitrate contamination due to current concerns with nitrate in New Zealand. Three-dimensional computer modelling identified significant variation in capture and residence time, caused by up-gradient funnels and/or a gate hydraulic conductivity that is significantly different from the surrounding aquifer. The unique design enhancements to control this variation are considered to be the customised down-gradient gate face and emplacement of funnels and side walls deeper than the gate. The use of velocity equalisation walls and manipulation of a PRB's hydraulic conductivity within certain bounds were also found to provide some control over variation in capture and residence time. Accurate functional relationships between PRB design variables and PRB performance measures were shown to be achievable for fully penetrating systems. The chosen design variables were gate length, gate width, funnel width and the reactive material proportion. The chosen performance measures were edge residence, centreline residence and capture width. A method for laboratory characterisation of reactive and non-reactive material combinations was shown to produce data points that could realistically be part of smooth polynomial interpolation functions. The use of smooth approximating functions to characterise PRB inputs and determine PRB performance enabled the creation of an efficient spreadsheet model that ran more quickly and accurately with Excel's standard non-linear solver than with the LGO global solver or Evolver genetic-algorithm based solver. The PRB optimisation model will run on a standard computer and only takes a couple of minutes per optimisation run. Significant variation is expected in inputs to PRB design, particularly in aquifer and plume characteristics. Not all of this variation is quantifiable without significant expenditure. Stochastic models that include parameter variability have historically been difficult to apply to realistic remediation design due to their size and complexity. Scenario and factorial analysis are proposed as an efficient alternative for quantifying the effects of input variability on optimal PRB design. Scenario analysis is especially recommended when high quality input information is available and variation is not expected in many input parameters. Factorial analysis is recommended for most other situations as it separates out the effects of multiple input parameters at multiple levels without an excessive number of experimental runs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contamination</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">remediation</field><field name="subject">permeable reactive barrier</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291101 Environmental engineering modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demand for genetically modified food : theory and empirical findings</field><field name="creator">Kaye-Blake, William</field><field name="description">As economies develop, novel products are created and markets for these products arise. Genetically modified food (GMF) is an example of such a novel product and provides economists with the opportunity to investigate an infant market. Of particular interest with GMF is the impact of consumer reactions on the market. The response of consumers to GMF and their willingness to pay for it has emerged as an important factor in the development of this technology. This research investigates these consumer responses. Prior research suggests that two aspects of consumer behaviour may be relevant for the GMF market. First, consumers may react differently to different types of GMF, so that some products are potentially more economically viable. Secondly, some consumers appear to prefer not having GMF at all. Consumer behaviour is often framed according to neoclassical economic theory. Consumer preferences over goods and the attributes of those goods are generally held to have certain properties. The aspects of consumers' reactions to GMF noted above, however, may be in conflict with two properties of preferences in neoclassical theory. First, preferences over food attributes are not separable, but may interact with each other. Secondly, some consumers may have preferences regarding GMF that are not continuous. As a result, aggregate impacts of introducing GMF may be difficult to measure, which raises a third issue for investigation, aggregation. Finally, an alternative model of consumer behaviour is bounded rationality, which theorises that choices may be discontinuous as a result of specific protocols. It also suggests that consumers seek to make good-enough choices, rather than attempting to maximise their satisfaction. Thus, optimisation or maximisation is the fourth issue considered in this thesis. In order to investigate these properties of consumers' preferences, a choice experiment survey was developed. The strength of a choice experiment for examining these issues is its focus on the impact of each product attribute on a respondent's choices. Thus, it may be possible to identify potentially discontinuous choice patterns and to identify choices affected by interactions between GM technology and other food attributes. Results from a neoclassical analysis of the survey data suggest that some consumers consider the type of benefit created with GM technology in making their choices. In addition, one-quarter to one-half of respondents may have had discontinuous preferences with respect to GMF. Reactions to GMF appear related to respondents' attitudes, but not to socio-economic or demographic descriptors. As a result, aggregate measures of the impact of GMF may not fully account for consumers' responses. A boundedly rational model also has reasonable goodness of fit, and may provide a different perspective on consumer behaviour. It is hoped that the results of this research provide a better understanding of consumer behaviour regarding GMF and, by extension, of the process of consumer adoption of novel products. It is further hoped that this attempt to incorporate choice protocols into discrete choice analysis will provide a useful example for further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetically modified food</field><field name="subject">choice modelling</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">bounded rationality</field><field name="subject">lexicographic</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximising the effectiveness of aerial 1080 control of possums (Trichosurus vulpecula)</field><field name="creator">Morgan, David R.</field><field name="description">Aerial control using 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) baits is widely used in New Zealand for the control of introduced brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula), with the aim of protecting national conservation and agricultural values from these damaging pests. This thesis integrates research, completed over 25 years, that was motivated by growing recognition in the 1970s of the extent of possum impacts and the need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the control operation. Field research assessed the palatability of three types of cereal-based pellet baits and carrot baits in different regions, habitat types and seasons. Palatability was assessed by the consumption of the different bait types presented independently of each other on 15-30 plots, with rotation of bait types at plots on successive nights to provide equal exposure to each bait type. There was regional variation in possums' bait preferences, possibly reflecting genotypic differences, whereas seasonal variation was less evident. Carrot bait was preferred or equally preferred to cereal bait in 14 out of 20 field trials. The proportion of possums eating baits was then investigated by, firstly, developing a technique for tracing bait acceptance using rhodamine B, a UV-fluorescent dye. In four field trials, more than 95% of possums accepted three types of dye-marked bait, eliminating bait refusal as a major reason for low kills in winter control operations. In a fifth trial, conducted in summer, only 68% of possums accepted bait suggesting that seasonal availability of favoured foods may influence bait acceptance. Since possums must encounter baits before deciding whether to eat them, field studies were undertaken to assess the coverage achieved in normal aerial baiting operations. Large gaps, up to 400 m in width, were often found between baiting swaths; these could allow some possums to survive. A controlled field experiment, using acceptance of rhodamine-dyed bait as a measure of effectiveness, showed that bait distribution was least accurate where flight paths were not marked. Where gaps of 100 m between flight paths were deliberately created, bait acceptance was slower and less than where coverage was complete. Sowing baits at 3 kg/ha was as effective as at 10 kg/ha, indicating the potential for substantially reducing operational costs by using machinery capable of faultlessly distributing baits at low rates. Navigational guidance systems were evaluated and found to improve the accuracy of bait distribution. During 1993-1997, when a lower sowing rate of 5 kg/ha was adopted operationally by regional managers, control effectiveness was unchanged but annual savings of around $9 million accrued. Because of the lack of suitable sowing machinery, a bucket was developed to permit faultless distribution of baits at lower rates, demonstrating the possibility of yet further cost-savings. The possibility of seasonal food availability affecting bait acceptance was investigated in three different forest habitats. Dyed baits were aerially distributed on 100 ha at each site in each season over two years. In each trial, fat-based condition indices of possums were calculated and the abundance of possum-preferred plant foods described. Bait acceptance was consistently high (85-100%) in the 24 trials, and was not influenced by either condition or availability of preferred foods. It seems likely that seasonal variation in operational effectiveness is caused by either the availability of sharply seasonal, scarce foods that possums may feed on intensively for brief periods, or by warmer temperatures that render 1080 less effective. The influence of 1080 on acceptance of (rhodamine-dyed) baits was investigated in a field trial. Examination of possums for dye-marking showed that 25% of possums refused to eat either a lethal quantity of bait or any bait at all, compared with 98% of possums eating non-toxic bait. This indicated that 1080 is aversive to possums, which is a potential major reason for their surviving control operations. Pen trials were therefore conducted to further examine the problem and to seek solutions. Toxic carrot baits were rejected by 27.5% of possums, equally by smell and taste aversion, whereas toxic cereal pellets were rejected by 34%, mainly by taste aversion. Orange and cinnamon were shown to be among the most preferred of 42 flavours tested and, when applied to toxic baits, 1080 was effectively masked. Bait refusal was reduced to &#8804;7%, the same as that recorded for possums presented with flavoured non-toxic baits. For long-term control of possum populations, aerial 1080 baiting can be used sequentially with other poisoning methods. However, the compatibility of these methods is dependent on the likelihood of possums developing bait shyness if sublethally dosed. Studies were therefore conducted to characterise and compare the four main toxicants used (1080, cyanide, cholecalciferol and brodifacoum) for induction and mitigation of bait shyness. Shyness was induced in approximately 80% of possums sublethally dosed with cyanide, 60% with 1080, 20% with cholecalciferol, and 0% with brodifacoum. Cyanide and 1080 shyness were found to persist in many possums for at least 12 and 24 months, respectively. Use of alternative bait types, and of baits containing an alternative slow-acting toxin (brodifacoum) were shown to be effective ways of overcoming shyness. This, and other related research, is reviewed to provide operational specifications that maximise the likelihood that all targeted possums will (i) encounter bait, (ii) eat it, and (iii) die. The likely future use of aerial 1080 baiting is described and the technological, economic, environmental and social constraints on its sustainability are discussed. Finally, the uptake of the research by possum managers is considered, and areas identified in the thesis where information is incomplete are summarised as prioritised topics for further research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brushtail possum</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">vertebrate pest control</field><field name="subject">baits</field><field name="subject">aerial baiting</field><field name="subject">bait palatability</field><field name="subject">bait acceptance</field><field name="subject">bait aversion</field><field name="subject">bait shyness</field><field name="subject">sodium monofluoroacetate</field><field name="subject">1080</field><field name="subject">cyanide</field><field name="subject">cholecalciferol</field><field name="subject">brodifacoum</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300803 Natural resources management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300600 Forestry Sciences::300603 Pests, health and diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of ripening grape compounds on behavioural responses of birds</field><field name="creator">Saxton, V. P.</field><field name="description">Vineyards in New Zealand suffer bird damage caused by several avian species, including blackbirds and silvereyes. The introduced European Blackbird takes whole grapes which reduces yield. The self-introduced Australasian Silvereye pecks on grapes, leaving them on the vine to be further attacked by fungi and bacteria, and the subsequent off-odours can cause grapes to be refused by the winery or to suffer a price-reduction. Bird control methods remain primitive and largely ineffective during the long ripening period of wine grapes. An ecologically sound method to manage and reduce bird pressure requires deeper understanding of why some birds eat grapes, especially since grapes are not particularly nutritious. This work investigated the extent to which blackbirds and silvereyes are attracted by various compounds in ripening grapes. Since in natural grapes these compounds develop and change simultaneously, I developed an artificial grape in which a single parameter could be investigated. Artificial grapes (and sometimes nectar) were presented on a bird feeder table and the responses of birds to hexose sugars, the aromas 2-3-isobutylmethoxypyrazine and geraniol, tartaric and malic acids, grape tannins, and purple and green colour were recorded on timelapse video and analysed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vineyards</field><field name="subject">bird damage</field><field name="subject">artificial grape</field><field name="subject">blackbirds</field><field name="subject">silvereyes</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">hexose sugar</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">acid</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">tannin</field><field name="subject">bird management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of wild deer in the epidemiology and management of bovine tuberculosis in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nugent, Graham</field><field name="description">The eco-epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (Tb) in wild deer (mainly red deer Cervus elaphus) in New Zealand was investigated. Bovine Tb is caused by Mycobacterium bovis. Specific aims were to clarify the likely routes of infection in deer, and to determine the status of deer as hosts of Tb, the likely rates and routes of inter- and intra-species transmission between deer and other wildlife hosts, the role of deer in spreading Tb, and the likely utility of deer as sentinels of Tb presence in wildlife. As the possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the main wildlife host of Tb, the research also included some investigation of transmission routes in possums. Patterns of infection were measured in 994 deer killed between 1993 and 2003. Tb prevalence varied between areas (range 8&#8211;36%). Few deer had generalised infection, with 21&#8211;68% of infected deer having no visible lesions, depending on the area. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes and oropharyngeal tonsils were commonly infected. No dependent fawns less than 0.75 years old were infected, indicating intra-species transmission is rare in wild deer. Where possums were not controlled, the net (cumulative) force of infection in young (1&#8211;4 y) deer was 0.10&#8211;0.24 per year in males and 0.09&#8211;0.12 per year in females, but much lower in older deer (less than 0.05 per year). Possum control reduced the net force of infection quickly, and eventually to zero. However, Tb persisted in possum-controlled areas through immigration of infected deer and, for almost a decade, through the survival of resident deer infected before possum control. Tb was lost from infected deer at an exponential rate of 0.13 per year, mostly as a result of deer recovering from infection rather than dying from it. Wild deer do die of Tb, but there was no discernible effect on age structure. The occurrence of infection in deer was not linked to the local deer or possum density at their kill sites (i.e. in their home range), but the area-wide prevalence of Tb in deer was closely correlated with Tb levels in possums, which were in turn correlated with area-wide measures of possum density. For wild deer in New Zealand, Tb is a persistent but usually inconsequential disease of the lymphatic system. It is acquired mainly by young independent deer, usually orally via the tonsils, and probably as a result of licking infected possums. Many species fed on deer carrion, including possums. Most possums encountering carrion did not feed on it, but a few fed for long periods. Other scavengers such ferrets (Mustela furo), hawks (Circus approximans), and weka (a hen-sized flightless native bird; Gallirallus australis) fed in a way that probably increased the infectivity of carrion to possums. Commercial deer hunting may have facilitated the historical establishment of Tb in possums. Scavenging (including cannibalism) and interactions with dead and dying possums are identified for the first time as potentially important routes for transmission of Tb to possums, and I develop new hypotheses involving peri- and post-mortem transmission in possums that explain many of the epidemiological patterns that are characteristic of the disease in possum. In continuous native forest, deer home range size averaged 250 hectares for six young females, and over twice that for two males. Over 90% of infected deer are likely to die within 2 km (females) or 6 km (males) of where they acquired Tb, but deer could occasionally carry Tb up to 30 km. Deer will be useful as sentinels, but only where other sentinels are rare, because the force of infection for a deer with a single infected possum in its home range is only 0.004 per year, compared to greater than 0.2 per year for deliberately released pigs. Deer are occasionally capable of initiating new cycles of infection in wildlife, but deer control is not essential to eradicate Tb from wildlife.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">bovine tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Mycobacterium bovis</field><field name="subject">wild deer</field><field name="subject">Cervus elaphus</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Tb</field><field name="subject">pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">brushtail possum</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">prevalence</field><field name="subject">intra-species transmission</field><field name="subject">inter-species transmission</field><field name="subject">resolution of infection</field><field name="subject">scavenging</field><field name="subject">cannibalism</field><field name="subject">sentinel</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of long- and short-term crop management on soil biological properties and nitrogen dynamics</field><field name="creator">Stark, Christine H.</field><field name="description">To date, there has been little research into the role of microbial community structure in the functioning of the soil ecosystem and on the links between microbial biomass size, microbial activity and key soil processes that drive nutrient availability. The maintenance of structural and functional diversity of the soil microbial community is essential to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production systems. Soils of the same type with similar fertility that had been under long-term organic and conventional crop management in Canterbury, New Zealand, were selected to investigate relationships between microbial community composition, function and potential environmental impacts. The effects of different fertilisation strategies on soil biology and nitrogen (N) dynamics were investigated under field (farm site comparison), semi-controlled (lysimeter study) and controlled (incubation experiments) conditions by determining soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and N, enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, arginine deaminase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis), microbial community structure (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis following PCR amplification of 16S and 18S rDNA fragments using selected primer sets) and N dynamics (mineralisation and leaching). The farm site comparison revealed distinct differences between the soils in microbial community structure, microbial biomass C (conventional&gt;organic) and arginine deaminase activity (organic&gt;conventional). In the lysimeter study, the soils were subjected to the same crop rotation (barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), maize (Zea mais L.), rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera (Moench)) plus a lupin green manure (Lupinus angustifolius L.) and two fertiliser regimes (following common organic and conventional practice). Soil biological properties, microbial community structure and mineral N leaching losses were determined over 2&#189; years. Differences in mineral leaching losses were not significant between treatments (total organic management: 24.2 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;; conventional management: 28.6 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;). Crop rotation and plant type had a larger influence on the microbial biomass, activity and community structure than fertilisation. Initial differences between soils decreased over time for most biological soil properties, while they persisted for the enzyme activities (e.g. dehydrogenase activity: 4.0 and 2.9 &#181;g g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; for organic and conventional management history, respectively). A lack of consistent positive links between enzyme activities and microbial biomass size indicated that similarly sized and structured microbial communities can express varying rates of activity. In two successive incubation experiments, the soils were amended with different rates of a lupin green manure (4 or 8t dry matter ha&#8315;&#185;), and different forms of N at 100 kg ha&#8315;&#185; (urea and lupin) and incubated for 3 months. Samples were taken periodically, and in addition to soil biological properties and community structure, gross N mineralisation was determined. The form of N had a strong effect on microbial soil properties. Organic amendment resulted in a 2 to 5-fold increase in microbial biomass and enzyme activities, while microbial community structure was influenced by the addition or lack of C or N substrate. Correlation analyses suggested treatment-related differences in nutrient availability, microbial structural diversity (species richness or evenness) and physiological properties of the microbial community. The findings of this thesis showed that using green manures and crop rotations improved soil biology in both production systems, that no relationships existed between microbial structure, enzyme activities and N mineralisation, and that enzyme activities and microbial community structure are more closely associated with inherent soil and environmental factors, which makes them less useful as early indicators of changes in soil quality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial community structure</field><field name="subject">soil biology</field><field name="subject">soil processes</field><field name="subject">function</field><field name="subject">past and current management</field><field name="subject">organic and conventional farming practices</field><field name="subject">lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) green manure</field><field name="subject">urea</field><field name="subject">intact monolith lysimeters</field><field name="subject">N dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling genetic regulatory networks: a new model for circadian rhythms in Drosophila and investigation of genetic noise in a viral infection process</field><field name="creator">Xie, Zhi</field><field name="description">In spite of remarkable progress in molecular biology, our understanding of the dynamics and functions of intra- and inter-cellular biological networks has been hampered by their complexity. Kinetics modelling, an important type of mathematical modelling, provides a rigorous and reliable way to reveal the complexity of biological networks. In this thesis, two genetic regulatory networks have been investigated via kinetic models. In the first part of the study, a model is developed to represent the transcriptional regulatory network essential for the circadian rhythms in Drosophila. The model incorporates the transcriptional feedback loops revealed so far in the network of the circadian clock (PER/TIM and VRI/PDP1 loops). Conventional Hill functions are not used to describe the regulation of genes, instead the explicit reactions of binding and unbinding processes of transcription factors to promoters are modelled. The model is described by a set of ordinary differential equations and the parameters are estimated from the in vitro experimental data of the clocks' components. The simulation results show that the model reproduces sustained circadian oscillations in mRNA and protein concentrations that are in agreement with experimental observations. It also simulates the entrainment by light-dark cycles, the disappearance of the rhythmicity in constant light and the shape of phase response curves resembling that of experimental results. The model is robust over a wide range of parameter variations. In addition, the simulated E-box mutation, perS and perL mutants are similar to that observed in the experiments. The deficiency between the simulated mRNA levels and experimental observations in per01, tim01 and clkJrk mutants suggests some differences in the model from reality. Finally, a possible function of VRI/PDP1 loops is proposed to increase the robustness of the clock. In the second part of the study, the sources of intrinsic noise and the influence of extrinsic noise are investigated on an intracellular viral infection system. The contribution of the intrinsic noise from each reaction is measured by means of a special form of stochastic differential equation, the chemical Langevin equation. The intrinsic noise of the system is the linear sum of the noise in each of the reactions. The intrinsic noise arises mainly from the degradation of mRNA and the transcription processes. Then, the effects of extrinsic noise are studied by means of a general form of stochastic differential equation. It is found that the noise of the viral components grows logarithmically with increasing noise intensities. The system is most susceptible to noise in the virus assembly process. A high level of noise in this process can even inhibit the replication of the viruses. In summary, the success of this thesis demonstrates the usefulness of models for interpreting experimental data, developing hypotheses, as well as for understanding the design principles of genetic regulatory networks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systems biology</field><field name="subject">genetic regulatory networks</field><field name="subject">mathematical molecular modelling</field><field name="subject">kinetic modelling</field><field name="subject">Hill function</field><field name="subject">stochastic modelling</field><field name="subject">stochastic differential equations</field><field name="subject">chemical Langevin equation</field><field name="subject">oscillations</field><field name="subject">circadian clock</field><field name="subject">circadian rhythms</field><field name="subject">Drosophila</field><field name="subject">intrinsic noise</field><field name="subject">extrinsic noise</field><field name="subject">viral infection</field><field name="subject">virus replication</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/31</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding constraints to cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) based pasture production</field><field name="creator">Mills, Annamaria</field><field name="description">This research examined the mechanisms by which temperature, water availability and nitrogen (N) affect the dry matter (DM) yield potential of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) dominant pastures. The experiment was a split plot design with main plots of fully irrigated (I) or dryland (D), sub-plots of N fertiliser at 800 kg N/ha in 2003/04; and 1600 kg N/ha in 2004/05 (+N) or 0 kg N/ha (-N). The potential environmental yield of an established 8 year old cocksfoot dominant pasture was 21.9 t DM/ha/y from I+N pastures compared with 9.8 t DM/ha by I-N pastures and 15.1 t DM/ha/y by D+N pastures. The lowest yields were from dryland pastures with no N which produced 7.5 t DM/ha/y in 2003/03 and 5.0 t DM/ha/y in 2004/05. The effect of seasonal temperatures on the DM production, when periods of water stress were excluded, was quantified using thermal time accumulated above a base temperature of 3&#176;C as 7.0 kg DM/&#176;Cd/ha for N fertilised pastures and 3.3 kg DM/&#176;Cd/ha for pastures with no N. The 2.5 t DM/ha difference in yields of D-N pastures in 2003/04 and 2004/05 was the result of the duration, extent and timing of the water stress period. In both years the critical limiting deficit (DL) was calculated as 78 mm from the soil moisture deficit in the 0-0.8 m soil layers. Beyond DL yield decreased at a rate of 1.45%/mm in +N and &#8211;N pastures, relative to fully irrigated control pastures. Yields of D+N and D-N pastures were similar during periods of water stress with 0.4&#177;0.1 t/DM/ha produced during the rotation ending 30/12/2003. This was less than from either the I-N (1.2 t DM/ha) or I+N (3.5 t DM/ha) pastures due to the reduction in the amount of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopies of the dryland pastures. However, in the rotation ending 2/5/2004, after autumn rain alleviated drought conditions, yield of the D+N pasture was 2.1 t DM/ha compared with 1.7 t DM/ha by I+N pastures. The effect of N on yield was described using a nutrition index which showed that as DM yield increased N% in the herbage declined. This is a function of the ratio between metabolic and structural N requirements rather than caused by ontogeny alone. Specific leaf N was determined at two harvests and appeared constant at a given point in time (1.0-1.6 g N/m&#178; leaf). In contrast, specific pseudostem N increased from 0.8-1.0 g N/m&#178; pseudostem at an NNI of 0.4 in &#8211;N pastures to 2.6-3.0 g N/m&#178; pseudostem at an NNI of 1.2 in the +N pastures. Differences between the yields of +N and &#8211;N pastures were caused by differences in radiation use efficiency (RUE) as determined by the linear relationship (R&#178;=0.76) between RUE and the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI). In this thesis, empirical relationships for the effects of temperature, water availability and N were derived and the physiological mechanisms which underlie these descriptions were identified. These relationships provide clear and simple explanations of the effects of environmental variables on the productivity of cocksfoot based pastures which will enhance understanding of the benefits and limitations of cocksfoot, particularly in dryland farming systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cocksfoot</field><field name="subject">Dactylis glomerata</field><field name="subject">leaf area index</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">orchardgrass</field><field name="subject">radiation interception</field><field name="subject">radiation use efficiency</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">water stress</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/32</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of suckling on response to nematode parasites in young lambs</field><field name="creator">Iposu, Shamsideen Oladeinde</field><field name="description">The series of experiments described in this thesis were designed to investigate the role of suckling or late weaning in the response of young lambs to nematode infection. All experiments were conducted outdoors with grazing animals and no supplementation but for suckled groups of lambs whose counterparts were weaned to ryegrass &#8211; white clover swards. The parasite of interest was mainly Teladorsagia circumcincta solely but with mixed infection of Trichostrongylus colubriformis in one instance. In Chapter 3 (first experiment), the hypothesis that milk per se may have a direct effect on nematode development, rather than an indirect effect through enhancement of host immunity by superior nutrient supply was tested. Sixty, twinborn lambs were used, allocated to one of eight groups formed by either dosing lambs from 42 days of age or not with the equivalent of 1000 or 250 L&#8323; T. circumcincta larvae d&#8315;&#185; until five days before necropsy, while a twin was either weaned at 39 days of age, suckled as single or twin until necropsy on day 84. The possibility that weaning one of a twin set onto pasture in close proximity to the ewe would cause abnormal ewe and lamb behaviour was tested by replicating the work in twins maintained as twins but in which one twin received equivalent of 250 and the other 1000 L&#8323; T. circumcincta larvae d&#8315;&#185;. This showed no abnormal ewe nursing or lamb suckling behaviour as a result of weaning a twin in a set. Relatively low faecal egg counts (FEC) and a two to three fold lower worm burdens suggest suckling could reduce larval establishment. Inability to detect peripheral titres of immunoglobulins supports this conclusion. An intra worm-population regulation of T. circumcincta, indicated by a pattern of greater egg-laying by a numerically smaller but physiologically better developed nematode population in suckled lambs measured in eggs 'in utero' and worm length made interpretation of FEC difficult. Suckling significantly improved weight gain and carcass weights, but early weaning did not reduce resilience to infection. In Chapter 4 (second experiment), 40 pairs of twin lambs, average age of 39 days, were either infected with the equivalent of 1000 L&#8323; T. circumcincta larvae d&#8315;&#185; or not, while one twin was weaned and the other allowed to continue suckling. Necropsy was carried out on groups of five and six lambs from each of the uninfected and infected treatments, respectively, at mean age of 84, 112, and on six lambs from each group at 140 days of age. This serial slaughter allowed further confirmation of the hypothesis in Chapter 3 but also investigated the long-term effect of suckling on resistance or resilience of lambs at the trial when immune responses were anticipated to be developing. An in vitro direct larval challenge (IVDC) study, to monitor larval establishment, was carried out on tissue explants from necropsied lambs. Suckled lambs consistently showed lower FEC (P &lt; 0.05) and worm burdens (P &lt; 0.05) at every phase of the trial. Within the infected groups, % in vitro larval rejection suggested earlier immune responses in the weaned lambs by day 84, which was not consistent with lower worm burdens in suckled lambs but appeared similar in the subsequent necropsies. Lambs continued to show better growth due to suckling while weaning did not reduce the resilience of lambs confirming observations in Chapter 3. The immunoglobulin profile suggested the commencement of immune responses in lambs from the period after the 84th day necropsy, with significantly greater (P &lt; 0.01) IgA titre in the infected groups, and the suckled lambs towards the end of the trial on day 140. A vaccinating effect of early exposure to parasites was coincidentally revealed as a result of unintentional pasture larval contamination, seen in suckled non-infected lambs shedding fewer eggs and harbouring fewer worms during the later necropsies compared with their weaned non-infected counterparts. In Chapter 5 (third trial), 93 pairs of twin lambs, 47 pairs of which received a vaccinating mixed infection of T. circumcincta and T. colubriformis larvae (60 L&#8323; / kg W / d) at ratio 40:60, respectively during the period 36 &#8211; 103 days of age, were either weaned early on day 51 or later on day 108. All lambs were drenched on day 108 and groups received challenge infections from day 116, at same rate with the vaccinating infection, or not, which ceased five days before respective necropsies. Necropsies were carried out on selected lambs on days 108, 184 and 218. The direct effect of milk on larval establishment appeared to feature only in the T. circumcincta populations on slaughter day 108. The long-term benefit of late weaning for development of resistance was conditional on lambs receiving the vaccinating infection, and appeared to be more pronounced in the small intestine, reflected by a greater reduction of T. colubriformis populations in that organ than of T. circumcincta populations in the abomasum. A negative consequence of enhanced immune response was the suggestion of an increased metabolic cost in reduced performance of lambs. In conclusion, the work provides support to the hypotheses that: (a.) suckling may reduce the establishment of nematode larvae through the direct effect of milk, (b.) may enhance rapid development of host immunity to infection, and (c.) it further suggests that lack of larval experience during suckling may have long term negative implications for host resistance. Finally, it suggests that milk may play little role in the enhancement of host resilience to infection and, on the contrary, that additional metabolic cost may be associated with a more rapid development of immunity resulting from larval challenge while suckling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lambs</field><field name="subject">weaning</field><field name="subject">suckling</field><field name="subject">milk</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">resilience</field><field name="subject">nematode</field><field name="subject">Teladorsagia circumcincta</field><field name="subject">Trichostrongylus colubriformis</field><field name="subject">IgA</field><field name="subject">IgM</field><field name="subject">antibody</field><field name="subject">abomasum</field><field name="subject">small intestine in vitro larval rejection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant breeding aspects of ryegrasses (Lolium sp.) infected with endophytic fungi</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alan V.</field><field name="description">Some aspects of the presence of systemic endophytic fungi in agriculturally important New Zealand grasses were studied in relation to plant breeding. Seedling resistance to adult Argentine stem weevil feeding in perennial ryegrass, Italian ryegrass and tall fescue was found to be related to the presence of their respective Acremonium endophytes in the seed rather than to plant genetic resistance. In addition a study of perennial ryegrass revealed that this resistance was independent of endophyte viability. The seedling resistance conferred by the endophyte of Italian ryegrass was found to be beneficial for field establishment. This endophyte differs from that in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue in that it does not confer resistance to Argentine stem weevil on mature plants, but only on seedlings. The extent of plant genetic seedling tolerance to adult Argentine stem weevil feeding was limited to broad inter-specific differences, with tall fescue more tolerant than perennial ryegrass and both of these more tolerant than Italian ryegrass. This ranking corresponds with previous observations on feeding preference on mature plants. A study of factors affecting the concentration of endophyte mycelia in infected seed of perennial ryegrass revealed that plant genetic factors had little effect. The major factors studied were: 1) the endophyte concentration in the maternal parent plant directly influenced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 2) nitrogen fertilizer applications to a seed crop reduced the concentration of mycelia in the seed, with earlier applications having a greater effect. 3) application of the fungicide propiconazole (Tilt) to a seed crop reduced the endophyte concentration in the seed. 4) the endophyte concentration in the seed was found to directly influence the endophyte concentration in seedlings, six month old plants and that of seed harvested from a first year seed crop. As there have been no previous reports of tetraploid perennial ryegrass cultivars with endophyte an experiment was conducted to determine if these could be developed by the standard procedure of colchicine treatment. The results revealed that endophyte was retained following colchicine treatment.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">Lolium</field><field name="subject">endophyte</field><field name="subject">Acremonium</field><field name="subject">seedling resistance</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">fungicide</field><field name="subject">tetraploid</field><field name="subject">Argentine stem weevil</field><field name="subject">Listronotus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300203 Plant improvement (selection, breeding and genetic engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the footsteps of the fellowship : understanding the expectations and experiences of Lord of the rings tourists on guided tours in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buchmann, Anne-Kristina</field><field name="description">This study seeks to gain an insight into the experiences Lord of the Rings tourists have on guided tours in New Zealand and the role of the tour guide(s) in that experience. The study examines motivations, expectations, actual experience and its evaluation and the role of the tour leader and guides. By drawing primarily on the results of qualitative research that examined the experience of film tourists and other people involved in the film tourism industry over a span of three years, I identified underlying motivations involved in the production and consumption of film tourism. The study found that pre-tour images of Lord of the Rings and its publicity surrounding the making of the films play a significant role in the formation of film tourists' expectations. The emotional relationship towards the films and the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien had motivated film tourists to seek a meaningful and sincere experience. Furthermore, the film and its making as discussed on the DVDs, further publicised myths like the authenticity of the film production itself and the experience of great meaning for one's personal life. Consequently, the study found that most film tourists put a high significance on the sincerity of the relationships within the tour community and with the tour leader and guide(s). The film location visit itself was experienced as highly rewarding but was significantly enhanced by the presence of the tour community ('fellowship'), reenactments and the physical presence on site. This embodiment was crucial for the overall experience as it further authenticated the location visit but also the journey itself as a worthy and spiritual endeavour. It was shown that the New Zealand image of 'green', 'clean' and 'exotic otherness' has been reinforced by multiple media portraits and matches many aspects of the Middle-earth image. All film tourists judged the use of New Zealand for the portrayal of Middle-earth as 'authentic' even if they knew about J.R.R. Tolkien's British background. Furthermore, they judged their film tourism experience as authentic even though the locations were used in a fictional setting. Thus the notions of object authenticity was explored and replaced with the concepts of existential authenticity and sincerity to shift the focus towards the active process of negotiation of authenticity in the tourism experience. To understand tourists' behaviour and motivation, notions of 'spirituality' and 'pilgrimage' were also employed. The study tourists undertook a meaningful and spiritually significant journey that was enhanced through the experience of embodiment and community which suggested parallels between the religious pilgrim and the secular film tourist. Both are on a meaningful journey to distant places and follow scripted guidelines while also creating their own experience. Embodiment played an important role. Furthermore, film tourists sought the community of other believers and were willing to 'follow in the footsteps' of film stars and crew when choosing which film locations and eateries to visit as they sought places that had attained an 'aura'.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">film tourism</field><field name="subject">film-induced tourism</field><field name="subject">movie tourism</field><field name="subject">movie-induced tourism</field><field name="subject">Lord of the Rings</field><field name="subject">Tolkien</field><field name="subject">Whale Rider</field><field name="subject">pilgrimage</field><field name="subject">myths</field><field name="subject">authenticity</field><field name="subject">tourist experience</field><field name="subject">tour guide</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The decision making processes of semi-commercial farmers : a case study of technology adoption in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sambodo, Leonardo A. A. T.</field><field name="description">An exploration of the creation and use of farmers' commonly used "rules of thumb" is required to conceptualize farmers' decision making processes. While farmers face complex situations, particularly when subsistence is an issue, they do appear to use simple rules in their decision making. To date inadequate attention has been given to understanding their reasoning processes in creating the rules, so this study traces the origins of farmers' beliefs, and extracts the decisive and dynamic elements in their decision making systems to provide this understanding. The analysis was structured by using a model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Modifications included recognizing a bargaining process (BP) and other decision stimuli to represent socio-cultural influences and sources of perception, respectively. Two analyses based on the Personal Construct Theory (PCT) and the Ethnographic Decision Tree Modelling (EDTM) were also applied to help elaborate the farmers' cognitive process and actual decision criteria. The method involved interviews in two villages in Lamongan Regency in East Java Province of Indonesia, where the farmers adopted an improved paddy-prawn system ("pandu"). The results highlighted that farmers use rational strategies, and that socio-cultural factors influence decision making. This was represented by interactions between the farmers' perceptions, their bargaining effort, and various background factors. The TPB model revealed that the farmers' perceptions about the potential of "pandu", and the interaction with their "significant others", influenced their intention to adopt "pandu". The farmers appeared to prefer a steady income and familiar practices at the same time as obtaining new information, mainly from their peers. When "pandu" failed to show sufficiently profitable results, most farmers decided to ignore or discontinue "pandu". This became the biggest disincentive to a wide and sustainable adoption. However, the PCT analysis showed that part of this problem also stemmed from the farmers' lack of resources and knowledge. The farmers' restrictive conditions also led them to seek socio-cultural and practical support for their actions. This was highlighted by a bargaining process (BP) that integrated what the farmers had learned, and believed, into their adoption behaviour. The BP also captured the farmers' communication strategies when dealing with "pandu" as its adoption affected resource allocation within the family and required cooperation with neighbours. The PCT and EDTM analyses also confirmed how the BP accommodated different sets of decision criteria to form different adoption behaviours. Such a process indicated the importance of considering the adoption decision and the relevant changes resulting from the farmers' cognition. This provided a more dynamic and realistic description of the farmers' decision-making process than has previously been attempted. Overall, the results suggested that semi-commercial farmers need to know, and confirm, that a new technology is significantly superior to the existing system, and can provide a secure income. The introduction of a new technology should use a participatory approach allowing negotiation, conflict mitigation and the creation of consensus among the relevant parties. This can be supported through better access to knowledge, information and financing. A specific and well-targeted policy intervention may also be needed to accommodate the diversity in the farmers' ways of learning and making decisions. Ways to improve the current analytical approaches are also suggested.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decision</field><field name="subject">adoption</field><field name="subject">semi-commercial farmers</field><field name="subject">planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">bargaining process</field><field name="subject">personal construct</field><field name="subject">decision tree</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of fisheries waste in the diet of Westland Petrels (Procellaria westlandica)</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Amanda N. D.</field><field name="description">Westland petrels Procellaria westlandica breed only near Punakaiki on the West Coast of New Zealand. About 80 km offshore from their breeding colony, New Zealand's largest commercial fishery (for hoki Macruronus novaezelandiae) operates from mid June to early September, coinciding with the Westland petrel's breeding season. It has been assumed that Westland petrels feed extensively on fisheries waste and that this habit has been at least partly responsible for the increase in the Westland petrel population. Some seabird biologists have expressed concern that if a species comes to depend on scavenging at fishing vessels, such a species could experience a food crisis if fishing operations changed in a way that reduced the quantity of waste discharged. The aim of this research was to assess how dependent Westland petrels have become on fisheries waste for food. Diet studies showed that during the hoki fishing season, waste accounts for more than half by weight of the solid food Westland petrels bring back to the colony to feed their chicks. After the hoki season, waste contributes only about a quarter of their diet as birds switch to more natural prey and scavenge a wider variety of fish species presumably from smaller, inshore fishing vessels. Much of the fisheries waste eaten by Westland petrels was flesh which could not be identified using traditional techniques. The electrophoretic technique iso-electric focusing increased the number of fish samples that could be identified and consequently the diet was interpreted differently than it would have been had only traditional diet analysis been used. The survey of Westland petrel distribution off the west coast of the South Island, found that although hoki fishing vessels influence the distribution of Westland petrels, only a small proportion of the Westland petrel population appears to utilise this food resource at any one time. Westland petrels were tracked at sea by VHF radio telemetry and then by satellite tracking. Satellite tracking showed that there is considerable variation in the amount of time Westland petrels spend in the vicinity of fishing vessels. On average, satellite tracked birds spent one third of their time near vessels, but they foraged over much larger areas than that occupied by the West Coast South Island hoki fishing fleet. Although fisheries waste is an important component of the Westland petrel diet, it appears that the situation is one of opportunistic use of a readily available resource, rather than one of dependence. Several features of the Westland petrel's breeding biology and foraging ecology suggest that Westland petrels could compensate for a reduction in waste from the hoki fishery by switching to other sources of waste and increasing their consumption of natural prey. Nevertheless, much remains unanswered concerning the role of fisheries waste in the Westland petrel's diet. In particular, quantifying the waste available to seabirds, and the success of Westland petrels in acquiring that waste compared to other scavenging species, is needed in order to better predict the effect of a reduction in fisheries waste on Westland petrel population size.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Westland petrel</field><field name="subject">Procellaria westlandica</field><field name="subject">hoki</field><field name="subject">Macruronus novaezelandiae</field><field name="subject">fisheries waste</field><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">population</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">iso-electric focusing</field><field name="subject">satellite tracking</field><field name="subject">Geographical Information System</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between shoot and root growth of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants under various environmental stresses</field><field name="creator">Chung, G. C.</field><field name="description">The response of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) plants to various root and shoot environments (solution depth, temperature, ionic strength, nitrogen and calcium level and light intensity) were studied. Cucumber plants were grown in continuously circulating-solution in a heated-glasshouse. Dry weights of leaves, stems and roots, leaf area, leaf number, root length and root number were measured as well as uptake of potassium, calcium and nitrogen. The relationship between shoot and root in terms of functional equilibrium equations was also examined. The results presented show that: 1. Shoot growth of cucumber plants was reduced if grown in solutions of less than 50mm in depth; 2. When roots were grown in shallow solution depths at 1 or 5mm the dry weight allocated to the root increased. The ratio of root number/root length(no./cm) also increased. Lowering solution temperature to 12.5&#177;2.5&#176;C enhanced the production of root number relctive to root length, and 5 and 2% of full strength and 5% of full strength nitrogen level solution stimulated the growth of root length relative to root number; 3. Under low solution temperature treatment leaf number was maintained at the expense of leaf area. Under low total ionic strength and low nitrogen solution, enhanced root length growth was at the expense of leaf area growth; 4. Low solution temperature enhanced the dry weight allocated to the stem relative to the leaf. Low total ionic strength and low nitrogen solution increased the dry weight allocated to the leaf relative to the stem; 5. The specific activity of root, represented by specific absorption rate, increased when the shoot was under light stress and, the specific activity of shoot, represented by unit shoot rate, increased when the root was under nitrogen-stress; 6. The form of equation developed by Thornley (&#8710;M = fm&#8710;W, where &#8710;M is the increment in weight of element M and &#8710;W the increment in total plant dry weight during a time period &#8710;t with fm a constant) showed a better relationship than the equation developed by Davidson [root mass x rate(absorption) &#8733; leaf mass x rate(photosynthesis)] and subsequently used by Hunt in the form of mass ratio(root/shoot) &#8733; l/activity ratio; 7. The equation developed by Chung et al, total plant weight/(leaf number/leaf area) &#8733; total "k"/(root number/root length), where k represents the total contents of elements or compounds, showed a good approximation of the relationship between shoot and root under all the environmental stresses imposed with the exception of calcium uptake. The results support the concept that the activity of the root or shoot in carrying out its function is influenced by the demand created by the opposite organ and appears to be a better assumption than that which proposes that the activity of an organ is solely dependent on its own size.</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.)</field><field name="subject">solution depth</field><field name="subject">solution temperature</field><field name="subject">ionic strength</field><field name="subject">light intensity</field><field name="subject">nitrogen and calcium level</field><field name="subject">shoot</field><field name="subject">root</field><field name="subject">morphology</field><field name="subject">functional equilibrium equations</field><field name="subject">nutrient film technique</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protoplast fusion of Lolium perenne and Lotus corniculatus for gene introgression</field><field name="creator">Raikar, S. V.</field><field name="description">Lolium perenne is one of the most important forage crops globally and in New Zealand. Lotus corniculatus is a dicotyledonous forage that contains valuable traits such as high levels of condensed tannins, increased digestibility, and high nitrogen fixing abilities. However, conventional breeding between these two forage crops is impossible due to their markedly different taxonomic origin. Protoplast fusion (somatic hybridisation) provides an opportunity for gene introgression between these two species. This thesis describes the somatic hybridisation, the regeneration and the molecular analysis of the putative somatic hybrid plants obtained between L. perenne and L. corniculatus. Callus and cell suspensions of different cultivars of L. perenne were established from immature embryos and plants were regenerated from the callus. Of the 10 cultivars screened, cultivars Bronsyn and Canon had the highest percentage of callus induction at 36% each on 5 mg/L 2,4-D. Removal of the palea and lemma which form the seed coat was found to increase callus induction ability of the embryos. Plant regeneration from the callus was achieved when the callus was plated on LS medium supplemented with plant growth regulators at different concentrations. Variable responses to shoot regeneration was observed between the different cultivars with the cv Kingston having the lowest frequency of shoot formation (12%). Different factors affecting the protoplast isolation of L. perenne were investigated. The highest protoplast yield of 10&#215;10&#8310; g&#8315;&#185;FW was obtained when cell suspensions were used as the tissue source, with enzyme combination 'A' (Cellulase Onozuka RS 2%, Macerozyme R-10 1%, Driselase 0.5%, Pectolyase 0.2%), for 6 h incubation period in 0.6 M mannitol. Development of microcolonies was only achieved when protoplasts were plated on nitrocellulose membrane with a L. perenne feeder layer on PEL medium. All the shoots regenerated from the protoplast-derived calli were albino shoots. The highest protoplast yield (7&#215;10&#8310; g&#8315;&#185;FW) of L. corniculatus was achieved from cotyledons also with enzyme combination 'A' (Cellulase Onozuka RS 2%, Macerozyme R-10 1%, Driselase 0.5%, Pectolyase 0.2%), for 6 h incubation period in 0.6 M mannitol. The highest plating efficiency for L. corniculatus of 1.57 % was achieved when protoplasts were plated on nitrocellulose membrane with a L. perenne feeder layer on PEL medium. The highest frequency of shoot regeneration (46%) was achieved when calli were plated on LS medium with NAA (0.1 mg/L) and BA (0.1 mg/L). Protoplast fusion between L. perenne and L. corniculatus was performed using the asymmetric somatic hybridisation technique using PEG as the fusogen. L. perenne protoplasts were treated with 0.1 mM IOA for 15 min and L. corniculatus protoplasts were treated with UV at 0.15 J/cm&#178; for 10 min. Various parameters affecting the fusion percentage were investigated. Successful fusions were obtained when the fusions were conducted on a plastic surface with 35% PEG (3350 MW) for 25 min duration, followed by 100 mM calcium chloride treatment for 25 min. A total of 14 putative fusion colonies were recovered. Shoots were regenerated from 8 fusion colonies. Unexpectedly, the regenerated putative hybrid plants resembled L. corniculatus plants. The flow cytometric profile of the putative somatic hybrids resembled that of L. corniculatus. Molecular analysis using SD-AFLP, SCARs and Lolium specific chloroplast microsatellite markers suggest that the putative somatic hybrids could be L. corniculatus escapes from the asymmetric protoplast fusion process.

It has been assumed that such contact causes chronic stress on dolphin populations. This study examined relatively naive populations of Hector's dolphins and their interaction with various watercrafts. Dolphins in New Zealand have been observed using theodolites and boat-based observations over the last two decades, particularly on the east side of the South Island at Akaroa, which is situated on the coast line of Banks Peninsula. This research was undertaken using shore-based theodolite tracking to observe boat activity around the coast of Lyttelton and Timaru and their associated Harbours. Observations were made mostly over two periods each of six months duration and included the months October through to March during the years 2000-2001 and 2001-2002. Observations made during a third period in 2005 were also incorporated for some of the analyses. Field investigations using a theodolite included more than 376 hours/site/season and recorded dolphin behaviour both with and without the presence of tour boats. Of primary interest were the tours, which ran regular trips to observe Cephalorhynchus hectori in their natural habitat. Hector's dolphins at both Lyttelton and Timaru were consistently observed with particular boat types and not with other types of water craft. Dolphins at Timaru exhibited a greater range of behaviours than those at Lyttelton. Stress-related behaviours such as an increase in swimming speed to open ocean and grouping behaviour were only observed in the presence of boats. Other potential stress behaviours, such as head slaps and repeated tail slaps, were only performed in the absence of boats. Observations implied that some generic dolphin behaviours, which often indicate stressed individuals may not apply to Hector's dolphins, and therefore question the assumption that all dolphin species behave in similar ways. We suggest that low-level tourist boat activity is not placing undue stress on the population. In addition to theodolite observations, tour boat based observations of Hector's dolphin were undertaken and behaviour at each site recorded for a focal animal. Tour boat-based observations concentrated on determining any preference to bow, stern, portside and starboard sides of the vessel. Dolphins consistently showed a preference in direction of approach and departure from tour vessels with a strong tendancy to the bow of the boat, and least with the stern. These results were similar irrespective of site or vessel. Behaviour data were also collected from tour boat vessels over 48 trips/season/site and the data divided into transitional behaviour groups, which included stress behaviours, association / interaction behaviour and neutral behaviour. Behavioural count and time data were collected to reflect the number of times and duration of behaviour occurrence, particularly in relation to transitional behaviours. Determining the presence of stress in Hector's dolphins varied between the data sets and indicated that time is a necessary factor when attempting to determine whether an individual or a general population is genuinely stressed. Quadrant preference and swimming direction in relation to the Black Cat were observed over six years, and both count and time data were collected with regard to behaviour. The results were consistent with preference in quadrant being expressed towards the bow of the boat and least with the stern. The count data suggested no significant impact on Hector's dolphin behaviour in the presence of the Black Cat over time, where time data indicated there was a transition over the years from neutral behaviour in the second year of tour boat activity, to positive behaviour in the third year of boat-activity and finally avoidance behaviour in the seventh year of tour boat activity at Lyttelton Harbour in response to the presence of the Black Cat.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hector&#8217;s dolphin</field><field name="subject">tour boats</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="subject">theodolite</field><field name="subject">boat-based observations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Quaternary landscape evolution and environmental change in Charwell Basin, South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Matthew W.</field><field name="description">Charwell Basin is a 6 km-wide structural depression situated at the boundary between the axial ranges and faulted and folded Marlborough Fault Zone of north-eastern South Island, New Zealand. The basin contains the piedmont reach of the Charwell River, and a series of late Quaternary loess-mantled alluvial terraces and terrace remnants that have been uplifted and translocated from their sediment source due to strike-slip motion along the Hope Fault which bounds the basin to its immediate north. The aim of this study was to provide an interdisciplinary, integrated and holistic analysis of late Quaternary landscape evolution and environmental change in Charwell Basin using terrain analysis, loess stratigraphy, soil chemistry and paleoecological data. The study contributes new understanding of New Zealand landscape and ecosystem responses to regional and global climatic change extending to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, and shows that climatically-forced shifts in biogeomorphic processes play a significant role in lowland landscape evolution. Morphometric analysis of alluvial terraces and terrace remnants of increasing age demonstrated geomorphic evolution through time, with a decrease in extent of original planar terrace tread morphology and an increase in frequency of steeper slopes and convexo-concave land elements. Paleotopographic analysis of a &gt;150 ka terrace mantled by up to three loess sheets revealed multiple episodes of alluvial aggradation and degradation and, subsequent to river abandonment, gully incision prior to and coeval with loess accumulation. Spatial heterogeneity in loess sheet preservation showed a complex history of loess accumulation and erosion. A critical profile curvature range of -0.005 to -0.014 (d&#178;z/dx&#178;, m&#8315;&#185;) for loess erosion derived from a model parameterised in different ways successfully predicted loess occurrence on adjacent slope elements, but incorrectly predicted loess occurrence on an older terrace remnant from which all loess has been eroded. Future analyses incorporating planform curvature, regolith erosivity and other landform parameters may improve identification of thresholds controlling loess occurrence in Charwell Basin and in other South Island landscapes. A loess chronostratigraphic framework was developed for, and pedogenic phases identified in, the three loess sheets mantling the &gt;150 ka terrace. Except for one age, infrared-stimulated luminescence dates from both an upbuilding interfluve loess exposure and colluvial gully infill underestimated loess age with respect to the widespread Kawakawa/Oruanui Tephra (KOT; 27,097 &#177; 957 cal. yr BP), highlighting the need for improvements in the methodology. Onset of loess sheet 1 accumulation started at ca. 50 ka, with a break at ca. 27 ka corresponding to the extended Last Glacial Maximum (eLGM) interstadial identified elsewhere in New Zealand. Loess accumulation through MIS 3 indicates a regional loess flux, and that glaciation was not a necessary condition for loess generation in South Island. Loess accumulation and local alluvial aggradation are decoupled: the youngest aggradation event only covers ~12 kyr of the period of loess sheet 1 accumulation. Older local aggradation episodes could not be the source because their associated terraces are mantled by loess sheet 1. In the absence of numerical ages, the timing of L2 and L3 accumulation is inferred on the basis of an offshore clastic sediment record. The upbuilding phase of loess sheet 2 occurred in late MIS 5a/MIS 4, and loess sheet 3 accumulated in two phases in MIS 5b and late MIS 6. Biogenic silica data were used to reconstruct broad shifts in vegetation and changes in gully soil saturation status. During interglacial/interstadial periods (MIS 1, early MIS 3, MIS 5) Nothofagus-dominated forest covered the area in association with Microlaena spp grasses. Lowering of treeline altitude during glacial/stadial periods (MIS 2, MIS 3, MIS 5b, late MIS 6) led to reduction in forest cover and a mosaic of shrubs and Chionochloa spp, Festuca spp and Poa spp tussock grasses. Comparison of interfluve and gully records showed spatial heterogeneity in vegetation cover possibly related to environmental gradients of exposure or soil moisture. A post-KOT peak in gully tree phytoliths corresponds to the eLGM interstadial, and a shift to grass-dominated vegetation occurred during the LGM sensu stricto. Diatoms indicated the site became considerably wetter from ca. 36 ka, with peak wetness at ca. 30, 25 and 21 ka, possibly due to reduced evapotranspiration and/or increased precipitation from a combination of strengthened westerly winds and increased cloudiness, or strengthened southerly flow and increased precipitation. Human influence after ca. 750 yr BP led to re-establishment of grassland in the area, which deposited phytoliths mixed to 30 cm depth in the soil. A coupled gully colluvial infilling/vegetation record showed that sediment flux during the late Pleistocene was ~0.0019 m&#179; m&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; under a shrubland/grassland mosaic, and Holocene sediment flux was ~0.0034 m&#179; m&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; under forest. This increase of 60% through the last glacial-interglacial transition resulted from increased bioturbation and down-slope soil transport via root growth and treethrow, which formed a biomantle as evidenced by slope redistribution of the KOT. These results contrast with sediment transport rates and processes hypothesised to occur contemporaneously in adjacent mountain catchments. This suggests that intraregional biogeomorphic processes can differ significantly depending on topography and geological substrate, with different landscapes responding in unique ways to the same climate shifts. Analysis of Quaternary terrestrial landscape evolution in non-glaciated mountainous and lowland areas must therefore consider spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sediment fluxes and underlying transport processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscape evolution</field><field name="subject">Quaternary climate change</field><field name="subject">biogeomorphology</field><field name="subject">soil stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">loess</field><field name="subject">aggradation</field><field name="subject">degradation</field><field name="subject">fill terrace</field><field name="subject">fill-cut terrace</field><field name="subject">Kawakawa/Oruanui Tephra</field><field name="subject">luminescence dating</field><field name="subject">phytoliths</field><field name="subject">pedogenesis</field><field name="subject">soil phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and validation of the marine benthic copepod Robertsonia propinqua as a bioindicator to monitor estuarine environmental health</field><field name="creator">Hack, L. A.</field><field name="description">Studies in the USA have reported that species of meiobenthic copepods can be used as bioindicators of sediment-associated contaminants. The main objective of this research project was to develop and validate methods to assess the effects of estuarine pollution, using the marine benthic copepod Robertsonia propinqua as a bioindicator of environmental health in New Zealand intertidal / estuarine areas. Cultures of R. propinqua were set up and maintained in the laboratory and individuals used in 96h acute and full life-cycle chronic bioassays using the pre-selected contaminants atrazine and zinc sulphate. From the 96h acute experiments it was found that the lethal doses at which 50% mortality occurred (LC50) for exposed nauplii and adult individuals were 7.5 mg/L and 31.8 mg/L, respectively for atrazine and 1.7 mg/L and 2.7 mg/L, respectively for zinc sulphate. This indicated that the nauplii life stage was more sensitive than were the adult life stages for exposure to both contaminants. Based on the 'trigger' values reported (atrazine = 0.013 mg/L, zinc = 0.015 mg/L) in the Australian and New Zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality, which provide values at which concentrations of contaminants can occur in the environment before they begin causing effects on aquatic fauna, it is unlikely that the calculated LC50s in the current research will induce biological effects in exposed copepods in the short-term. The calculated LC50 results were then used to further investigate the effects of chronic exposure of sediment-associated contaminants on the complete life-cycle (egg-reproductive adult) of R. propinqua. In a laboratory-based full life-cycle toxicity test, field-collected sediments from polluted sites in the Auckland and Bay of Plenty regions reduced reproductive output (nauplii and copepodite production) of R. propinqua individuals, but the number of males and females, gravid females, clutch size per female and the number of eggs produced were not affected by either the polluted or non-polluted (reference) sediment samples from both field regions. Field investigations of meiofauna community composition in polluted and non-polluted field sites were carried out in 2004 in the Auckland and Bay of Plenty field regions in New Zealand. Greater sediment organic content and a correspondingly deeper redox potential discontinuity layer occurred in all polluted field sites compared with the non-polluted sites. However, species composition could not be used to characterise polluted and non-polluted sites, as there were no dominant taxa which were representative of these sites. The results presented in this thesis indicate that R. propinqua has strong potential to be a good candidate species as a bioindicator of environmental contamination. Furthermore, the full life-cycle toxicity test could be used as a rapid test to detect immediate changes in individual reproduction and development as well as long-term population effects. The technologies developed as part of this research may eventually provide additional tools for commercial environmental consultancies and may compliment existing standard operating procedures for environmental assessments involving pollution of estuarine ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robertsonia propinqua</field><field name="subject">bioindicator</field><field name="subject">environmental health assessment</field><field name="subject">ecological risk assessment</field><field name="subject">atrazine</field><field name="subject">zinc sulphate</field><field name="subject">96h acute and full life-cycle chronic toxicity bioassays</field><field name="subject">water quality guideline values</field><field name="subject">copepod life-cycle</field><field name="subject">copepod culture</field><field name="subject">standard operating procedures</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chains behaving badly : a dynamic model of inter-organisational supply chain exchange behaviour under rational, relational and chaotic paradigms</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Mark M. J.</field><field name="description">Supply chain exchange relationships are complex and sometimes chaotic sociological and organisational phenomena. This complexity is compounded by the boundary spanning necessity of forming supply chain partnerships that are further exacerbated by goal divergence and asymmetric information. One of the main questions for consideration is how these dyadic exchange relationships are maintained and develop over time in response to the various channel behaviours of the actors (the buyer and seller)? In particular, exchange relationships are theorised to be sensitive in some degree to attempts at economic appropriation, and conversely coordinative efforts. Such efforts manifest themselves into the mutually opposing forces broadly labelled as opportunistic and collaborative behavioural paradigms. Drawing from the concepts of Systems and Chaos/Complexity theories, it is theorised that the movement from one form of relational arrangement to another is enacted in a non-linear and dynamic manner with periods of relational equilibrium disrupted by bifurcations resulting in the emergence of new levels of relationship. However, not all exchange relationships are susceptible to constant change, rather, there should be some threshold barrier or relationship inertia that must be overcome before a bifurcation occurs. Yet what is not known is how strong these bonds are to the enactment of opportunistic and collaborative partner behaviours. Hence, 189 manufacturing supply chain relationships were survey-interviewed in order to determine the impact that collaborative and opportunistic behaviours have on supply chain relational movement. The results show that generally exchange relationships do in fact change in response to these enacted behaviours, and that actual levels of supply chain behaviour over a range of 12 variables could be measured. Indeed, the level of opportunistic behaviour experienced by the sample was disturbing. In addition, the level of tolerance (zone of tolerance) for specific behaviours was measured for the first time in the field. Overall, it was found that supply chain exchange relationships do indeed evolve in a non-linear dynamic manner in response to opportunistic and collaborative manoeuvres by the dyadic actors. Finally, these ideas were summarised in the Dynamic Relational Development (DRD) concept that explains how supply chain relationships dynamically change. In addition, the dualistic nature of the collaborative versus opportunistic behaviour choice for exchange actors is tentatively reconciled by the deontological approach of the Supply Chain Citizen theory offered in this research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">supply chain management</field><field name="subject">dynamic</field><field name="subject">exchange</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">movement</field><field name="subject">opportunism</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">relational and rational schools</field><field name="subject">chaos and complexity theory</field><field name="subject">DRD concept</field><field name="subject">Supply Chain Citizen theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The expansion of sustainability through New Economic Space : M&#257;ori potatoes and cultural resilience</field><field name="creator">Lambert, Simon J.</field><field name="description">The return of M&#257;ori land to a productive role in the New Economy entails the innovation and diffusion of technologies relevant to the sustainable development of this land. Sustainable development requires substantive changes to current land and resource use to mitigate environmental degradation and contribute to ecological and sociological resilience. Such innovation is emerging in 'New Economic Space' where concerns for cultural resilience have arisen as political-economic strategies of the New Economy converge within a global economic space. New Economic Space comprises policy, technology and institutional innovations that attempt to influence economic activity, thus directly engaging with local 'place-based' expressions of geohistorically unique knowledge and identity. This thesis approaches contemporary M&#257;ori development from three perspectives. First, by viewing the changing links between ecosystems and communities as examples of innovation diffusion, the evolution of relevant policies, technologies and institutions can be examined for their impact upon M&#257;ori resilience. Second, such innovation diffusion can be described as a form of regional development, acknowledging the integral role of traditional territories in M&#257;ori identity and culture as well as the distinct legislative and governance contexts by which this land is developed. Third, by incorporating the geohistorical uniqueness of M&#257;ori ideas, values and beliefs, standard concepts of political-economy can be reformulated to show an explicit cultural economy &#8211; M&#257;ori Traditional Economic Space &#8211; in which M&#257;ori horticulturalists participate in parallel with the New Economy. Two methods are used in the analysis of the participation by M&#257;ori horticulturalists in New Economic Space. Fuzzy set/Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fs/QCA) allows the rigorous investigation of small-N studies of limited diversity for their partial membership in nominated sets. This thesis uses fs/QCA to organise theoretical and substantive knowledge of each case study to score its membership in agri-food networks, M&#257;ori institutions and post-production strategies, allowing the identification of causal configurations that lead to greater resilience for M&#257;ori growers and their communities. The second method is Actor-Network Theory (ANT) that incorporates elements of nature and society, showing the extensive and dynamic entwinement that exists between the two. ANT describes the enrolment of diverse 'actants' by a range of eco-social institutions and the subsequent translation of the resulting assemblages into resilience strategies. The results of this research first show a 'System of Provision' (SOP) in which M&#257;ori development strategies converge with non-M&#257;ori attempts to expand research and marketing programmes. These programmes seek to implement added-value strategies in supplying novel horticultural products within New Economic Space; parallel 'cultural logics' ensure food is supplied to traditional M&#257;ori institutions according to the cultural logics of M&#257;ori. In addition to this finding, results also show that the participation of M&#257;ori growers in New Economic Space can paradoxically lead to an expansion of the Traditional Economic Space of M&#257;ori. This expansion is not simply contingent upon configurations of policy, technology, and institutional innovations that originate in New Economic Space but is directed by M&#257;ori cultural logics, located in M&#257;ori territories but seeking innovations from an amorphous universal 'core'. The interface between the global New Economy and the localities of a M&#257;ori cultural economy is defined by the 'interrogation' of these innovations, and innovators, through eco-cultural institutions in their diffusion to and from M&#257;ori land, M&#257;ori resources and M&#257;ori people. Within the boundaries of this interrogation border resides a malleable assemblage of actants, enrolled by M&#257;ori as components of resilience strategies, which can lead to the endurance of M&#257;ori culture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori development</field><field name="subject">political economy</field><field name="subject">socio-ecological resilience</field><field name="subject">New Economic Space</field><field name="subject">fs/QCA</field><field name="subject">Actor-Network Theory</field><field name="subject">cultural economy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rhizobium inoculation, cultivar and management effects on the growth, development and yield of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)</field><field name="creator">Kellman, Anthony W.</field><field name="description">Genotypic differences in growth and yield of two common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) cultivars to Rhizobium inoculation and management were investigated. In 2003-04, the two bean cultivars (Scylla and T-49) were combined with three inoculant treatments (strains CC 511 and RCR 3644, and a control of no inoculation), two fertiliser levels (0 and 150 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;) and two irrigation treatments (irrigated and rainfed). There was no nodulation on either cultivar. To further investigate the symbiotic relationship, 16 rhizobial isolates, including the two used in the first field experiment, were combined with the cultivar Scylla and evaluated in a greenhouse. Subsequently, five Rhizobium isolates were chosen for further field evaluation, based on signs of early nodulation in the greenhouse trial. The second field experiment in 2004-05 combined the five inoculant strains (RCR 3644, UK 2, H 20, PRF 81, PhP 17 and a control) with two bean cultivars (Scylla and T-49). In the greenhouse, nodule number varied from 7 (UK 2) to 347 (H 441) nodules plant&#8315;&#185; at 51 DAS and from 13 (UK 1) to 335 (CIAT 899) nodules plant&#8315;&#185; at 85 DAS. In 2004-05, in the field, nodulation was also variable, ranging between 1 and approximately 70 nodules plant&#8315;&#185;, with higher nodules numbers plant&#8315;&#185; being found on cultivar T-49. Of the isolates used in the field, strains H 20, PRF 81 and PhP 17 produced 70, 25 and 12 nodules plant&#8315;&#185; at 70, 40 and 54 DAS respectively. Nodules formed were of various sizes and more than 80 % were pink to dark red in colour denoting the presence of leghaemoglobin and active N fixation. The remaining nodules were either green or white. The importance of selecting an appropriate cultivar for the growing conditions was highlighted in these experiments. Leaf area index, leaf area duration intercepted radiation and final utilisation efficiency were significantly affected by cultivar. In both seasons cv. T-49 reached maturity (dry seed) before Scylla, while unirrigated plants reached green pod maturity seven days before irrigated plants. Plants of cv. Scylla gave a final TDM of 730 g m&#8315;&#178;; compared to the 530 g m&#8315;&#178; produced by T-49. The average growth rate was 7.0 and 5.2 g m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; for Scylla and T-49 respectively (2003-04). Plants receiving 150 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; produced 665 g m&#8315;&#178; TDM which was 12 % more than was produced by unfertilised plants. The application of 150 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; gave an average growth rate of 6.4 g m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; compared to 5.7 g m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; from plants with no N. Inoculation in the field had no significant effect on TDM in both seasons. Temperature affected growth and DM accumulation. Accumulated DM was highly dependent on cumulative intercepted PAR. Air temperatures below the base temperature (10 &#176;C) affected growth in 2004-05, resulting in plants accumulating just 0.24 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PAR during early growth. This increased to 2.26 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PAR when the temperature was increased above the base temperature. There was a strong relationship between LAI and intercepted PAR. A LAI of 4.0-4.5 was required to intercept 90-95 % of incident solar radiation. Cultivar significantly (p &lt; 0.001) affected radiation use efficiency (RUE). Scylla had a RUE of 1.02 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PAR compared to T-49 at 1.18 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PAR. Seed yield was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) affected by cultivar and fertiliser application. Cultivar Scylla produced 467 g m&#8315;&#178; which was 76 % more than T-49, while a 12 % increase in seed yield was observed in N fertilised plants over unfertilised plants. Only cultivar significantly affected HI, while the yield components that had the greatest effect on seed yield were hundred seed weight and pods plant&#8315;&#185;. Inoculation significantly (p&lt; 0.05) affected 100 seed weight (2004-05). Plants inoculated with strain H 20 had the highest 100 seed weight at 25.2 g with cv. Scylla producing larger seeds than T-49. The belief that local environmental conditions play a major role on field survival of bacteria, led to the use of PCR methods to identify field nodulating organisms. Amplification of genomic DNA from parent isolates using primers fC and rD generated a single band for each isolate. Isolates were identified to the species level as either Rhizobium or Agrobacterium, using the highly conserved internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region and are known to nodulate common bean. The DNA extracted from the isolates recovered from nodules of field grown beans gave multiple bands with primers fC and rD. Five distinct banding patterns were observed. All of these were different from those of parent isolates. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that nodules of field grown beans in Canterbury were inhabited by Pseudomonads either alone or in association with other root nodulating organisms. The inability to identify the inoculant strains in nodules of field grown beans does not rule out their infection and nodulating function in the cultivars used. The results suggest the possibility of both Rhizobium and Pseudomonads cohabiting in the nodules of field grown beans. The aggressive nature of Pseudomonads on artificial media, possibly out competing the inoculant rhizobia is proposed, leading to the inability to identify the inoculant strain from the nodules of the field grown beans by PCR methods. The need to identify the nodule forming or nodule inhabiting bacteria in the nodules is necessary to classify the importance of these organisms and their economic benefit to agricultural production. This study also underlines the importance of using PCR methods to gain valuable insights into the ecological behaviour of Rhizobium inoculants and nodule inhabiting organisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizobium</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">common bean</field><field name="subject">nodulation</field><field name="subject">inoculation</field><field name="subject">dry matter accumulation</field><field name="subject">PCR</field><field name="subject">radiation interception</field><field name="subject">primers</field><field name="subject">fC</field><field name="subject">rD</field><field name="subject">agrobacterium</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas species</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of diffusion laws to composting: theory, implications, and experimental testing</field><field name="creator">Chapman, P. D.</field><field name="description">Understanding the fundamentals of composting science from a pragmatic perspective of necessity involves mixtures of different sizes and types of particles in constantly changing environmental conditions, in particular temperature. The complexity of composting is affected by this environmental variation. With so much "noise" in the system, a question arises as to the need to understand the detail of this complexity as understanding any part of composting with more precision than this level of noise is not likely to result in greater understanding of the system. Yet some compost piles generate offensive odours while others don&#8223;t and science should be able to explain this difference. A driver for this research was greater understanding of potential odour, which is assumed to arise from the anaerobic core of a composting particle. It follows that the size of this anaerobic core could be used as an indicator of odour potential. A first step in this understanding is the need to determine which parts of a composting particle are aerobic, from which the anaerobic proportion can be determined by difference. To this end, this thesis uses a finite volume method of analysis to determine the distribution of oxygen at sub-particle scales. Diffusion laws were used to determine the thickness of each finite volume. The resulting model, called micro-environment analysis, was applied to a composting particle to enable determination of onion ring type volumes of compost (called micro-environments) containing substrates (further subdivided into substrate fractions) whose concentrations could be determined to high precision by the application of first-order degradation kinetics to each of these finite volumes. Determination of the oxygen concentration at a micro-environment's inner boundary was achieved by using the St&#281;pniewski equation. The St&#281;pniewski model was derived originally for application to soil aeration and enables each micro-environment to have its own oxygen uptake rate and diffusion coefficient. This first version of micro-environment analysis was derived from the simpler solution to diffusion laws, based on the assumption of non-diffusible substrate. It was tested against three sets of experimental data with two different substrates: Particle size trials using dog sausage as substrate &#8211; where the peak composting rate was successfully predicted, as a function of particle size. Temperature trials using pig faeces and a range of particle sizes &#8211; the results showed the potential of micro-environment analysis to identify intriguing temperature effects, in particular, a different temperature effect (Q10) and fraction proportion was indicated for each substrate fraction. Smaller particle sizes, and possibly outward diffusion of substrate confounded a clear experimental signal. Diffusion into a pile trials which showed that the time course of particles deeper in the pile could be predicted by the physics of oxygen distribution. A fully computed prediction would need an added level of computational complexity in micro-environment analysis, arising from there being two intertwined phases, gas phase and substrate (particle) phase. Each phase needs its own micro-environment calculations which can not be done in isolation from each other. Unexplainable parts of the composting time course are likely to be partly explained by the outward diffusion of substrate towards the inward-moving oxygen front. Although the possibility of alternative electron acceptors can not be discounted as a partial explanation. To test the theory, a new experimental reactor was developed using calorimetry. With an absolute sensitivity of 0.132 J hr-1 L-1 and a measurement frequency of 30 minutes, the reactor was able to detect the energy required to humidify the input air, and "see" when composting begins to decline as oxygen is consumed. Optimisation of the aeration pumping frequency using the evidence from the data was strikingly apparent immediately after setting the optimum frequency. Micro-environment analysis provides a framework by which several physical effects can be incorporated into compost science.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-environment analysis</field><field name="subject">diffusion</field><field name="subject">moving boundary</field><field name="subject">composting</field><field name="subject">composting science</field><field name="subject">calorimetry</field><field name="subject">reactor</field><field name="subject">waste treatment</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">rate constant</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291101 Environmental engineering modelling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A feminist appraisal of the experience of embodied largeness : a challenge for nursing : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carryer, Jennifer B</field><field name="description">To be a fat woman is to experience a prolonged, personal battle with the body.  The battle is enacted in a social context which is the site of remarkable consensus about the personal culpability of fat people for their bodily largeness; for women in particular the sanctions are especially powerful.  In this research nine large women have engaged in a prolonged dialogue about the experience of being 'obese'.  In the course of a feminist research endeavour, with a researcher who is similarly positioned, they have both contributed to and gained from a project which illuminates the experience of largeness alongside a critical examination of the discourses which shape body size.This dissertation critiques a dominant medical discourse which ignores conflicting research and supports a narrow view of health by simplistically linking increased body weight with poor health outcomes.  Such is the hegemonic power of medicine that an examination of both nursing and popular literature in the area of study, reveals wide-spread acceptance of the notion that to be thin is to be healthy and virtuous, and to be fat is to be unhealthy and morally deficient.  For nursing, the unquestioning obedience to medical teaching, raises serious questions about nursing's autonomy and separateness from medicine. Nurses have perpetuated an unhelpful and reductionist approach to their care of large women, in direct contradiction to nursing's supposed allegiance to a holistic approach to health care.  Current strictures on women's body size and continued support for reduction dieting leave large women with the choice between two binary opposites; to diet or not to diet.  Either choice has consequences which are traumatic and not health promoting.  The experience of largeness emerges as a socially constructed disability in which many women are denied the opportunity to be fully healthy.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">body size</field><field name="subject">embodiment</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">medicalisation</field><field name="subject">321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using computers to facilitate formative assessment of open-ended written assignments : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jun</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an e-learning solution to facilitate formative assessment of electronically submitted open-ended written assignments.It is widely accepted that formative assessment is highly beneficial to student leaning. A number of researchers are active in developing specialized approaches and software systems for assisting formative assessment of student work. However, no comprehensive e-learning solution exists for facilitating formative assessment of students' open-ended written work. The project presented in this thesis has developed a new approach for using computers to facilitate formative assessment of electronically submitted open-ended written assignments.Based on the literature review of the education theories around formative assessment and current computer software technologies, this project has developed three principles for e-learning support for formative assessment of open-ended written assignments:1. It needs to facilitate all the activities that are potentially required for formative assessment of student assignments (for example, the creation of assessment criteria, the submission of assignments, and the analysis of the assessment results), not only the marking activity to create feedback on assignments.2. It needs to provide an onscreen marking tool which enables human markers to mark open-ended written assignments in an intuitive and efficient way by replicating their paper-based assessment approaches.3. It needs to provide a generic solution for facilitating formative assessment of open-ended written assignments from all disciplines, not a limited solution restricted to some specific domains (for example, computers science or business courses).Based on these principles, a specification of an e-learning system for facilitating formative assessment of open-ended written assignment was developed and a system was implemented accordingly.

Museums exist within a post-modern milieu that demands a more democratic approach to defining their cultural and educational role within society. Over the last decade in particular, art museums, criticised for being elitist and insular within their communities, have been challenged to be more inclusive, accessible and relevant to their local communities.The literature suggests that a review of the core mission and the culture of museums is required to provide the catalyst for change. However, there is little evidence or few models offered as to how such re-visioning could be implemented. New Zealand art museums have been slow in responding to the issues, or to conducting research involving either their visitors or their communities. These emergent issues provided the context for this study, which is focused on the creation and reception of a community based exhibition within a contemporary regional art museum.This exhibition project brought together community participants and established artists, and the study evaluates the responses of the exhibition creators and the exhibition audience. In line with action research methodology, evaluation surveys and observational data were collected during the distinct phases of the project and resulted in a number of findings that have implications for regional art museums.The findings from this present study indicate that curators working alongside the community with an action research methodology, while developing exhibition projects, can produce positive outcomes for the participants, the audience and the museum. Creative partnerships can be established that enhance life-long-learning opportunities and contribute to the relevance of museums within their communities.The present study also proposes that museums re-vision their mission to become 'learning organisations' (Senge, 1994, 2000) and provides a model that could be appropriate for museums intent on enriching their organisational culture and enhancing their significance and profile within their community.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art museums</field><field name="subject">exhibitions</field><field name="subject">419900 Other Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trauma and recovery in Janet Frame's fiction; a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Faculty of Graduate Studies (Department of English), The University of British Columbia.</field><field name="creator">Lawn, Jennifer</field><field name="description">Focusing on four novels by Janet Frame in dialogue with texts by Freud, Zizek, Lacan, and Silverman, my project theorizes trauma as the basis for both an ethical and an interpretive practice.  Frame's fiction develops a cultural psychology, showing how the factors of narcissistic fantasy and the incapacity to mourn contribute to physical and epistemic aggression committed along divides of ethnicity, gender, and linguistic mode of expression.  Employing trauma as a figure for an absolute limit to what can be remembered or known, I suggest that reconciliation with whatever is inaccessible, lacking, or dead within an individual or collective self fosters a non-violent relation with others.  	I begin by querying the place of "catharsis" within hermeneutic literary interpretation, focusing on the construction of Frame within the New Zealand literary industry.  With Erlene's adamantine silence at its centre, Scented Gardens for the Blind (1964) rejects the hermeneutic endeavour, exemplified by Patrick Evans' critical work on Frame, to make a text "speak" its secrets.  My readings of Intensive Care (1970) and The Adaptable Man (1965) address inter-generational repetitions of violence as the consequences of the failure to recognise and work through the devastations of war.  The masculine fantasy of totality driving the Human Delineation project in Intensive Care has a linguistic corollary in Colin Monk's pursuit of the Platonic ideality of algebra, set against Milly's "degraded" punning writing.  In The Adaptable Man, the arrival of electricity ushers in a new perceptual rgime that would obliterate any "shadow" of dialectical negativity or internal difference.  	The thesis ends with a swing toward conciliation and emotional growth.  The homosexual relationship depicted in Daughter Buffalo (1972) offers a model of transference, defined as a transitional, productive form of repetition that opens Talbot to his ethnic and familial inheritance.

Leigh</field><field name="description">Rapid technological change and increasing traffic volumes worldwide are adding to the safety challenges for air traffic control. The night shift has traditionally been a period of low workload and work practices have evolved to reflect this. Thus, despite the exemplary safety record, there is a need to consider further systemic defences for maintaining performance and safety on the night shift. One possible strategy is the provision of a scheduled nap at work. In order to investigate the consequences of a scheduled nap on the night shift, 28 operational air traffic controllers were monitored across four roster cycles. Each roster cycle included one of two night shifts. Air traffic controllers were given a nap opportunity on one night shift of each type, and did not nap on the other. Information on the timing, quantity, and quality of sleep during the work week and days off was collected using actigraphy, and supported with logbook data. Sleep during the nap was measured using polysomnography, and the EEG and EOG were further utilised to determine neurophysiological alertness over the latter part of the night shift. Reaction time performance was measured three times across the night shift (beginning, middle, and end) with the psychomotor vigilance test.Actigraphy data indicated that the backward, rapidly-rotating work schedule of air traffic controllers resulted in a progressive loss of sleep across the work week. The reduction in sleep lead to an increasing cumulative sleep debt that was at a maximum prior to the night shift. This sleep debt was not related to reaction time performance at the end of the night shift, but was found to influence neurophysiological alertness.It was determined that the large majority of air traffic controllers were able to sleep during the scheduled 40 minute nap opportunity. However, the latency to sleep onset was long, the sleep short, and of relatively poor quality. Circadian and homeostatic factors increased the likelihood of entry into, and waking from, slow wave sleep (SWS). They were also found to influence reaction time performance and neurophysiological alertness. More variable performance and lowered alertness were seen at the end of the later starting (and finishing) night shift, possibly due to the combined influence of circadian and time-on-task factors. Homeostatic variables had less influence on performance at the end of the night shift, but greater acute sleep loss and higher cumulative sleep debts were related to increased neurophysiological sleepiness.performance and greater neurophysiological alertness in a dose-dependent manner, with even small amounts of stage 1 sleep effecting a performance improvement. Performance improvement was consistent across a range of reaction time measures and consistent improvements were also evident in the neurophysiological data, with the occurrence of SEMs declining, and lower spectral power evident in all frequency bands and single frequencies.These findings clearly demonstrate that a minimal quantity of sleep benefits the performance and alertness of air traffic controllers despite the "noise" of a field setting, thus providing a link between laboratory studies of napping and the actual work environment. The findings also fully support management endorsing a 40 minute napping opportunity for air traffic controllers working the night shift.The short nap sleep had no measurable effect on sleep subsequent to the night shift. However, the amount of sleep obtained in the nap was related to improved reaction time.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sleep</field><field name="subject">Alertness</field><field name="subject">Napping</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Air Traffic Control</field><field name="subject">Shiftwork</field><field name="subject">380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advertising and the market orientation of political parties contesting the 1999 and 2002 New Zealand general election campaigns : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Claire Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes an alternative way of establishing a link between market orientation and electoral success, by focusing on market orientation as a message instead of as a management function. Using interpretive textual analysis the thesis examines the advertising messages of the highest polling political parties for evidence of voter orientation and competitor orientation in the 1999 and 2002 New Zealand general election campaigns. Relating manifest market orientation to a number of statistical indicators of electoral success the thesis looks for plausible associations between the visual manifestation of market orientation in political advertisements and parties' achievement of their party vote goals in the 1999 and 2002 elections. It offers party-focused explanations for electoral outcomes to complement existing voter-centric explanations, and adds another level of scholarly understanding of recent electoral outcomes in New Zealand.While the thesis finds little association between demonstration of competitor orientation in political advertisements and electoral success, it finds a plausible relationship between parties that demonstrated a voter orientation in their political advertisements and goal achievement. The parties that achieved their party vote goals in 1999 and 2002 tended to demonstrate an affinity for their target voter groups by showing images of voters and their environments and images of party leaders interacting with voters. They demonstrated concern for the satisfaction of the needs of existing voters by using words of togetherness and proving they had met their previous promises. They did not change their policy or leadership messages dramatically between campaigns. There was a visual consistency to their television, print and billboard advertising messages which rendered the messages easy to recognise and remember. They were clear about what they were offering in exchange for the party vote and recognised the need to offer something in addition to previous offerings in order to attract new voters.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political marketing</field><field name="subject">political advertising</field><field name="subject">market orientation</field><field name="subject">visual analysis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand elections</field><field name="subject">political communication</field><field name="subject">360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provision at the interface : the M&#257;ori mental health contracting experience : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Health at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boulton, Amohia Frances</field><field name="description">New Zealand's mental health performance and monitoring framework is a complex and evolving one. Its initial development occurred at a time when it was taken for granted that mainstream understandings of health and mainstream systems of service delivery would not only be appropriate for all New Zealanders, but would also service the needs of all New Zealanders. Latterly however there has been an acknowledgment that a wholly different understanding of health and health care has existed in this country; the worldview understood and shared by tangata whenua. This thesis uses a theoretical framework devised specifically for this research to investigate the experience of Maori mental health providers as they contract to provide mental health services for the Crown; to ascertain whether Maori mental health providers deliver outside of their contracts; and to examine the role multiple accountabilities play in contracting. The theoretical framework, the "Maori research paradigm net" is inclusive of both the kaupapa Maori and Maori centred approaches, moving beyond the traditional dichotomy that frames Maori health research and allowing the researcher the freedom to select and use the best and most appropriate research tools from both traditional social science research practices, and from Maori culture and tikanga, to answer the research question posed. The thesis concludes that Maori mental health providers deliver mental health services at the interface between two philosophical viewpoints or worldviews: that of the Maori community in which they are located and to whom they provide services; and that of the funder, from whom they obtain resources to enable them to deliver services. As a consequence of working at the interface, Maori providers regularly and routinely work outside the scope of their contracts to deliver mental health services which are aligned with those values and norms enshrined in Maori culture. To adequately acknowledge and validate the beneficial extra-contractual provision which occurs as a result of delivering mental health services at the interface, and prevent less desirable provision, a more responsive contracting environment and a performance measurement framework, which integrates both worldviews and which takes account of the multiple accountabilities that Maori providers manage, is required.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">contracting</field><field name="subject">third sector</field><field name="subject">health services</field><field name="subject">321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers and children learning together : developing a community of learners in a primary classroom : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Sewell, Alison Mary</field><field name="description">This study investigates the development of a community of learners by observing the changes in teachers' and children's participation in four Year 3 / 4 classrooms. The study also explores the teachers' and children's perspectives of learning and teaching and the impact of these on the development of a community of learners. Factors enabling and constraining this developmental process are also identified. These research foci respond to a synthesis of research revealing the importance of teachers and children learning together in cohesive learning communities (Alton-Lee, 2003); a sociocultural approach that is uncommon in New Zealand primary classrooms.Sociocultural theory also informs the generation, analysis and presentation of data. Participant observations, sustained conversations and interviews with the teachers and target children were used to generate data across three cycles of collaborative action research over one school year. Analyses of these data were made by observing the teachers' and the children's transformation of participation through Rogoff's (2003) personal, interpersonal and institutional lenses. The results of this analysis process are presented according to the lens through which the transformation was observed.The findings showed a community of learners as comprising reciprocal connections across cognitive, social, emotional, spiritual and physical dimensions. Transformations of the teachers' and the children's participation in these five reciprocal connections were observed as evidence that a community of learners was developing. These new forms of participation in the classroom shaped, and were shaped by, new identities as learners and teachers, new perspectives about learning and teaching, as well as new culturally authorised values and practices for learning together. Multiple factors constrained the development of a community of learners. The most pervasive constraint was the persistence of teachers' and children's traditional perspectives that prevented understanding of the reciprocity and responsivity of shared activity. A range of factors also enabled the development of a community of learners. The opportunity for professional dialogu in this collaborative action research most enabled the teachers' to develop a community of learners in the classroom: the opportunity for guided participation with teachers and peers in shared classroom activity most enabled the children to learn together.These findings reveal the demanding, complex and mutually constituting nature of developing a community of learners in a primary classroom. The transformation of participation observed in this study provides evidence of the positive contributions sociocultural theory can make to both teachers' and to children's learning. Implications based on these findings are considered for teachers, children, researchers and education providers who together share responsibility for developing and sustaining a community of learners as accepted instructional practice in primary classrooms.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sociocultural theory</field><field name="subject">community of learners</field><field name="subject">classroom learning</field><field name="subject">transformation of participation</field><field name="subject">primary teaching</field><field name="subject">330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Going public : New Zealand art museums in the 1970s : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Museum Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">McCredie, Athol</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the reputation the 1970s have as a renaissance era for New Zealand public art galleries.It does this by considering the formation and development of galleries in the period as well as their approaches. Public and community involvement, energy, innovation, activism, and engagement with contemporary New Zealand art are key areas of approach investigated since increases in each are associated with galleries in the seventies.The notion of a renaissance is also particularly associated with provincial galleries. In order to examine this idea in detail three "provincial" galleries are taken as case studies. They are the (then named) Dowse Art Gallery, Govett-Brewster Art Gallery and Manawatu Art Gallery.The seventies are revealed as a "culture change" era for public art galleries in New Zealand. New ones were founded, many were rebuilt or substantially altered, and there was a shift from the rule of the amateur to that of the professional. The majority of existing galleries went from being static institutions with few staff, neglected collections, and unchanging exhibitions, to become much more publicly oriented and professionally run operations. Moreover, while change occurred across nearly all institutions, it tended to be led from the provinces.Several reasons are suggested for the forward-looking nature of the three case study galleries. One is that they reflected the energy and flexibility that goes with new, small organisations. Another is that all three existed in cities with little appreciation of art and culture and so had to strenuously prove themselves to gain community acceptance and civic support.Other galleries, particularly the metropolitans, are shown to have followed the lead of the progressive focus institutions. Influencing factors on changes in all New Zealand galleries are therefore also sought. They include the growth in new, well educated, sophisticated, and internationally-aware audiences; greater production and public awareness of New Zealand art; interest in exploring a New Zealand identity; world-wide revolutionary social changes in the '60s and '70s; and increased government funding for building projects.The changes that took place in New Zealand art galleries in the 1970s are shown to sit within the wider contexts of increasing trends towards public orientation by museums internationally, both before and during the decade, and in New Zealand since the seventies. However, the very notion of public orientation is also suggested to be historically relative and, ultimately, politically driven.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art museums</field><field name="subject">art galleries</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">1970s</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">provincial</field><field name="subject">419900 Other Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge creation : a study of consulting practice in corporate governance : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Peirano-Vejo, Maria Elisa</field><field name="description">The management consulting industry has been growing exponentially during the last two decades influencing the relationships between business schools, corporations and universities, achieving a significant role as a modern "knowledge creator". This thesis studies the process of knowledge creation undertaken by management consultants. The academic mode of creating knowledge as described by Kuhn (1996) was used to direct this exploration of consultants as a knowledge creating community. The purpose of using the scientific method of knowledge creation is not to compare or to judge consulting knowledge, but to use it as a way of entry to explore consultants' practices. In a complementary way to Kuhn's core concepts, a brief Foucauldian overview identified concepts like inclusion and exclusion, discourse and the notion of practices, which are used in the analysis. An empirical research was conducted focusing specifically on a group of practicing consultants in New Zealand. Thirteen consultants who specialize in corporate governance advice were interviewed. Corporate governance was chosen as a field of advice because it is a clearly separable area of management consulting. In this study, the categories of community and paradigm served as a point of entry to explore knowledge creation practices. The data was analyzed qualitatively in search for evidence of community belonging and patterns in consultants' knowledge creation practices. It has been found that consultants, in spite not having a formal regulating professional body, behave as a professional community that has entry requirements, exit procedures and credentials for belonging. Consultants define their identities in the intersection of overlapping communities, which sometimes include their former educational backgrounds, their professions and their current practice. Research findings show that consultants in governance share a paradigm, which trascend particular consulting firms and reach a larger group of consultants. This paradigm has quality control processes such as reputation and re-engagement, and common methods in dealing with governance problems. In addition, in terms of the body of knowledge shared, there are certain factors that determine the value of that knowledge for consultants such as novelty, commercial value, utility and accessibility.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consultants</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">management consulting</field><field name="subject">community of consultants</field><field name="subject">Kuhn</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of granulation processes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematical Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rynhart, Patrick Reuben</field><field name="description">Granulation is an industrial process where fine particles are bound together into larger granules. The process has numerous applications including the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and the production of cosmetics, chemicals, detergents and fertilisers. This thesis studies aspects of wet granulation which involves the application of a viscous binder, usually in the form of a spray, to an agitated bed of powder particles. Individual powder particles may adhere together, joined by small quantities of binder fluid called liquid bridges. By a process of collision and adherence additional particles may join the newly formed agglomerates. Agglomerates may also coalesce together which is a process that leads to granule formation. On the completion of this process, granules are typically dried.This thesis studies wet granulation on three different levels. First, micro-level investigations of liquid bridges between two and three particles are performed. For the two-particle case, the fluid profile of static (stationary) and dynamic (moving) liquid bridges is investigated. For the static case, a numerical solution to the Young-Laplace equation is obtained; this relates the volume of binder fluid to liquid bridge properties such as the inter-particle force. An analytic solution is also obtained, providing the liquid bridge profile in terms of known mathematical functions. For both solutions, the radii of the (spherical) primary particles may be different. The dynamic case is then studied using the Navier-Stokes equations with the low Reynolds number approximation. The motion of the approaching particles is shown to be damped by the viscosity of the liquid bridge. Static liquid bridges between three equally sized primary particles are then studied. Symmetry of the problem is used to obtain a numerical solution to the Young-Laplace equation. Liquid bridge properties are calculated in terms of the binder fluid volume. Experimental agreement is provided.Secondly, a model to estimate the stickiness (fractional wet surface area) of agglomerates is proposed. Primary particles are approximated as spheres and are added one at a time in a closely packed arrangement. The model includes parameters to control the inter-particle separation distance and the fluid saturation state. Computational geometry is used to obtain results which relate the number of particles and the volume of binder fluid to the stickiness of the agglomerates.Finally, a population balance model for wet granulation is developed by extending an earlier model to incorporate the effects of binder fluid. Functions for the inter-particle collision rate and drying rate are proposed, including functions which are derived from the geometric model, described above, for the case of maximum particle consolidation. The model is solved numerically for a range of coalescence kernels and results are presented which show the effect of binder volume and the drying rate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">granulation</field><field name="subject">agglomeration</field><field name="subject">population balance modelling</field><field name="subject">liquid bridges</field><field name="subject">coalescence</field><field name="subject">computational geometry</field><field name="subject">240500 Classical Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">City revealed : the process and politics of exhibition development : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Museum Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Daniel Charles Patrick</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which the process of exhibition development and the politics this involves affects the practice of history in the museum. It does this by establishing the broad parameters of history practice in the museum and places this in relation to academic practice, focusing on the New Zealand context and specifically upon Auckland War Memorial Museum. From this basis the thesis examines the development of City exhibition at Auckland Museum as a large-scale museum history exposition. The development process for this exhibition was created with the aim of changing the traditional Museum approach so as to create a more engaging and scholarly history exhibition than is traditional. At the same time however, there was also an aim of retaining the appearance of the traditional Museum within this programme of change. These aims were to be met by the innovation of the collaboration between an academic historian and the Museum's practitioners in the development process.The research is based upon a detailed investigation of the roles played by the exhibition team members and the decisions, negotiations and compromises that they made through the development process. Beginning with their original intentions and concepts for the exhibition its metamorphosis into the exhibition as it was installed in the Museum gallery is traced. Emphasis is placed on the resonance that the various decisions and changes carried into the finished exhibition. The findings indicate that the Museum's traditions of developing and displaying knowledge exerted a strong conservative effect over the exhibition development in conflict with the programme of change. This conservatism vied with the authorial intentions of the exhibition development team. As a result of this influence the exhibition developed leant towards the conventional. The unexpectedly orthodox outcome resulted from the absence of critical museological practice. The thesis argues that although Auckland Museum had undergone extensive restructuring, including the introduction of new exhibition development processes and a new outlook as an organisation, the conception of history in the Museum had not changed. Ultimately this precluded that the practice of history in the institution would advance through the revised exhibition development process. However, the development of City did help achieve the updating of social history in the Museum and remains a platform upon which a more critical approach to the past can be built.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">museums</field><field name="subject">exhibitions</field><field name="subject">exhibition development</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Humanitarian directed violence in Afghanistan : neutrality and humanitarian space : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Philosophy in the Institute of Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gifford, Andrew George Cameron</field><field name="description">The increased violence towards humanitarian workers represents an insidious trend throughout Afghanistan. Humanitarian workers have become legitimised targets since the 2001 US led invasion of Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom.  The increased identification of NGOs with Western military forces and the Afghan government makes the aid community a target by association, whether it is a real or perceived association by the belligerents. Neutrality for NGOs in Afghanistan has been lost. Overwhelmingly, authors and aid practitioners make clear statements about NGOs being legitimised for violence due to the perception of complicity, propagated by either the armed forces themselves or Coalition political leaders. However, army officers involved in the civilian-military relationship are dismissive of the NGOs plight and believe the issue of NGO neutrality to be overplayed.  Indeed the Coalition&#8217;s Provincial Reconstruction Teams and the NATO commander in Afghanistan believe that the lack of co-ordination or pooling of NGOs&#8217; resources with the military or one another is an impediment to development and improving the security in Afghanistan.  The Taliban have gained de facto military control over a growing number of provinces, emanating from the South with humanitarian space in that environment diminished so as to be non-existent. The civilian-military relationship is not responsible for the loss of humanitarian space in its entirety. Opium production, warlord-ism, banditry, corruption, conflict of cultures, religion, and external funding of terrorism marry to produce a uniquely hostile environment not conducive to humanitarian intervention. The lack of heterogeneity between what NGOs agree is acceptable collusion in a civilian-military context also makes it unlikely that accepted operating procedures will be adopted by the civilian humanitarian community as a whole.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Afghanistan</field><field name="subject">Non-governmental Organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' perceptions of the formative potential of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of PhD in Education</field><field name="creator">Rawlins, Peter Leslie Charles</field><field name="description">Research evidence suggests that appropriate use of formative assessment promotes effective learning. Improved learning occurs when assessment is viewed as integral to learning, and when it is supported by coherent assessment systems. Although assessment systems designed primarily around the formative purpose can provide both formative and summative information, a tension exists in practice between the summative and formative purposes of assessment. Using a theoretical framework developed by Sadler (1989), this research project investigated whether New Zealand&#8217;s new secondary school Standards-Based Assessment qualification&#8212;the National Certificate Educational Achievement (NCEA)&#8212;has the potential to satisfy both summative and formative purposes of assessment in mathematics. Theorising from a contemporary sociocultural perspective of learning, this project recognised the situated nature and interpersonal dimension of knowledge, and the impact of the social environment in promoting and directing learning. Theorising from this perspective offered opportunities to examine classroom assessment practices from a new perspective. To date, insufficient attention has been paid to the &#8216;students&#8217; voice&#8217; concerning educational matters that directly affect them. Given the situated nature of students&#8217; engagement with formative practices a case study approach was used to investigate students&#8217; perceptions of the formative potential of NCEA mathematics assessment tasks. Three Y12 mathematics classes from an urban secondary school formed the case study singularity for this study. Focus group interviews with nine students were conducted across the year, complemented by classroom observations, a focus group interview with the teachers, and a quantitative questionnaire with all students in each of the three Year 12 mathematics classes. An examination of the philosophical and structural design of NCEA revealed a strong potential for it to serve a duality of both formative and summative purpose of assessment. However the formative potential of NCEA was yet to be fully realised in the case study classrooms. Students&#8217; underdeveloped knowledge of assessment criteria effectively reduced the potential for students&#8217; independent use of self assessment strategies. This project also identified that teachers and students held differing views on preferred feedback practices. The teachers perceived that students did not read written feedback, and this perception significantly influenced the amount of written feedback that they offered to students. In contrast, students clearly displayed that they read, valued and used scaffolded written feedback to improve their learning. While the teachers preferred to offer oral feedback, students preferred to engage with their peers to use feedback to develop corrective strategies and deepen learning. The project has made a number of practical and theoretical suggestions to improve students&#8217; understandings of the assessment criteria they are working towards, and to more effectively integrate the collaborative use of formative feedback into students&#8217; learning experiences. In particular, it has suggested two additional perspectives on the development and use of formative assessment in a sociocultural learning environment. Firstly, that students&#8217; knowledge of the role of formative assessment is socially and contextually situated, and develops through the social interactions that occur in the classroom. Secondly, the potential exists for formative assessment practices to stimulate collaborative learning opportunities within communities of practice.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NCEA</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">secondary education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330109 Assessment and evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The political ecology of the Japanese paper industry</field><field name="creator">Penna, Ian</field><field name="description">The Japanese paper and paperboard industry has grown to be one of the largest in the world. It manufactures a range of products for sale primarily within Japan, and consumes organic fibre for these products from dispersed domestic and foreign forests, plantations and cities. This dissertation examines the links between the development and structure of the industry and its use of papermaking fibre. It takes a political ecology perspective and uses an industrial structure/consumption-production chain approach to show how the industry&#8217;s development and structure continue to depend on company control over fibre flows and the restructuring of products, product distribution and manufacture, the fibre supply chain and fibre resources. As with the modern global paper/board industry, the recent growth of the Japanese industry has been characterised by cycles of capacity expansion, market collapse, excess capacity and low prices and profits. Manufacturers and general trading companies involved in the industry have tried to support growth in the use of paper/board and counter these cycles by restructuring production, distribution, ownership and fibre supply. This restructuring helps protect the flow of fibre through the industry and concentrated it in particular companies. Obtaining increasing quantities of suitably-priced fibre has been at the base of the industry&#8217;s development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political ecology, Japan, pulp, paper, paperboard, industry, pulpwood, woodchips, waste paper, recovered fibre, recycling, Daishowa, Oji, Nippon, Mitsubishi, Daio, Chuetsu, environmental charter, general trading companies, industry structure, papermaking, Alpac, MITI, Harris-Daishowa, DMI, Lubicon, Alaska Pulp Co.</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2426</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of neural connectivity by the Epha4 receptor tyrosine kinase</field><field name="creator">Coonan, Jason Ross</field><field name="description">Interactions between the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and their ligands, the ephrins, are required for the normal development and maintenance of many patterns of connectivity within the nervous system. Eph receptors and ephrins are expressed widely throughout both the developing and mature nervous system where they function as important regulators of cell migration and axon guidance. The studies presented in this thesis examine the role of one particular member of the Eph receptor family, EphA4, in regulating mechanisms that underlie the development and maintenance of certain neural connections within the nervous system. This thesis demonstrates that the EphA4 receptor is expressed within specific regions of the developing and mature nervous system, some of which are associated with the control of locomotor activity. Consistent with these observations are the locomotor defects exhibited by animals with a targeted disruption of the EphA4 gene. These animals exhibit abnormal bilateral limb movements and have severe disruptions of a number of major axonal pathways. One of these disrupted axonal pathways, the corticospinal tract (CST), is a particularly important mediator of locomotor activity. This thesis reveals that EphA4 is expressed on the axons that comprise the CST. It demonstrates that although EphA4 is not required for the initial development of the CST, repulsive interactions between EphA4-bearing CST axons and ephrinB3, a ligand for EphA4 that is expressed at the midline of the spinal cord, appear to prevent CST axons from aberrantly recrossing the spinal midline during development.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">axon guidance, cell migration, Eph receptor, ephrin, corticospinal tract, spinal motoneuron, topographic positioning, sciatic nerve, neural progenitor</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2388</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/2388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fertility-and menopause-related information needs of young women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Thewes, Belinda, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: The use of chemotherapy and endocrine therapies in the treatment of pre-menopausal women with breast cancer may result in menopausal symptoms, permanent infertility or the need to delay pregnancy.  This series of studies investigates the fertility- and menopause-related information needs of pre-menopausal women with a diagnosis of early breast cancer (Studies 1 and 2) and the benefits women need to make undergoing adjuvant endocrine therapies worthwhile (Study 3). Method: Study 1 is a qualitative study of 24 women and Study 2 a survey study amongst 228 women.  Study 3 included a subset of 102 women from the sample involved in Study 2 who had been treated with endocrine therapies for a minimum of three months.  To be eligible, women had to be aged 40 years or younger (Study 2 and 3) when diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, and be 6-60 months post-diagnosis at the time of participation.  For Study 2, participants completed a mailed self-report questionnaire that included a fertility- and menopause-related information needs survey, and standardized measures of distress, quality-of-life, menopausal symptoms and information preferences. For Study 3, participants were asked to complete a face-to-face interview. Results: Study 1 showed that many women thought that the information they had received in the past about fertility and menopausal symptoms was either insufficient or unavailable.  Some women felt that, while information on fertility and menopause issues had not been paramount at the time of diagnosis, it became increasingly important after diagnosis. Study 2 showed that 71% of participants discussed fertility-related issues with a health professional as part of their breast cancer treatment and 86% discussed menopause-related issues. Consultation with a fertility or menopause specialist was the most preferred method of obtaining this information. Study 3 demonstrated that the majority of participants considered adjuvant endocrine therapy worthwhile for a 2% absolute gain in survival rates and for a 6-month gain in life expectancy.  Conclusions: The results of this series of studies suggest that younger women have unmet needs for fertility- and menopause-related information.  Women with early breast cancer who had received adjuvant endocrine therapies judged modest survival gains sufficient to make adjuvant endocrine therapy worthwhile.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Adjuvant treatment</field><field name="subject">Menopause -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Infertility, Female</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous diesel and natural gas injection for dual-fuelling compression-ignition engines</field><field name="creator">White, Timothy Ross, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The introduction of alternative fuels such as natural gas is likely to occur at an increasing rate. The dual-fuel concept allows these low cetane number fuels to be used in compression-ignition (CI, diesel) type engines. Most CI engine conversions have pre-mixed the alternative fuel with air in the intake manifold while retaining diesel injection into the cylinder for ignition. The advantage is that it is simple for practical adaptation; the disadvantage is that good substitution levels are only obtained at midload. A better solution is to inject both the alternative and diesel fuels directly into the cylinder. Here, the fuel in the end-zone is limited and the diesel, injected before the alternative, has only a conventional ignition delay. This improves the high-end performance. Modern, very high pressure diesel injectors have good turndown characteristics as well as better controllability. This improves low-end performance and hence offers an ideal platform for a dual-fuel system. Several systems already exist, mainly for large marine engines but also a few for smaller, truck-sized engines. For the latter, the key is to produce a combined injector to handle both fuels which has the smallest diameter possible so that installation is readily achieved. There exists the potential for much improvement. A combined gas/diesel injection system based on small, high pressure common-rail injectors has been tested for fluid characteristics. Spray properties have been examined experimentally in a test rig and modelled using CFD. The CFD package Fluent was used to model the direct-injection of natural gas and diesel oil simultaneously into an engine. These models were initially calibrated using high-speed photographic visualisation of the jets. Both shadowgraph and schlieren techniques were employed to identify the gas jet itself as well as mixing regions within the flow. Different orientations and staging of the jets with respect to each other were simulated. Salient features of the two fuel jets were studied to optimise the design of a dual-fuel injector for CI engines. Analysis of the fuel-air mixture strength during the injection allowed the ignition delay to be estimated and thus the best staging of the jets to be determined.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural gas</field><field name="subject">Diesel motor -- Alternate fuels</field><field name="subject">Combustion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dense gas particle processing for alternative drug delivery formulations</field><field name="creator">Tandya, Andrian, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pulmonary and oral drug administrations are usually the preferred methods of delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients.Generally,pulmonary drug formulations are more attractive compared to oral formulations since they consist of micron-sized powders with high surface area thus having faster onset of action,as well as minimizing the drug dosage and side effects.Oral insulin formulations,if achievable,would provide an alternative to injectable insulin,as the common drawbacks of injectable insulin are the multiple daily injections and the possibility of skin infections at the injection site. In this study,the feasibility of using dense gas particle processing techniques known as the Aerosol Solvent Extraction System (ASES),Gas Anti-Solvent (GAS)and High-Pressure Media Milling (HPMM)for pharmaceutical processing was assessed.The ASEStechnique,utilizing dense ethane,was employed to prepare insulin-lactose formulations for pulmonary administration whilst the GAS and ASES techniques,utilizing dense CO2,were employed to prepare microencapsulated formulations containing insulin and Eudragit?? S100 for oral administration.Furthermore,the HPMM technique,utilizing dense hydrofluocarbon (HFC)134a/227ea,was employed to prepare suspension Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI)formulations containing budesonide and various surfactants. The Fine Particle Fraction (FPF)of processed insulin without the presence of lactose was found to be 44%.In other words,44% of processed insulin delivered to the impactor stages (excluding the throat and neck)has aerodynamic diameter of less than 5??m.With the addition of lactose as carrier,the FPFof the insulin-lactose (1:1w/w)formulation increased to 64%.The increase in FPFwas attributed to the lower density of lactose particles compared to that of insulin particles to produce an intimate mixture with enhanced powder flowability and aerodynamic performance. Proteins for oral delivery should ideally be formulated with acid-resistant polymer as a protective coating to protect against enzymatic degradation in the stomach.Eudragit?? S100,which is insoluble or almost impermeable at pH 1-4and soluble at pH 5-7,was used to prepare oral insulin formulations.The insulin release at pH 3was sustained by the Eudragit?? S100coating and the encapsulation efficiency of insulin??Eudragit?? S100formulations varied between 6% and 24% depending on the initial drug to polymer ratio. One of the major therapies utilizing metered dose inhaler formulations in the treatment of asthma has been studied using the HPMM process.The HPMM process has been demonstrated to be an efficient milling process for the enhancement of the physical stability and aerodynamic performance of budesonide in HFC-134a/227ea propellant formulations.No significant change in physical stability was observed in the formulations for 2 weeks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical technology</field><field name="subject">Drug delivery ststems</field><field name="subject">Drugs -- Solubility -- Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of service support in multi-rate wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Pong, Dennis, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Packet switched wireless networks have become increasingly popular due to improvements in transmission speed, ease of deployment and mobility. Wireless technologies such as the IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks provide transmission speeds capable of supporting multimedia applications. However, wireless channels suffer from short term effects such as interference and fading, and long term effects such as signal strength changes that are caused by user mobility. In multi-rate networks, stations can adapt to the channel variations by adjusting their physical transmission rates. This introduces resource management problems as resource usage depends on the application's bit rate as well as the physical transmission rate used. Multimedia applications demand consistent Quality of Service (QoS) performance from the network. This does not fit well with the dynamic nature of wireless networks. In this thesis, we propose a link layer resource manager to maintain application QoS requirements in multi-rate wireless networks. It consists of two components - Resource reservation and Medium Access Control (MAC) parameters selection. The resource reservation algorithm determines the current and future amount of channel resources required by a multimedia application and performs the function of admission control. This prevents any new traffic or physical transmission rate changes from degrading the QoS of the admitted traffic. The design of the MAC parameters selection algorithm is based on the IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) scheme. The algorithm enables the provision of QoS to individual multimedia applications with the prioritised service of EDCA. Analytical and simulation studies were performed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithms. The results highlighted the ability of the algorithms to mitigate the QoS provision problem in multi-rate wireless networks introduced by channel variations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Computer networks - Quality control</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication - Traffic - Management</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reporting injury in older people: epidemiological profile and knowledge gains from data linkage</field><field name="creator">Boufous, Soufiane, Public Health &amp; Communtiy Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">As the populations ages rapidly, injury in older people is increasingly becoming a major health problem. This thesis examines the epidemiology of common injuries in older people and how data linkage can improve injury surveillance as well as knowledge about the circumstances and outcomes of injury in older people. These issues are explored using data from New South Wales, Australia and the emphasis is on injuries resulting from falls and traffic crashes as the most common mechanisms of injury in older people. The epidemiology and trends of hospitalisations as a result of hip, pelvic and wrist fractures are examined using NSW hospitalisation data during the 1990's. Internal data linkage of the 2000-2001 NSW hospitalisation data is used to eliminate double counting of hospital admissions for injurious falls in older people and to assess the validity and estimate the effects of previously used approaches on the incidence of hospitalised falls. Probabilistic data linkage of hospital and police crash records for the same year is also used to examine data quality in both collections and to explore the relationship between the circumstances and outcomes of injury in older drivers injured in a traffic crash. The findings of the epidemiological profile of hip, pelvic and wrist fractures in older people indicate that they are likely to continue to impose a considerable burden on acute health care services. The internal linkage of hospital data shows that data linkage techniques allow the identification of incident cases of hospitalised falls and point to the low validity of previously used approaches to estimate the incidence of these cases. Record linkage of hospital and police records demonstrates the limitations of using the datasets separately to examine the burden of traffic injuries in older people and shows the importance of environmental factors, complex road intersections in particular, in high injury severity in older drivers. The thesis also discusses some of the challenges of using record linkage for injury research and highlights the importance of including the date of injury and a unique personal identifier to improve the surveillance and reporting of injuries, including those in older people.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Injury</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">data linkage</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of selected in vitro assays for assessing the toxicity of chemicals and their mixtures</field><field name="creator">Azzi, Rola, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">From a regulatory point of view, the main objective of acute toxicity testing is to classify chemicals according to their intrinsic toxicity. This is conventionally conducted on the basis of the animal LD50 methods however, this test has been widely criticised. Moreover, conventional toxicity testing focuses on single chemicals and often human exposures are to more than one chemical. This research study had two main objectives. The first was to investigate the accuracy of selected in vitro tests for predicting the acute toxic action of chemicals in rodents and humans, and in predicting the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) categories. The second was to explore the relevance of in vitro tests in determining the nature of toxicological interactions (i.e. additive, antagonistic and synergistic) among binary and ternary chemical mixtures. A battery of cytotoxicity tests (MTS, NRU, LDH and ATP) assays were used to determine the toxicity of 21 chemicals spread across the GHS categories where mercuric chloride (GHS category 1) was the most toxic chemical and glycerol (GHS unclassified) the least toxic. Significant differences for the majority of test chemicals were found among all assays, highlighting the need for a battery of in vitro tests measuring different endpoints. The NRU assay was found to be a more sensitive measure of toxicity for most chemicals and predicted all of the GHS categories. In general, in vitro IC50 values correlated well with in vivo rodent (LD50); human acute toxicity (LDL0 and LC) data and published in vitro data. In addition, in vitro NOEC values correlated well with published TLV. Selected assays (MTS, NRU) were applied to binary (15) and ternary (5) chemical mixtures. Mixtures were prepared at mixture ratios proportional to the potency of individual components. Experimental data was used to assess the predictive capabilities of two approaches (mathematical model and concentration addition) commonly used by regulatory agencies which assume additive effect. However, all three interactions (antagonism, synergism and additivity) where observed in this study. These results suggest that these interactions cannot be excluded from toxicological risk assessments. The methods developed and information obtained from this study provide a comprehensive comparison between selected in vitro assays for assessing the toxicity of chemicals and their mixtures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating green building assessment tools: a risk-analysis based approach</field><field name="creator">Chandra, Shailja, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates risks arising from the mechanism of green building assessment tools that may impact on the consistency of their outcomes and render them ineffective in reliably fulfilling their goals in the building industry. None of the past efforts at developing assessment tools have focused on the risk aspects of assessment tools. Moreover, slowly the building industry has started placing considerable reliance on them without completely understanding the consequences of potential risks. The origin of risks lies in the realization that assessing sustainability in buildings is complex and full of conflicting concepts and opinions, and that amidst all this, assessment tools are expected to deliver multiple performance objectives and goals. Given that the importance of assessing sustainability in buildings cannot be ignored, it becomes extremely important that assessment tools are understood well and are free from risks. To accomplish this, an array of potential risks are systematically brought together using a risk categorization method, which facilitated a basis to critically analyse the literature in the light of risks. This addressed the acknowledged gap in the literature on risks relating to assessment tools. Four categories are discussed under this categorization. These categories provide a basis for the quantitative investigation, which applies techniques of uncertainty analysis to quantify these risks. In the quantitative investigation, uncertainty in 40 input parameters is propagated through several alternative forms of the mechanism of assessment tools. The input parameters are selected using the assessment data of a case study (Arts Faculty building, University of Sunshine Coast). The design of alternative forms of the mechanism is based on the identified risk categories and is carried out using a vehicle assessment tool (Green Building Tool). The uncertainty propagation is carried out using a risk analysis tool (@Risk). Descriptive statistics is deployed to analyse the results of the uncertainty propagations. Analysis of the results has brought an understanding and insights into various aspects of the mechanism in the context of their predisposition to increase or decrease risks. To ensure that an assessment tool's specific goals are fulfilled, the mechanism needs to be designed carefully so that it is low-risk and appropriate to the intent. By providing in-depth insights into the mechanism, the methodology and outcomes of this research are important for the future development of green building assessment tools.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buildings - Environmental engineering</field><field name="subject">Green products</field><field name="subject">Technology - Risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of cocaine use on outcomes for the treatment of heroin dependence in Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Anna, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the effect of cocaine use on treatment outcomes for heroin dependent individuals in Sydney, Australia. A naturalistic, longitudinal design was employed in order to examine the effects of cocaine on outcomes over a two year period. Study 1 assessed the prevalence and correlates of cocaine use among heroin dependent individuals. Cocaine use was found to be common among entrants to all three of the major treatment modalities in NSW. Heroin users who also used cocaine (CU) displayed a poorer clinical profile at baseline than non-cocaine users (NCU), reporting higher levels of drug use and dependence, and a greater prevalence of needle risk-taking and criminal behaviour. Study 2 examined outcomes three months post-study entry. CU and NCU were found to have been equally well retained in treatment. Despite significantly reduced levels of cocaine use amongst the cohort, however, CU continued to display the higher levels of drug-related harm that characterized them at baseline. In order to determine whether cocaine use itself was responsible for the greater levels of harm observed amongst CU, or whether instead CU were an inherently more dysfunctional group for whom cocaine use merely served as a marker, comparisons were made within groups on the basis of cocaine use patterns over the study period. The results of these analyses demonstrated that commencing cocaine use resulted in a clear decline in functioning, whereas cessation resulted in corresponding improvements.  In Study 3 outcomes were examined twelve months post-study. Baseline cocaine use was again found to predict poorer outcome, despite a large scale reduction in cocaine use amongst the cohort. Importantly, CU were significantly less likely than NCU to be abstinent from heroin at twelve months and more likely to have been incarcerated since study entry. In addition, the effect of persistence of cocaine use was examined. Results indicated that the harms associated with cocaine use increased with increasing persistence of use. Outcomes at two years post-study entry were explored in Study 4. At this time CU and NCU recorded similar outcomes in most domains. Thus, it appeared that the harms caused by cocaine use may take a substantial period of time to diminish. Patterns of cocaine use and motivations for cessation and commencement were also examined. Responses suggested that cocaine use amongst the cohort was largely opportunistic, with participants ceasing use for a variety of reasons, including the financial and psychological problems caused by cocaine use. Past year prevalence of cocaine dependence was measured in this study, with the majority of those who had used cocaine in the past year meeting criteria for dependence. In Study 5, generalized estimating equations were used to measure the effect of baseline cocaine use on major outcome variables over the entire two year study period. Even after controlling for treatment variables, heroin use and other baseline polydrug use, the results of this study confirmed previous findings within the thesis by demonstrating the negative effect of baseline cocaine use on most outcome variables. Evidently, cocaine use among dependent heroin users has serious, long lasting, consequences. To date, however, there has been a stark lack of research examining the effect of cocaine use on treatment outcomes for heroin dependence. To that end, the results of this thesis are encouraging, suggesting that treatment for heroin dependence may also aid in reducing cocaine use among this group.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cocaine habit -- New South Wales --  Sydney</field><field name="subject">Narcotic addicts -- New South Wales -- Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of software measurement</field><field name="creator">Berry, Michael, CSE, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background and purpose. This thesis documents a program of five studies concerned with the assessment of software measurement. The goal of this program is to assist the software industry to improve the information support for managers, analysts and software engineers by providing evidence of where opportunities for improving measurement and analysis exist. Methods. The first study examined the assessment of software measurement frameworks using models of best practice based on performance/success factors. The software measurement frameworks of thirteen organisations were surveyed. The association between a factor and the outcome experienced with the organisations' frameworks was then evaluated. The subsequent studies were more info-centric and investigated using models of information quality to assess the support provided for software processes. For these studies, information quality models targeting specific software processes were developed using practitioner focus groups. The models were instantiated in survey instruments and the responses were analysed to identify opportunities to improve the information support provided. The final study compared the use of two different information quality models for the assessing and improving information support. Assessments of the same quantum of information were made using a targeted model and a generic model. The assessments were then evaluated by an expert panel in order to identify which information quality model was more effective for improvement purposes. Results. The study of performance factors for software measurement frameworks confirmed the association of some factors with success and quantified that association. In particular, it demonstrated the importance of evaluating contextual factors. The conclusion is that factor-based models may be appropriately used for risk analysis and for identifying constraints on measurement performance. Note, however, that a follow-up study showed that some initially successful frameworks subsequently failed. This implied an instability in the dependent variable, success, that could reduce the value of factor-based models for predicting success. The studies of targeted information quality models demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted assessments for identifying improvement opportunities and suggest that they are likely to be more effective for improvement purposes than using generic information quality models. The studies also showed the effectiveness of importance-performance analysis for prioritizing improvement opportunities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">Software Measurement</field><field name="subject">Measurement and Analysis</field><field name="subject">Software Metric</field><field name="subject">Measurement Program</field><field name="subject">Metrics Program</field><field name="subject">Software Measurement Framework</field><field name="subject">Information Quality</field><field name="subject">Targeted Assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation of ??-eucryptite and ??-spodumene from topaz mixtures</field><field name="creator">Lu, Hong, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The production of ??-eucryptite [LiAlSiO4] and ??-spodumene [LiAlSi2O6] from topaz [Al2SiO4(F0.64OH0.36)2, containing ~3 wt% quartz impurity] from Torrington, NSW may be of commercial importance since both lithium aluminosilicates have negative or low coefficients of thermal expansion and are used commercially as raw materials in the glass, ceramics, and metallurgical industries.  A review of the literature has revealed that the production of ??-eucryptite and ??-spodumene from topaz has not been reported before.  The aim of the present work was to determine the kinetics and reaction mechanisms of formation of ??-eucryptite from topaz + lithium carbonate mixtures and ??-spodumene from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures.  To this end, the related reactions and subsolidus phase equilibria of the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 ternary system were determined.  The subsolidus phase equilibria for the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 ternary system were investigated by literature assessment, experimentation, and thermodynamic calculations.  The experimentation confirmed the previously published tentative compatibility relations in the Al2O3 and the SiO2 corners.  Thermodynamic calculations were used to define the phase relations in the Li2O corner.  Thermodynamic calculations also were used to define the phase equilibria for two binary subsystems, Li2SiO3-LiAlO2 and Li4SiO4-LiAlO2.  The decomposition of topaz and formation of ??-eucryptite from topaz + lithium carbonate mixtures and ??-spodumene from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures were investigated experimentally using differential thermal analysis (DTA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman microspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Confirmatory thermodynamic calculations also were done.  One significant finding of the present work was the formation of nanofibres from topaz + lithium carbonate mixtures at 1150???C.  These fibres were formed by gas-phase reaction of SiF4 and AlOF produced from the reaction between topaz, lithium carbonate and by reaction of SiO2 and Li(OH), which was produced by Li2O volatilisation.  These fibres, which were difficult to analyse, most likely consisted of metastable ???-spodumene solid solution or mullite in the incipient stage of formation.  Formation of single-phase ???-spodumene from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures was observed after heating above 950???C for 24 h.  Reaction paths for the formation of ??-spodumene over the temperature range 450???-1550???C were proposed.  The formation of single-phase ??-spodumene was not simple and straightforward but a complex process involving several precursor phases.  Specifically, there were two reaction mechanisms involving the formation of single-phase ???-spodumene by gas-solid reaction and gas-liquid-solid reaction.  The reaction kinetics and thermodynamics of the formation of single-phase ??-spodumene at 750???-950???C were assessed.  Essential work supplementary to that associated with the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system consisted of determination of the decomposition mechanism of topaz, which was determined to take place in four stages.  Reaction paths for the decomposition of topaz also were proposed.  Another significant finding of the present work was the formation of transient single-crystal mullite from topaz + lithium carbonate + silica mixtures at ~600???C, which may be contrasted with the normal temperature range of 1000???-1400???C for formation from clay-based raw materials.  This phenomenon occurred via a gas-solid growth mechanism.  The present observation suggests a potential low-temperature route for the production of high-purity mullite fibres without glass contamination.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucryptite</field><field name="subject">Spodumene</field><field name="subject">Lithium silicates</field><field name="subject">Topaz</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising power capture for service differentiation in wireless LANs</field><field name="creator">Nyandoro, Alfandika, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent years, wireless communication systems have become pervasive, allowing continuous connectivity for people on the move, at home and in the workplace. The advent of third generation (3G) systems with capabilities beyond traditional telephony, and the explosive uptake of wireless Local Area Networks (LANs) are but two factors that have contributed to this growth. By virtue of their appeal to the market, wireless LANs have proven to be a serious contender as the access technology of choice for traditional data as well as the emerging 3G networks. If wireless LANs are to be successful as an access technology, however, the issue of Quality of Service (QoS) support will need to be addressed. QoS support for wireless LANs is becoming increasingly important because applications requiring such support, e.g. voice and video, are becoming more common in today's hybrid wireless systems, with the trend expected to grow into the future. The dominant standard for wireless LANs is the IEEE's 802.11 of which the contention-based Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol; also known as the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF), is universally supported. While the DCF is widely supported, it provides no QoS support. In this work, we propose and study a new and different mechanism of achieving service differentiation in 802.11 wireless LANs. Our approach employs the capture effect as the vehicle for achieving QoS differentiation for the contention mode of the standard. This approach enriches current research efforts by providing another dimension to QoS provisioning in wireless LANs. Hitherto most proposals have focussed on the modification of some aspect of the protocol, such as the minimum contention window size (CWmin), the Distributed Inter-Frame Space (DIFS), or the maximum contention window size (CWmax), amongst others. Capture based service differentiation complements these efforts. It can be used alone or in conjunction with existing approaches to provide additional priority classes. In this thesis, the capture based service differentiation approach is proposed and studied through Markov chain modelling and simulation. From the study, the following conclusions were drawn. It was confirmed that capture based service differentiation is a feasible approach in wireless LANs and that it can be achieved with practical and sustainable power differences between the transmitters from different classes. A number of factors were found to influence the level of service differentiation, including the population ratios of hosts in the power classes, the power ratios of the transmitters as well as the capture threshold of the receiver. For practical considerations, a complete architectural framework is also proposed, including support functions such as Transmission Power Control (TPC), QoS Signalling and Admission Control.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless LANs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the heat transfer performance of compact heat exchangers by minimizing the contact resistance between fins and tubes</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Wui-wai, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thermal contact resistance or, its reciprocal, thermal contact conductance is an important parameter in a wide range of thermal phenomena. It plays a significant role in heat transfer applications such as electronic packaging and nuclear reactors. This parameter also appears in fin-tube heat exchangers; however, it is often neglected in the performance calculations of heat exchangers. This thesis project explores the means by which the heat transfer performance of a finned tube heat exchanger may be enhanced. It includes experimental studies and finite element analysis investigating the effects of expansion bullets and coatings on the thermal contact conductance. An apparatus has been designed and fabricated for the experimental part of the work. A finite element model established the fintube configuration to be used in the design and manufacture of the apparatus. The apparatus was specially made for measuring thermal contact conductance directly in a finned-tube heat exchanger both in vacuum and in gaseous environment. The experiments were done on hexagon shaped specimens with a single fin connecting seven tubes. Sixteen type-T thermocouples have been used to measure temperatures at several locations on the specimen. A full-scale quarter-fin model was chosen for a second finite element analysis. The model simulates the actual specimen and predicts the temperatures. The finite element analyses have been used to validate the experimental results. The experimental results from the bare contact specimens, assembled with different sizes of expansion bullet, show that while higher expansions enhance the thermal contact conductance, the effect of interstitial gas such as nitrogen is beneficial for all specimens expanded with the 9.42 mm size bullet. Applying a coating material with high thermal conductivity is also an effective way to enhance the thermal contact conductance. The results show that the highly conductive plating materials, such as zinc, tin, silver and gold, enhance the thermal contact conductance. The presence of interstitial gas such as nitrogen also results in higher heat transfer rates and higher thermal contact conductance compared to those obtained in vacuum.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers</field><field name="subject">Heat -- Transmission</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative position and saving behaviour</field><field name="creator">Tooth, Richard James, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">There appears to be a growing recognition among economists and other social commentators that people attempt to enhance their relative position (which is commonly described as status) through consumption choices and other behaviour. It has been less common to consider whether attempts to enhance relative position impact on saving behaviour. This thesis makes a number of contributions relating to the impact of relative position on saving behaviour. In this thesis I: - consider why concern for relative position may impact on saving behaviour. I demonstrate, with a simple intertemporal model the surprising result that when people are concerned with relative position, income risk can lead to most people saving less and the rich saving more. - conduct an empirical study to test the importance of relative position on saving behaviour. I find a statistically and economically significant relationship between peer income and saving behaviour consistent with theories that people actively forgo saving to seek to enhance their relative position. I use the data to demonstrate that relative position can help to explain why prior research has consistently found that the rich have higher saving rates. - consider the policy implications of relative position to saving behaviour. I examine the policies, primarily corrective taxation, that have been advocated to address externalities of relative position in a static setting. I find that there are significant issues when these policies are considered in an intertemporal setting. I examine the policy of mandatory saving in addressing distortions caused by relative position and the possibility that concern for relative position improves the effectiveness of mandatory saving policy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saving and investment</field><field name="subject">Finance, Personal</field><field name="subject">Consumption (Economics)</field><field name="subject">Economics - Sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blind source separation methods and their mechanical applications</field><field name="creator">Liu, Xianhua, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Blind Source Separation is a modern signal processing technique which recovers both the unknown sources and unknown mixing systems from only measured mixtures of signals. It has application in diverse fields such as communication, image processing, geological exploration and biomedical signal processing etc. This project studies the BSS problem, develop separation methods and reveal the potential for mechanical engineering applications. There are two models for blind source separation corresponding to the two ways that the sources are mixed, the instantaneous mixing model and the convolved mixing model. The author carried out a theoretical study of the first model by proposing an idea called Redundant Data Elimination which leads to geometric interpretation of the model, explains that circular distribution property is the reason why Gaussian signal mixtures can not be separated, and showed that this idea can improve separation accuracy for unsymmetrically distributed sources. This new idea enabled evaluation and comparison of two well-known algorithms and proposal of a simplified algorithm based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization of fourth order cumulant matrices, which is further developed by determining an optimized parameter value for separation convergence. Also based on the understanding from the RDE, an outlier spherical projection method is proposed to improve separation accuracy against outlier errors. Mechanical vibration or acoustic problems belong to the second model. After some theoretical study of the problem and the model, a novel application of the Blind Least Mean Square algorithm using Gray's variable norm as cost function is applied to engine vibration data to separate piston slap, fuel injection noise and cylinder pressure effects. Further, the algorithm is combined with a deflation algorithm for successive subtraction of recovered source responses from the measured mixture to enable the recovery of more sources. The algorithms are verified to be successful by simulation, and the separated engine sources are proved reasonable by analysing the engine operation and physical properties of the sources. The author also studied the relationship between these two models, the problems of different approaches for solving the model such as the frequency domain approach and the Bussgang approach, and sets out future research interests.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns in returns reported by hedge funds: strategic use of variance and avoidance of reporting small losses</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Timothy Ka Hei, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines systematic patterns in returns reported by hedge funds for the period from 1989 to 2003. Two patterns are examined: strategic changes in returns variance in the second half of the year and the avoidance of reporting small losses. The hedge fund industry has grown rapidly during the 1990s. Despite this rapid growth, and the large amount of investment in hedge funds, hedge funds are less regulated than other forms of investment. Given the lower level of regulation and the assumed ability of hedge fund managers to influence both investment policy and the estimation of value for illiquid assets included in the calculation of returns, I predict systematic patterns in hedge fund returns. Brown, Goetzmann and Park (2001) show that funds that perform poorly compared to their peers tend to adopt more risk in subsequent periods while funds that perform relatively well tend to adopt less risk. I replicate this result in a larger and more recent database of hedge fund returns. The strategic use of variance is more visible in the latter half of the fifteen year period examined. This result is consistent with increased investor scrutiny and competition between hedge funds in recent years. Burgstahler and Dichev (1997) show that public companies tend to avoid reporting small losses. I show that the well documented discontinuity around zero seen in public company earnings distributions is also found in the distribution of hedge fund returns. This is consistent with hedge fund managers facing similar pressure to public company managers to avoid reporting small losses, and managers having the ability to influence reported returns in a less regulated environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hedge funds</field><field name="subject">Hedging (Finance) -- Accounting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Y1 receptor for NPY: a novel regulator of immune cell function</field><field name="creator">Wheway, Julie Elizabeth, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychological conditions, including stress, compromise immune defenses. Although this concept is not novel, the molecular mechanism behind it remains unclear. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), regulates anxiety and is a part of the stress response. The NPY system also modulates immune functions such as cytokine release, cell migration, and innate immune cell activity. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves innervating lymphoid organs release NPY, which together with other peptides activate five receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6). Additionally, immune cells themselves release NPY following activation. Previous studies have shown that Y1 mediates NPY-immune effects and data presented here shows expression of Y1 on a wide range of immune cells. Results presented in this thesis, using Y1-deficient mice (Y1-/-), have uncovered a novel role for Y1 on immune cells. NPY acts endogenously to inhibit T cell activation whereas Y1-/- T cells are hyper-responsive to activation and trigger severe colitis after transfer into lymphopenic mice. Thus, signalling through the Y1 receptor on T cells inhibits T cell activation and controls the magnitude of T cell responses. Paradoxically, in Y1-/- mice, T cell differentiation to Th1 T cells appears to be defective as these mice were resistant to T helper type 1 (Th1) cell???mediated inflammatory responses and showed reduced levels of the Th1 cell???promoting cytokine interleukin 12 and reduced interferon ?? production. This defect was due to functionally impaired antigen presenting cells (APCs). Y1-deficient APCs are defective in their ability to produce Th1-promoting cytokines and present antigens to T cells and consequently, Y1-/- mice had reduced numbers of effector T cells. Key reciprocal bone marrow chimera experiments indicated that this effect is intrinsic to immune cells and not driven by other Y1-expressing cell types. These results demonstrate a fundamental bimodal role for the Y1 receptor in the immune system, serving as a strong negative regulator on T cells as well as a key activator of APC function. The findings presented in this thesis uncover a sophisticated molecular mechanism regulating immune cell functions and thus adds to a growing number of signalling pathways shared by the immune and nervous system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuropeptides</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic controllability analysis for linear multivariable processes based on passivity conditions</field><field name="creator">Suryodipuro, Andika Diwaji, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The operation of a chemical process plant has become more complex with the addition of process integration and intensification. A greater emphasis on producing goods with the lowest product variability in the safest manner possible and stringent environmental regulation limiting the quantity of effluent release have all put more constraints on the physical and economic performance of the chemical plant. The performance of a plant is quantified by the ability of the process system to achieve its objectives, which is governed by its process design and control. The conventional approach to process design and control selection starts sequentially by proposing a process flowsheet for the plant. The selection criteria for a flowsheet are normally based only on its environmental impact and economic merits. It is after a process flowsheet is deemed financially suitable that process control development commences. However, a more integrated approach to process design and control stage may thus lead to a plant that has better achievable performance. The aim of this project is to provide a new approach to quantitative dynamic controllability analysis for integration of process design and control by using the concept of passivity and passive systems. Passivity is an input/output property of processes. Passive processes are stable and minimum phase and therefore very easy to control. For a given process, its shortage of passivity, which reflects destabilizing effects of factors such as time delays and Right-Half Plane (RHP) zeros, can be used to indicate its controllability. The project focuses in developing the proposed controllability analysis by combining the idea of passivity and IMC invertibility, which is then formulated into an optimization problem that can be solved by either using Semi-Definite Programming or Non-Linear Optimization. The achievable performance of the plant is quantified in terms of the sensitivity function of the open-loop process. The selection of a process from four different heat-integrated distillation column schemes was used as a case study and the result had clearly shown that the passivity-based controllability analysis was able to select a process based on the plant achievable performance under the constraint of passivity and design parameters.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Passivity (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Passivity-based control</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">Chemical process control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of activation and implementation of the medical emergency team system</field><field name="creator">Cretikos, Michelle, School of Anaesthetics, Intensive Care &amp; Emergency Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem investigated: The activation and implementation of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) system. Procedures followed: The ability of the objective activation criteria to accurately identify patients at risk of three serious adverse events (cardiac arrest, unexpected death and unplanned intensive care admission) was assessed using a nested, matched case-control study. Sensitivity, specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were performed. The MET implementation process was studied using two convenience sample surveys of the nursing staff from the general wards of twelve intervention hospitals. These surveys measured the awareness and understanding of the MET system, level of attendance at MET education sessions, knowledge of the activation criteria, level of intention to call the MET and overall attitude to the MET system, and the hospital level of support for change, hospital capability and hospital culture. The association of these measures with the intention to call the MET and the level of MET utilisation was assessed using nonparametric  correlation.  Results obtained: The respiratory rate was missing in 20% of subjects. Using listwise deletion, the set of objective activation criteria investigated predicted an adverse event within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 55.4% (50.6-60.0%) and specificity of 93.7% (91.2-95.6%). An analysis approach that assumed the missing values would not have resulted in MET activation provided a sensitivity of 50.4% (45.7- 55.2%) and specificity of 93.3% (90.8-95.3%). Alternative models with modified cut-off values provided different results. The MET system was implemented with variable success during the MERIT study. Knowledge and understanding of the system, hospital readiness, and a positive attitude were all significantly positively associated with MET system utilisation, while defensive hospital cultures were negatively associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Major conclusions: The objective activation criteria studied have acceptable accuracy, but modification of the criteria may be considered. A satisfactory trade-off between the identification of patients at risk and workload requirements may be difficult to achieve. Measures of effectiveness of the implementation process may be associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Trials of the MET system should ensure good knowledge and understanding of the system, particularly amongst nursing staff.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At a crossroad: the GATS telecom framework and neo-patrimonial states: the politics of telecom reform in Kenya</field><field name="creator">Kerretts-Makau, Monica J J, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The liberalisation of domestic telecommunication (telecom) markets has become a worldwide trend. As a result, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), evolving from deliberations within the World Trade Organisation (WTO), has been heralded as the mechanism with which to effect telecom liberalisation domestically. For countries in Africa, the GATS instruments have been translated as a means to establish the principles required for an effective telecom industry supported by key institutions in policy, regulation and implementation. However, the analysis of relevant literature on telecom in Africa has tended to focus on technological developments based on current observable outcomes. This methodology is inadequate because it fails to account for the context-specific nature of the policy arena and framework shaping telecom outcomes. I argue that we must consider telecom outcomes by understanding the nature of political institutions domestically and their interaction with the international arena. To explicate this intersection of ideas, I draw on two seemingly independent theories, Neopatrimonialism and New Institutional Economics (NIE) with reference to the works of van de Walle (2001) and North (1990) respectively, to shed light on the nature of the Kenyan political context and the value of the GATS as an instrument that facilitates credibility and reduces opportunistic ex-post behaviour. It is contended in this study, that for the Kenyan Government, the value of the GATS accession lies in the legitimising role that it facilitates in accessing funds from the international community. This study thus highlights the inevitable tension that arises when domestic policy-reform goals are juxtaposed with international trade obligations undertaken through treaty accession and informed by a liberalisation agenda. A qualitative approach was used to collect the data and involved interviews and documentary analysis. The findings suggest that Kenya is partially in compliance with its GATS telecom commitments. However, this partial reform results from patrimonial  tendencies in Kenya and is exacerbated by the need to attract hard currency through aid packages that dictate the nature of the policy process and the relationship between Kenya and the international community. In conclusion, even with policy reforms, state agents always find ways to maintain or create clientelist practises. Unless such reform is accompanied by political changes that provide checks and balances on institutions and state agents, reform policies on their own will not create an effective telecom sector. To truly evaluate telecom reform therefore, we must appreciate the context-specific nature of policy making.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Trade Organization</field><field name="subject">General Agreement on Trade in Services</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication policy - Kenya</field><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-angular hyperspectral data and its influences on soil and plant property measurements: spectral mapping and functional data analysis approach</field><field name="creator">Sugianto, ., Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the spectral reflectance characteristics of soil and vegetation using multi-angular and single view hyperspectral data. The question of the thesis is ???How much information can be obtained from multi-angular hyperspectral remote sensing in comparison with single view angle hyperspectral remote sensing of soil and vegetation???? This question is addressed by analysing multi-angular and single view angle hyperspectral remote sensing using data from the field, airborne and space borne hyperspectral sensors. Spectral mapping, spectral indices and Functional Data Analysis (FDA) are used to analyse the data. Spectral mapping has been successfully used to distinguish features of soil and cotton with hyperspectral data. Traditionally, spectral mapping is based on collecting endmembers of pure pixels and using these as training areas for supervised classification. There are, however, limitations in the use of these algorithms when applied to multi-angular images, as the reflectance of a single ground unit will differ at each angle. Classifications using six-class endmembers identified using single angle imagery were assessed using multi-angular Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS) imagery, as well as a set of vegetation indices.  The results showed no significant difference between the angles. Low nutrient content in the soil produced lower vegetation index values, and more nutrients increased the index values. This research introduces FDA as an image processing tool for multi-angular hyperspectral imagery of soil and cotton, using basis functions for functional principal component analysis (fPCA) and functional linear modelling. FDA has advantages over conventional statistical analysis because it does not assume the errors in the data are independent and uncorrelated. Investigations showed that B-splines with 20-basis functions was the best fit for multi-angular soil spectra collected using the spectroradiometer and the satellite mounted CHRIS. Cotton spectra collected from greenhouse plants using a spectrodiometer needed 30-basis functions to fit the model, while 20-basis functions were sufficient for cotton spectra extracted from CHRIS. Functional principal component analysis (fPCA) of multi-angular soil spectra show the first fPCA explained a minimum of 92.5% of the variance of field soil spectra for different azimuth and zenith angles and 93.2% from CHRIS for the same target. For cotton, more than 93.6% of greenhouse trial and 70.6% from the CHRIS data were explained by the first fPCA. Conventional analysis of multi-angular hyperspectral data showed significant differences exist between soil spectra acquired at different azimuth and zenith angles. Forward scan direction of zenith angle provides higher spectral reflectance than backward direction. However, most multi-angular hyperspectral data analysed as functional data show no significant difference from nadir, except for small parts of the wavelength of cotton spectra using CHRIS. There is also no significant difference for soil spectra analysed as functional data collected from the field, although there was some difference for soil spectra extracted from CHRIS. Overall, the results indicate that multi-angular hyperspectral data provides only a very small amount of additional information when used for conventional analyses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-angular</field><field name="subject">CHRIS hyperspectral</field><field name="subject">functional data analysis</field><field name="subject">spectral mapping</field><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autolysis in the development and dispersal of biofilms formed by the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata</field><field name="creator">Mai-Prochnow, Anne Gerda Erna, Biotechnology &amp; Bio-molecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata produces target-specific inhibitory compounds against bacteria, algae, fungi and invertebrate larvae and is frequently found in association with living surfaces in the marine environment.

EDD, the human orthologue of Drosophila melanogaster ???hyperplastic discs???, is over-expressed or mutated in a number of common human cancers. EDD is a progestin regulated gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in cell communication and cell adhesion, and although it has also been implicated in the DNA damage response through its association with DNA damage proteins, a definitive role has yet to be demonstrated. The work presented herein shows that EDD is necessary for an adequate cellular response to double-strand DNA breaks. Cells depleted of EDD exhibit reduced survival, radio-resistant DNA synthesis and failure to maintain G2/M arrest following DNA damage induced by phleomycin exposure. Furthermore, EDD-depleted cells display impaired activating phosphorylation and kinase activity of the checkpoint kinase CHK2 after DNA damage. These effects appear to be largely modulated through a phospho-dependent interaction involving the CHK2 FHA domain and a region of EDD spanning a number of putative FHA-binding threonines. These results identify EDD as a novel mediator in DNA damage signal transduction via CHK2 and emphasise the potential importance of EDD in cancer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">DNA damage checkpoint</field><field name="subject">CHK2</field><field name="subject">EDD</field><field name="subject">Ubiquitin ligase</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">DNA repair</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High frequency errors in KFL and pedagogical strategies</field><field name="creator">Shin, Seong-Chul, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problematic areas of the teaching of Korean as a foreign language have been largely neglected in the past. Few studies combine the following three aspects: 1) an examination of learner Korean; 2) the provision of substantial linguistic and pedagogical explanations; and 3) the devising of teaching or learning strategies based on empirical evidence. By studying KFL learners and their language production, insights can be gained relating to the learning of KFL and instructors will be able to provide appropriate corrective measures. This study investigated errors produced by KFL learners, focusing primarily on high frequency orthographic, lexical and grammatical errors in written language production. The study attempts to identify key areas of difficulty in learning Korean, to investigate the possible cause of difficulties and to provide more adequate information for the teaching and learning of KFL. To this end the study uses two classes of textual data and employs both statistical and descriptive analyses. At an orthographic level the study has identified four main error categories: 1) mismatch in three series consonants, 2) mismatch in vowel sounds, 3) misuse of nasals and laterals, and 4) omission and addition of ???h???. Overall the cause of key error types correlates strongly with the differences in sound quality and sound patterns between Korean and English, with some intralingual features. At a lexical level, the study found nine types of errors including 1) semantic similarity, 2) lexical misselection and 3) overgeneralization. The findings suggest that learners have a great deal of difficulty in differentiating lexical items with similar meaning and in selecting words appropriate to particular contexts or situations. As for grammatical errors, the study identified the five most active error categories, which made up more than 80% of the total grammatical errors. An overwhelming majority of grammatical errors and case particle errors in particular were errors of substitution. Many high frequency grammatical errors had distinctive triggering factors such as particular types of verb and sentence construction. The findings of the study have several pedagogical implications. First, there are key common errors for English L1-KFL learners and these common errors need increased linguistic and pedagogical attention. Secondly, the results reinforce the need to pay more active attention to the usage of the main case particles, along with the triggering constructions causing substitutions. Thirdly, the findings suggest that different types of analysis should be done in order to facilitate a plausible description of the problematic KFL items. The study argues that despite being problematic, the items discussed in this thesis are learnable and worthy of being taught with explicit or intentional strategies and that there is a need for pedagogically effective and adequate instructional input to maximize the potential of the learner???s language development in Korean.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Korean language - Study and teaching - Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">Korean language - Errors of usage</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26162</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time power system disturbance identification and its mitigation using an enhanced least squares algorithm</field><field name="creator">Manmek, Thip, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes, analyses and implements a fast and accurate real-time power system disturbances identification method based on an enhanced linear least squares algorithm for mitigation and monitoring of various power quality problems such as current harmonics, grid unbalances and voltage dips. The enhanced algorithm imposes less real-time computational burden on processing the system and is thus called ???efficient least squares algorithm???. The proposed efficient least squares algorithm does not require matrix inversion operation and contains only real numbers. The number of required real-time matrix multiplications is also reduced in the proposed method by pre-performing some of the matrix multiplications to form a constant matrix. The proposed efficient least squares algorithm extracts instantaneous sine and cosine terms of the fundamental and harmonic components by simply multiplying a set of sampled input data by the pre-calculated constant matrix. A power signal processing system based on the proposed efficient least squares algorithm is presented in this thesis. This power signal processing system derives various power system quantities that are used for real-time monitoring and disturbance mitigation. These power system quantities include constituent components, symmetrical components and various power measurements. The properties of the proposed power signal processing system was studied using modelling and practical implementation in a digital signal processor. These studies demonstrated that the proposed method is capable of extracting time varying power system quantities quickly and accurately. The dynamic response time of the proposed method was less than half that of a fundamental cycle. Moreover, the proposed method showed less sensitivity to noise pollution and small variations in fundamental frequency. The performance of the proposed power signal processing system was compared to that of the popular DFT/FFT methods using computer simulations. The simulation results confirmed the superior performance of the proposed method under both transient and steady-state conditions. In order to investigate the practicability of the method, the proposed power signal processing system was applied to two real-life disturbance mitigation applications namely, an active power filter (APF) and a distribution synchronous static compensator (D-STATCOM). The validity and performance of the proposed signal processing system in both disturbance mitigations applications were investigated by simulation and experimental studies.  The extensive modelling and experimental studies confirmed that the proposed signal processing system can be used for practical real-time applications which require fast disturbance identification such as mitigation control and power quality monitoring of power systems</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Power system disturbance identification</field><field name="subject">Least squares algorithm</field><field name="subject">Electric power system stability</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Quality control</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Protection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of injury risks associated with wearing the enhanced combat helmet and night vision goggle - driver: frontal vehicle collision study</field><field name="creator">Nakaza, Edward Takeshi, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The requirement to operate vehicles in low light and/or night environments whilst wearing night vision goggle (NVG) systems has become increasingly common during military operations.  There is very limited research investigating injury risks associated with these systems during ground vehicle collisions. This study examined the injury risks associated with wearing the Australian Defence Force - Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) and NVG system, in frontal vehicle collisions.  This project consisted of two components: (1) crash tests using a sled and (2) numerical simulations of impacts.  Four dynamic sled tests were conducted using a 50th percentile, male, Hybrid III dummy positioned on a rigid seat. Frontal impact tests were performed at a 40 km/h change in velocity (*v) and 20 g deceleration. The test configurations were as follows: (a) Base; (no helmet or additional equipment); (b) ECH; and, (c) ECH and NVG. Condition (c) was carried out twice, to determine repeatability. The sled test protocols were reconstructed precisely with the numerical simulation package MADYMO and the simulations were shown to correlate well with the experimental results. Using this validated model, four parametric studies were undertaken to assess the influence of counterweights, seat cushion, seatbelt pre-tensioner, and the vehicle's *v and acceleration on injury risks.  The study found that neck loads were within acceptable limits, with the exception of the neck extension moment, which was exceeded for all NVG conditions. Based on the parametric studies, no major improvements were observed in the neck extension moments with the use of counterweights or a seat cushion. In contrast the use of a seatbelt pre-tensioner was observed to decrease greatly this neck injury risk in certain scenarios. The study also identified that a *v of 15 km/h and peak acceleration of up to 14 g were required to keep the neck extension moment below the prescribed injury criteria. However, the high neck extension moment values may have been partially attributable to the stiff Hybrid III neck.  This study identified a possible injury mechanism for soldiers using the ECH and NVG system during specific impact scenarios.

Stanislavski, Meyerhold, Piscator, Brecht, Grotowski, and more recently Peter Brook are only a few of the figures who tried to engage spectators and enable them to participate more fully in the play. Yet in Iran there has existed for over three centuries a form of theatre which, thanks to its unique method of approaching reality, creates precise moments in which the worlds of the actor and the spectator come together in perfect unity. It is called ???taziyeh???, and the aim of this thesis is to offer a comprehensive account of this complex and sophisticated theatre. The thesis examines taziyeh through the accounts of eyewitnesses, and explores taziyeh???s method of acting, its form, concepts, the aims of each performance, its sources and origins, and the evolution of this Iranian phenomenon from its emergence in the tenth century. Developed from the philosophical point of view of Iranian mysticism on the one hand, and annual mourning ceremonies with ancient roots on the other, taziyeh has been performed by hundreds of different professional groups for more than three hundred years. Each performance is a significant event in the experience of actors and spectators. The thesis argues that through a careful and comprehensive exploration of taziyeh from its emergence to our time, we can ultimately experience a new horizon in theatre in which we may discover theatrical potentiality and dynamism in a way that has not yet been achieved in conventional Western theatre.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ta'ziyah -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Theater -- Iran</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of initial microstructure on the deformation and annealing behaviour of low carbon steel.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Wanqiang, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effect of initial microstructures of an 0.05 wt.% C low carbon steel, acicular ferrite (AF), Bainite (B), polygonal ferrite (PF), fine polygonal ferrite (FPF), and a microstructure produced by direct strip casting (DSC) (termed SC),  on the deformation and recrystallization behaviour of cold rolled low carbon (LC) steel, was investigated.  The initially prepared samples with the initial microstructures were cold rolled to 50, 70 and 90% reductions, then annealed isothermally in the temperature range 580 ??? 680 oC.  The microstructures and textures produced by deformation and annealing were studied by optical microscopy, XRD, TEM, SEM and EBSD. The initial microstructures were characterized mainly by optical microscopy and EBSD.  Using EBSD, the ferrite grain size of the AF, B and SC samples was considerably larger than that found by optical microscopy with a large fraction of low angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) observed within prior austenite grains.  All samples exhibited a very weak texture close to random.  After cold rolling, the microstructures of AF and SC contained shear bands with PF and FPF generating deformation bands.  For AF and SC, the pearlite phase was more extensively elongated in rolling direction compared with PF and FPF.  After 90% cold rolling reduction, PF, FPF and SC consist mainly of the   texture component and AF and B  .  It was found that FPF recrystallized most rapidly followed by B, PF and AF with SC recrystallizing orders of magnitude more slowly due to the solution drag caused by its uniformly distributed higher Mn content.  Very strong   (???-fibre) texture was generated in cold rolled PF followed by FPF, with AF, SC and B generating very weak textures.  The texture evolution during annealing 90% reduction PF was examined in further detail.

Maser sites often occur in proximity to UCHII regions, however, up to 75 per cent of sites have no detectable radio counterpart (Walsh 1998) and are instead hypothesised to trace the less evolved 'hot molecular core' phase of stellar evolution. This has been confirmed for a only handful of well known sources (e.g., Cesaroni 1994). Presented here are the results of multi-species molecular line observations towards warm, dusty clumps, undertaken with the goal of investigating the relationship between hot cores, UCHII regions and CH3OH masers.  Data from the 22-m Mopra telescope is used extensively in this thesis and substantial efforts were made to calibrate the brightness temperature scale. Measurements conducted on SiO masers and planets show that the beam pattern is divided into a Gaussian main beam plus an inner error lobe, which in 2004 contained 1/3 of the power in the main beam. Full-width half-maximum beam sizes were measured from the data and the beam efficiencies were derived for the years 2000-2004. A 3-mm wavelength molecular line survey was conducted, using Mopra, towards 83 massive star-forming clumps associated with CH3OH masers. Emission from the transitions 13CO (1-0), N2H+ (1-0), HCO+ (1-0), HCN (1-0) and HNC (1-0) was detected towards 82 sources (99 per cent), while CH3OH emission was detected towards 78 sources (94 per cent). The warm gas tracer CH3CN was observed specifically to search for hot core chemistry, and was detected towards 58 sources (70 per cent), confirming that CH3OH masers are excellent tracers of hot cores. CH3CN is found to be brighter and more commonly detected towards masers associated with UCHII regions compared to 'isolated' masers. That CH3CN is detected towards isolated maser sources strongly suggests that these objects are internally heated.  The molecular line data have been used to derive rotational temperatures and chemical abundances in the clumps and these properties have been compared between sub-samples associated with different indicators of evolution. In particular, CH3OH is found to be brighter and more abundant in UCHII regions and in sources with detected CH3CN, and may constitute a crude molecular clock in single dish observations.  Gas-kinematics were analysed via asymmetries in the HCO+ line profiles. Approximately equal numbers of red and blue-skewed profiles, indicative of inward or outward motions, respectively, are found among all classes of object.  Bolometric luminosities were derived via greybody fits to the sub-millimetre and mid-infrared spectral energy distributions, and an empirical gas-mass to luminosity relation of L proportional to M^0.68 was fit to the sample. This is a considerably shallower power law than L proportional to M^3 for massive main-sequence stars.  In the mid-infrared, 12 sources were identified as 'infrared dark clouds' (IRDCs). Such objects have been hypothesised as precursors to the hot core phase of evolution, however, we find these sources have greater linewidths and rotational temperatures than the bulk of the sample, and one contains an embedded HII region  The filamentary star forming region NGC3576 was also investigated via a molecular line and 23 GHz continuum mapping survey, utilising the ATCA, Mopra and Tidbinbilla telescopes. The results of these observations provide detailed information on the morphology, masses, kinematics, and physical and chemical conditions along the cloud. Analysis of NH3 data has revealed that the temperature and linewidth gradients exist in the western arm of the filament. Values are highest near to the central HII region, indicating that the embedded cluster of young stars is influencing the conditions in the bulk of the gas.  Six new H2O masers were detected in the arms of the filament, all associated with clumps of NH3 emission. Star formation is clearly underway, however, clump masses range from 1 to 128 solar masses, possibly too low to harbour very massive stars. The lack of detected 23 GHz continuum emission in the arms supports this assertion.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ISM:molecules</field><field name="subject">stars:formation</field><field name="subject">HII regions</field><field name="subject">radio lines:ISM</field><field name="subject">ISM:abundances</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">stars:pre-main-sequence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Media Politics : how is the media agenda of Chinese television set by the state, market, and civil society?</field><field name="creator">Li, Nan, School of Social Science &amp; International Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">How is the media agenda of Chinese television set by the three institutional powers, the state, market and civil society? How do formal and informal institutions of the state, market and civil society in contemporary China set the media agenda with specific rules and organizations? And what are the power relations among the three institutions that shape the structure and functionaries of mass media in general? Based on a new theoretical framework of media agenda-setting for the analysis of media politics in contemporary China, these questions are explored in three sections.  First, policies and regulations had been established by formal and informal institutions of the state to safeguard the state agenda as the primary media agenda. The second, market set audience rating and commercial income as major rules for Chinese television to survive in a competitive economy. The third, emerging civil society set moral standards for television broadcasters to produce programs to check the failure of the state and market on one hand, and to serve the needs and rights of audience as-citizens on the other. The constant changing power relations between the state and market, or between the state and civil society are also explored in sections that market and civil society interact respectively with the state to set the media agenda. The first finding of this thesis relates to the nature of contemporary Chinese television. As one servant for three masters, Chinese television is a mixed entity, which can be motivated to be a state agent, a market entity, and sometimes, a civil society player as well. In long term, Chinese television can be expected to be differentiated and reorganized as affiliates to the three institutions respectively along with the gradual establishment of a checks-and-balances system within and between the state, market, and civil society. The second finding concerns power relations among the three institutions. While both market and civil society emerged to be more and more dynamic in motivating the media to accommodate new social agendas, the state remains as the primary power in setting the media agenda of Chinese television.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Politics and culture -- China.</field><field name="subject">Meida and public affairs -- China.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defect chemistry and charge transport in niobium-doped titanium dioxide</field><field name="creator">Sheppard, Leigh Russell, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present project has made a comprehensive assessment of the effect of Nb doping on various charge-transfer related properties of TiO2. Of particular focus, the electrical properties of Nb-doped TiO2 (0.65 at %) have been investigated using the simultaneous measurement of electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power. This investigation was undertaken at elevated temperatures (1073 K -- 1298 K) in equilibrium with a gas phase of controlled oxygen activity (10-10 Pa &lt; p(O2) &lt; 75 kPa). In addition, the effect of segregation on the surface versus bulk composition of Nb-doped TiO2 was also investigated at a function of temperature and oxygen activity. Specifically, the following determinations were undertaken:   The effect of oxygen activity, p(O2) and temperature on both electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power   The effect of Nb on the defect disorder and related electrical properties of TiO2   The determination of equilibration kinetics and the associated chemical diffusion data for Nb-doped TiO2  The determination of Nb bulk diffusion in TiO2  The effect of p(O2), temperature and dopant content on Nb segregation and the related surface composition of Nb-doped TiO2  The obtained electrical properties enable the determination of a defect disorder model for Nb-doped TiO2, which may be considered within the following p(O2) regimes:  Strongly Reduced Regime. In this regime, the predominant ionic defect was anticipated to be oxygen vacancies compensated electronically by electrons. While the transition to this regime (from higher p(O2)) was clearly observed, the predominant defect disorder existing beyond this transition was not confirmed due to an inability to obtain sufficiently low oxygen activity. Metallic-type conductivity behaviour was observed within this transition region.  Reduced Regime I. In this regime, the predominate defect disorder defined by the electronic compensation of incorporated Nb ions by electrons was clearly observed.        Reduced Regime II. In this regime, the predominate defect disorder defined by the ionic compensation of incorporated Nb ions by quadruply-charged titanium vacancies, was clearly observed.  The present project included the determination of diffusion data which included: Temperature dependence of 93Nb tracer diffusion in single crystal TiO2 over the temperature range 1073 K -- 1573 K  Chemical diffusion coefficient over the temperature range 1073 K -- 1298 K and oxygen activity range, 10-10 Pa &lt; p(O2) &lt; 75 kPa These pioneering studies are significant as they enable the prediction of the processing conditions required to reliably 1) incorporate Nb into the TiO2 lattice, and 2) achieve equilibrium with the gas phase.  Finally, the present project included investigations on the effect of Nb segregation on the surface composition of Nb-doped TiO2, with the following outcomes:  Due to segregation, the surface can be significantly enriched in Nb compared to the bulk The extent of enrichment increases as the bulk Nb content or the oxygen activity is decreased  Following enrichment, the surface Nb concentration could be sufficiently high to assume a unique surface phase  The outcomes of the present project are significant as they can enable the processing of TiO2 with enhanced charge transport and controlled surface properties.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar energy.</field><field name="subject">Renewable energy sources.</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide.</field><field name="subject">Niobium.</field><field name="subject">Crystals -- Defects.</field><field name="subject">Semiconductors -- Impurity distribution.</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor doping.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and verification of catalytic membrane reactor for H2 recovery from H2S</field><field name="creator">Chan, Pui Yik Peggy, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hydrogen sulfide is toxic by-product of many petroleum, petrochemical and mineral treatment operations. Due to the increasing stringent environment regulations, toxic H2S must be completely removed from industrial waste gases before venting to the atmosphere. The H2S decomposition reaction is a well known thermodynamically limited reaction. Alumina membrane fixed bed catalytic reactors offer the potential for improved conversions at reduced operating temperature due to product separation and catalyst activity. A theoretical and experimental work dealing with a packed bed membrane reactor is the subject of this thesis.  A tubular alumina membrane reactor possessing thermal and corrosion resistance has been developed. A multicomponent permeation study indicated that the fluxes of gases could be quantitatively described as a combination of Knudsen diffusion and viscous flow through the porous alumina membrane. The catalytic decomposition of hydrogen sulfide to hydrogen and sulfur was conducted in membrane reactor incorporating a commercial porous alumina membrane in combination with catalytic function of bimetallic RuMo sulfide catalyst. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility of achieving conversion above the equilibrium conversion. The reaction rate is equal to the intrinsic rate since both internal/external mass transfer and heat transfer resistance are negligible for the size of catalyst particles considered. Results obtained with this system have shown a maximum of 2.3 times the equilibrium conversion at the operating temperature 983K, which was equivalent to the conversion at operating temperature 1200K in a conventional fixed bed reactor. The conversion enhancement was significant for the operation with high sweep to feed molar ratio. The reactor configuration of membrane reactor appeared to have an influence on its performance. Comparative experimental and simulation study showed that the cocurrent mode gave slightly higher conversion over counter-current mode.  Mathematical models were developed for the reactor, based on plug flow behavior. Simulation had been performed in order to validate the model against experimental data. Reactor optimization was carried out using the validated model. The simulation results from the non-isothermal model were in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, the isothermal model which neglected heat effects that took place in the reactor, has leaded to over-predicted conversion. This study also illustrated that predictive simulations could be used to explore the effects of recycle operation; the optimization study showed that the alumina membrane reactor permitting retentate recycle, could achieve up to 48.6% conversion, corresponding to 6 folded of the equilibrium conversion. The simulations provide a logical methodology for experimental planning and design.  To further elucidate the effect of reactor configuration, operation conditions and permeation parameters on the performance of membrane reactors, a high permselective Pt-composite MR model was developed. Comparison of alumina MR and Pt-composite MR was carried out via computer simulation. Porous membrane reactor with higher permeability but lower Permselectivity can attain comparable conversion as the composite membrane reactor with higher permselectivity but lower permeability. Ptcomposite MR was more superior to alumina MR without recycle. Retentate recycle in alumina MR is shown to outperform the Pt-composite MR. Alumina MR was therefore considered as potential candidate for industrial H2S treatment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical engineering -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Membrane reactors.</field><field name="subject">Membrane separation.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and an intracoronary CD133+ cell infusion in patients with chronic refractory ischaemic heart disease.</field><field name="creator">Kovacic, Jason C., Clinical School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pre-clinical studies suggest that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF) holds promise for the treatment of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). However, its safety and efficacy in this setting, and in particular in patients with chronic refractory 'no-option' IHD, is unclear. Therefore, a clinical study was initiated in 20 such 'no-option' patients, with the aim of assessing the safety and efficacy of both G-CSF administration, and also, that of an intracoronary infusion of G-CSF mobilised CD133+ cells.  The study involved initial baseline cardiac ischaemia assessment (symptom based questionnaire, exercise stress test (EST), nuclear Sestamibi (MIBI) and dobutamine stress echocardiographic (DSE) imaging). Stable 'no-option' IHD patients then received open-label G-CSF commencing at 10&#956;g/kg s/c for five days, with an EST on days four and six (to facilitate myocardial cytokine generation and stem cell trafficking). After three months, cardiac ischaemia assessment and the same regimen of G-CSF and ESTs were repeated, but in addition, leukapheresis and then a randomised double-blinded intracoronary infusion of CD133+ or unselected cells were performed. Final cardiac ischaemia assessment was three months thereafter.  Eighteen male and two female subjects (mean age 62.4) were enrolled. Eight events occurred that fulfilled pre-specified 'adverse event' criteria: four ischaemic (troponin positive) episodes, two episodes of transient thrombocytopaenia (one profound), one episode of gout and one unscheduled hospitalisation for exhaustion. Troponin was positive on 17 further occasions (all CK-MB negative), however, at these instances angina severity was identical to baseline. Importantly, no adverse event(s) resulted in any detectable long-term adverse sequelae for any subject. From baseline to final follow-up, the administration of two cycles of G-CSF was associated with statistically significant improvements in a range of subjective outcomes, including anginal symptoms, quality of life and EST performance (all p &lt; 0.005). However, the  objective MIBI and DSE scans showed only trends towards improvement (all p &gt; 0.1). Compared to unselected cells, an intracoronary infusion of CD133+ cells did not improve either subjective or objective outcomes.  In conclusion, administering G-CSF to patients with refractory 'no-option' IHD warrants careful monitoring, but may be performed with safety. A larger, randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of G-CSF in these patients appears warranted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.</field><field name="subject">Ischaemic heart disease.</field><field name="subject">CD133+</field><field name="subject">Cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crafting connections: original music for the dance in Australia, 1960-2000.</field><field name="creator">Hocking, Rachel, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents the artistic connections made between composers and choreographers in Australia during the period 1960-2000. These 40 years saw a growth in the establishment of dance companies, resulting in many opportunities for composers to write original music for original dance works. The findings of original dance-music are tabulated in an extensive database giving details of 208 composers and over 550 music compositions written specifically for dance. Examples of choreographer and composer collaborative relationships and attitudes to each other???s artforms are discussed. Further examination of how these relationships have affected the sound of the music is detailed in four case studies. These concern the works The Display (music by Malcolm Williamson, choreography by Robert Helpmann, 1964), Poppy (music by Carl Vine, choreography by Graeme Murphy, 1978), Ochres (music by David Page, choreography by Stephen Page, 1994), and Fair Exchanges (music by Warren Burt and Ros Bandt, choreography by Shona Innes, 1989). These case studies look at dancemusic collaborated in different styles: ballet, modern dance, dance-theatre and experimental dance. This discussion is carried out through the analysis of the context of the collaborative relationships, and the temporal and interpretive aspects of the original dance-music. It is found through the investigation of collaborative relationships and discussion of these case studies, that similar methods of writing are used when composing music for theatrical dance, regardless of the type of dance. These methods show that composers have intentionally crafted scores that fulfil needs in the dance works and that are suited to choreographers??? intentions. Importantly, it is also found that involvement with dance has influenced some composers??? styles, aided musical innovation and added significantly to the corpus of Australian music.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music and dance -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Composers -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Choreographers -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Dance music -- Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of brain tissue mechanical properties and cerebrospinal fluid flow in the biomechanics of the normal and hydrocephalic brain</field><field name="creator">Cheng, Shao Koon, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The intracranial system consists of three main basic components - the brain, the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid. The physiological processes of each of these individual components are complex and they are closely related to each other. Understanding them is important to explain the mechanisms behind neurostructural disorders such as hydrocephalus. This research project consists of three interrelated studies, which examine the mechanical properties of the brain at the macroscopic level, the mechanics of the brain during hydrocephalus and the study of fluid hydrodynamics in both the normal and hydrocephalic ventricles. The first of these characterizes the porous properties of the brain tissues. Results from this study show that the elastic modulus of the white matter is approximately 350Pa. The permeability of the tissue is similar to what has been previously reported in the literature and is of the order of 10-12m4/Ns. Information presented here is useful for the computational modeling of hydrocephalus using finite element analysis. The second study consists of a three dimensional finite element brain model. The mechanical properties of the brain found from the previous studies were used in the  construction of this model. Results from this study have implications for mechanics behind the neurological dysfunction as observed in the hydrocephalic patient. Stress fields in the tissues predicted by the model presented in this study closely match the distribution of histological damage, focused in the white matter. The last study models the cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics in both the normal and abnormal ventricular system. The models created in this study were used to understand the pressure in the ventricular compartments. In this study, the hydrodynamic changes that occur in the cerebral ventricular system due to restrictions of the fluid flow at different locations of the cerebral aqueduct were determined. Information presented in this study may be important in the design of more effective shunts. The pressure that is associated with the fluid flow in the ventricles is only of the order of a few Pascals. This suggests that large transmantle pressure gradient may not be present in hydrocephalus.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrospinal fluid</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Neuropeptides -- Mechanism of action</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Models</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Ventricles</field><field name="subject">Hydrocephalus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of female sexuality in chick-lit texts and reading Anais Nin on the train</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Emma Kate, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">My critical essay uses Foucault???s theory of discursive formation to chart the emergence of the figure of the single modern woman as she is created by the various discourses surrounding her. It argues that representations of the single modern woman continue a tradition of perceiving the female body as a source of social anxiety. The project explores ???chick-lit??? as a site within the discursive formation from which the single modern woman emerges as a paradoxical figure; the paradoxes fundamentally linked to her sexuality. This essay, then, essentially seeks to investigate representations of female sexuality within chick-lit, exposing for scrutiny the paradoxes inherent in and around the figure of the single modern woman. My fictional piece is a work of erotica. It is divided into four sections: The Reader, The Writer, The Muse and The Critic. Essentially it explores the relationships between female sexuality and literature; between female sexuality and feminist, post-feminist and patriarchal values and between literature and issues of truth, perspective and representation. The two works complement each other to illuminate the paradox of female sexuality: one from a theoretical perspective and the other from a fictional perspective. The critical work focuses on female sexuality and its relationship to, and development within, the current social context. Chick-lit, as a new and immensely popular genre of fiction which holistically explores the lives of single modern women was useful for examining the relationship between the sexual persona of the single modern woman and society. The fiction is concerned with a narrower focus: specifically the sexual life of the single modern woman. Through the creative process, it became apparent that working within the genre of ???erotica??? would be not only more useful than working within chick-lit, but more powerful in exploring the themes I was interested in. The creative work draws on numerous points of interest raised in the critical work from, for example, the grander notions of the relationship between object and discourse ??? in this case female sexuality and literature ??? and the female body as a source of social fascination and anxiety to finer observations such as what it means to have sex ???like a man.??? In essence, the creative work seeks to examine the many faces of the single modern woman as a sexual being and to illuminate, on an intimate level, the many conflicts between and surrounding those faces and to suggest that while paradox remains in female sexual ideology, the single modern woman will remain suspended in a kind of sexual paralysis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- Sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">Feminism and literature -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australian fiction -- Women authors -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Foucault, Michel -- Contibutions in sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encapsulation of Si:P devices fabricated by scanning tunnelling microscopy</field><field name="creator">Goh, Kuan Eng Johnson, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates the effective use of low temperature molecular beam epitaxy to encapsulate planar Si:P (phosphorus-in-silicon) devices lithographically patterned by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) without significant redistribution of the dopants. To achieve this goal, low temperature magnetotransport is used in combination with STM, Auger electron spectroscopy and secondary ion-mass spectrometry to analyse Si:P ??-doped samples fabricated under different doping and growth conditions. An important aspect of this project is the use of large 1 ?? 1 cm2 Si(001) samples which are about five times larger than standard STM samples. The larger sample size is necessary for post-STM fabrication lithography processes in a cleanroom but presents problems for preparing atomically clean surfaces. The ability to prepare clean and atomically flat Si(001) surfaces for STM lithography on such 1 ?? 1 cm2 samples is demonstrated, and it is shown that Si:P ??-doped layers fabricated on these surfaces exhibit complete electrical activation. Two dopant sources (gaseous PH3 and solid GaP source) were investigated to assess their compatibility with STM-lithography on the H:Si(001) surface. The findings show that while the PH3 and GaP sources result in near identical electrical qualities, only PH3 molecules are compatible with H-resist based lithography for controlled nano-scale doping. For achieving complete activation of the P dopants, it is shown that an anneal to ??? 350 ???C to incorporate P atoms into the Si surface prior to encapsulation is critical. While it is known that the presence of H during growth degrades the quality of Si epitaxy, investigations in this thesis indicate that it has no significant effect on dopant activation. Systematic studies performed to assess the impact of growth temperature recommend an encapsulation temperature of 250 ???C for achieving optimal electrical qualities with minimal dopant segregation. In addition, it is shown that rapid thermal anneals (RTAs) at temperatures &amp;lt 700 ???C provide only marginal improvement in the electrical quality of Si:P ??-doped samples encapsulated at 250 ???C, while RTA temperatures &amp;gt 700 ???C should be avoided due to the high probability of dopant redistribution. To elucidate the nature of 2D transport in Si:P ??-doped devices, a detailed analysis of the low temperature magnetotransport for Si:P ??-doped layers with doping densities in the range ??? 0.2 ??? 2 ?? 1014 cm???2 was carried out. Using conventional 2D theories for disordered systems, both weak localisation (WL) and electron-electron interactions (EEI) are shown to contribute almost equal corrections to the 2D conductivity. In particular, it is found that EEI can introduce a significant correction in the Hall coefficient RH (hence Hall density) especially in the low density/temperature regime and the need to correct for this when using the Hall density to estimate the activated electron density is highlighted. While the electronic mean free path in such highly doped ??-layers is typically &amp;lt 10 nm making ballistic transport in these devices difficult to observe, the phase coherence length can extend to almost 200 nm at about 0.3???0.5 K for doping densities of ??? 1 ??? 2 ?? 1014 cm???2. Finally, the optimised encapsulation strategy developed in this thesis is applied to a 2D square device fabricated by STM. The device exhibits Ohmic conductivity  with complete dopant activation. An analysis of its low temperature magnetotransport shows that the device behaves similarly to a Si:P ??-doped layer encapsulated under similar conditions, thus highlighting that the STM patterning process had no adverse effect on device quality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor doping</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Scanning tunneling microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market probability density functions and investor risk aversion for the australia-us dollar exchange rate.</field><field name="creator">Forrester, David Edward, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis models the Australian-US Dollar (AUD/USD) exchange rate with particular attention being paid to investor risk aversion. Accounting for investor risk aversion in AUD/USD exchange rate modelling is novel, so too is the method used to measure risk aversion in this thesis. Investor risk aversion is measured using a technique developed in Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004), which makes use of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) extracted from option markets. More conventional approaches use forward-market pricing or Uncovered Interest Parity. Several methods of estimating PDFs from option and spot markets are examined, with the estimations from currency spot-markets representing an original application of an arbitrage technique developed in Stutzer (1996) to the AUD/USD exchange rate. The option and spot-market PDFs are compared using their first four moments and if estimated judiciously, the spot-market PDFs are found to have similar shapes to the option-market PDFs. So in the absence of an AUD/USD exchange rate options market, spot-market PDFs can act as a reasonable substitute for option-market PDFs for the purpose of examining market sentiment.  The Relative Risk Aversion (RRA) attached to the AUD/USD, the US Dollar-Japanese Yen, the US Dollar-Swiss Franc and the US-Canadian Dollar exchange rates is measured using the Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004) technique. Amongst these exchange rates, only the AUD/USD exchange rate demonstrates a significant level of investor RRA and only over a weekly forecast horizon. The Bliss and Panigirtzoglou (2004) technique is also used to approximate a time-varying risk premium for the AUD/USD exchange rate. This risk premium is added to the cointegrating vectors of fixed-price and asset monetary models of the AUD/USD exchange rate. An index of Australia???s export commodity prices is also added. The out-of-sample forecasting ability of these cointegrating vectors is tested relative to a random walk using an error-correction framework. While adding the time-varying risk premium improves this forecasting ability, adding export commodity prices does so by more. Further, including both the time-varying risk premium and export commodity prices in the cointegrating vectors reduces their forecasting ability. So the time-varying risk premium is important for AUD/USD exchange rate modelling, but not as important as export commodity prices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foreign exchange -- Econometric models -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Foreign exchange market</field><field name="subject">Capitalists and financiers -- Attitudes -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Exchange rates -- Econometric models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27199</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Being a Good Woman???: suffering and distress through the voices of women in the Maldives</field><field name="creator">Razee, Husna, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study explored the social and cultural context of Maldivian women???s emotional, social and psychological well-being and the subjective meanings they assign to their distress. The central question for the study was: How is suffering and distress in Maldivian women explained, experienced, expressed and dealt with? In this study participant observation was enhanced by lengthy encounters with women and with both biomedical and traditional healers. The findings showed that the suffering and distress of women is embedded in the social and economic circumstances in which they live, the nature of gender relations and how culture shapes these relations, the cultural notions related to being a good woman; and how culture defines and structures women???s place within the family and society. Explanations for distress included mystical, magical and animistic causes as well as social, psychological and biological causes. Women???s experiences of distress were mainly expressed through body metaphors and somatization. The pathway to dealing with their distress was explained by women???s tendency to normalize their distress and what they perceived to be the causes of their distress. This study provides an empirical understanding of Maldivian women???s mental well-being. Based on the findings of this study, a multi dimensional model entitled the Mandala for Suffering and Distress is proposed. The data contributes a proposed foundation upon which mental health policy and mental health interventions, and curricula for training of health care providers in the Maldives may be built. The data also adds to the existing global body of evidence on social determinants of mental health and enhances current knowledge and developments in the area of cultural competency for health care. The model and the lessons learnt from this study have major implications for informing clinicians on culturally congruent ways of diagnosing and managing mental health problems and developing patient-centred mental health services.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women -- Social conditions -- Maldives</field><field name="subject">Women -- Social life and customs -- Maldives</field><field name="subject">Women -- Mental health -- Maldives</field><field name="subject">Women -- Islamic countries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MEMS micro-bridge actuator for potential application in optical switching</field><field name="creator">Michael, Aron, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the development of a novel electro-thermally actuated bi-stable out-of-plane two way actuated buckled micro-bridge for a potential application in optical switching is presented.  The actuator consists of a bridge supported by 'legs' and springs at its four corners. The springs and the bridge are made of a tri-layer structure comprising of 2.5??m thick low-stress PECVD oxide, 1??m thick high-stress PECVD oxide and 2??m thick heavily phosphorus doped silicon. The legs, on the other hand, are 2??m thick single layer heavily phosphorus doped silicon. Both legs and springs provide elastically constrained boundary conditions at the supporting ends, without of which important features of the micro-bridge actuator could not have been achieved. This microbridge actuator is designed, simulated using ANSYS, fabricated and tested. The results from the testing have shown a good agreement with analytical prediction and ANSYS simulation. The actuator demonstrated bi-stability, two-way actuation and 31??m out-of-plane movement between the two-states using low voltage drive. Buckled shape model, design method for bi-stability and thermo-mechanical model are developed and employed in the design of the micro-bridge. These models are compared with Finite Element (FE) based ANSYS simulation and measurements from the fabricated micro-bridge and have shown a good agreement. In order to demonstrate the potential application of this actuator to optical switching, ANSYS simulation studies have been performed on a micro-mirror integrated with the micro-bridge actuator. From these studies, the optimum micro-mirror size that is appropriate for the integration has been obtained. This optimal mirror size ensures the important features of the actuator. Mirror fabrication experiments in (110) wafer have been carried out to find out the appropriate compensation mask size for a given etch depth and the suitable wafer thickness that can be used to fabricate the integrated system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Actuators - Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Microelectromechanical systems -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication -- Switching systems.</field><field name="subject">Optical communications.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flesh-coloured bandaids: politics, discourse, policy and the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples 1972-2001</field><field name="creator">Aldrich, Rosemary, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the relationship between ideology, values, beliefs, politics, language, discourses, public policy and health outcomes. By examining the origins of federal health policy concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples 1972-2001 I have explored the idea that the way a problem is constructed through language determines solutions enacted to solve that problem, and subsequent outcomes. Despite three decades of federal policy activity Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children born at the start of the 21st Century could expect to live almost 20 years less than non-Indigenous Australians. Explanations for the gap include that the colonial legacy of dispossession and disease continues to wreak social havoc and that both health policy and structures for health services have been fundamentally flawed. The research described in this thesis focuses on the role of senior Federal politicians in the health policy process. The research is grounded in theory which suggests that the values and beliefs of decision makers are perpetuated through language. Using critical discourse analysis the following hypotheses were tested: 1. That an examination of the language of Federal politicians responsible for the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples over three decades would reveal their beliefs, values and discourses concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and their health 2. That the discourses of the Federal politicians contributed to policy discourses and frames in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health policy environment, and 3. That there is a relationship between the policy discourses of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health policy environment and health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. The hypotheses were proven. I concluded that there was a relationship between the publicly-expressed values and beliefs of politicians responsible for health, subsequent health policy and resulting health outcomes. However, a model in which theories of discourse, social constructions of people and problems, policy development and organisational decision-making were integrated did not adequately explain the findings. I developed the concept of &amp;quotpolicy imagination&amp;quot to explain the discrete mechanism by which ideology, politics, policy and health were related. My research suggests that the ideology and values which drove decision-making by Federal politicians responsible for the health of all Australians contributed to the lack of population-wide improvement in health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples in the late 20th Century.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Torres Straits Islanders -- Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government policy</field><field name="subject">Torres Straits Islanders -- Government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss of immune regulatory checkpoints in BAFF transgenic mice</field><field name="creator">Groom, Joanna Ruth, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multiple checkpoints control the survival and activation of auto-reactive B cells. The discovery of the TNF family cytokine BAFF has been crucial to understanding peripheral B cell tolerance mechanisms. Homeostatic levels of BAFF are tightly regulated to maintain tolerance in the periphery. Chronically increased levels of BAFF lead to the survival of autoreactive B cells. Autoimmune patients display elevated serum BAFF levels. BAFF Tg mice model this situation with systemically high levels of BAFF and the subsequent development of two separate but related autoimmune syndromes; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj??gren???s syndrome (SS). The work conducted in this thesis further investigates the defects in tolerance down-stream of self-reactive B cell survival, which may contribute to autoimmune disease development in BAFF Tg mice. Expansion of the Marginal zone (MZ) B cell population correlates with the pathogenesis of several models of autoimmune disease. BAFF Tg mice are unique in that they not only display an increased splenic MZ B cell population, but also MZ B cells are found in the salivary glands of mice developing SS. The examination of genes differentially regulated between MZ and Follicular (Fo) B cells led to the investigation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor biology. The expression of S1P receptors was shown to be required for the positioning of MZ B cells in the spleen. Chronic BAFF stimulation alters the retention of MZ B cells through the alteration of S1P receptors and decreased integrin activation. The alteration of S1P receptors and increased ligand sensitivity leads to the accumulation of MZ B cells in the inflamed salivary glands of BAFF Tg mice. This works provides a potential mechanism for the tissue specificity seen in systemic autoimmune disease. The provision of T cell help to auto-reactive B cells is thought to underlie the development of SLE. BAFF Tg mice deficient in T cells surprisingly developed an SLE-like disease indistinguishable from that of BAFF Tg mice. Autoimmunity in BAFF Tg mice did however require signals through the toll-like receptor (TLR)-associated signalling adaptor, MyD88, which controlled the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Therefore, autoimmunity in BAFF Tg mice results from altered B cell tolerance, which requires TLR signalling and is independent of T cell help. It is likely that autoimmune patients with elevated levels of BAFF show a similar basis for disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">B cells</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Transgenic mice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of cortical pathology and clinicopathological correlates in progressive supranuclear palsy</field><field name="creator">Schofield, Emma, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis characterises the cortical pattern of degeneration in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and its consequences. Global atrophy was first examined using a recently developed staging scheme in pathologically-proven PSP cases compared with other tauopathies: gross atrophy was not observed in PSP. Quantification of regional volume loss throughout the brain was then used to determine the magnitude of more focal tissue atrophy in PSP, cortical dysfunction was investigated by measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes, and several cortical cellular pathologies were analysed. Any changes observed were related to each other and clinical assessments of motor, cognitive and behavioural abnormalities. At mid-stage PSP, frontal and subcortical atrophy related to decreased CBF in the frontal cortex and cognitive decline. Parietocerebellar CBF increases were also identified (related to frontal CBF deficits) and related to motor and non-motor deficits. By end-stage PSP, focal atrophy had advanced from frontal and subcortical structures to include atrophy in the parietal lobe. Parietal lobe atrophy related to behavioural abnormalities. Histopathological analysis at end-stage revealed that the cortical atrophy and cell loss does not relate to tau deposition. The focal cortical cell loss related exclusively to motor deficits whilst the more widespread cortical tau deposition related to cognitive and behavioural impairments. Both the tau deposition and these non-motor impairments increased in severity over time. The results show that frontal atrophy and dysfunction occurs rapidly and early in PSP and relate to increasing cognitive deficits. Such deficits appear to cause compensatory CBF enhancement in parietocerebellar regions which then also undergo rapid and severe neurodegeneration. These later changes occur in concert with the more classic PSP symptoms, such as oculomotor features. Throughout the disease, the progressive increase in frontotemporal tau deposition contributes to cognitive and behavioural deficits which become most marked late in the disease. The findings strongly suggest that progressive clinical dysfunction in PSP is directly related to progressive cortical degeneration. Cortical degeneration appears to occur in two independent functional networks. Increased CBF in PSP may be a useful early indicator for future neurodegeneration, although the cellular mechanism leading to cell death requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Progressive supranuclear palsy</field><field name="subject">Nervous system -- Degeneration</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longitudinal study of cognitive and functional brain changes in ageing and cerebrovascular disease, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Ross, Amy, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The neurophysiological basis of cognition changes with age is relatively unexplained, with most studies reporting weak relationships between cognition and measures of brain function, such as event related potentials, brain size and cerebral blood flow. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) is an in vivo method used to detect metabolites within the brain that are relevant to certain brain processes. Recent studies have shown that these metabolites, in particular N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), which is associated with neuronal viability, correlate with performance on neuropsychological tests or other measures of cognitive function in patients with a variety of cognitive disorders associated with ageing and in normal ageing subjects. We have studied the relationship between metabolites and cognitive function in elderly patients 3 months and 3 years after a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and in an ageing comparison group. Metabolites were no different between stroke/TIA patients and elderly controls, however, there were significant metabolite differences between stroke/TIA patients with cognitive impairment (Vascular Cognitive Impairment and Vascular Dementia) and those without. Frontal measures of NAA and NAA/Cr predicted cognitive decline over 12 months and 3 years in stroke/TIA patients and elderly controls, and these measures were superior predictors than structural MRI measures. Longitudinal stability of metabolites in ageing over 3 years was associated with stability of cognitive function. The results indicate that 1H-MRS is a useful tool in differentiating stroke/TIA patients with and without cognitive impairment, with possibly superior predictive ability than structural MRI for assessing future cognitive decline. The changes in 1H-MRS that occur with ageing and cognitive decline have implications for the neurophysiological mechanisms and processes that are occurring in the brain, as well as application to clinical diagnosis, the early detection of pathology and the examination of longitudinal change.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain -- Aging</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Spectroscopic imaging</field><field name="subject">Cognition in old age -- Longitudinal studies</field><field name="subject">Cognition -- Age factors -- Longitudinal studies</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Spectroscoping imaging</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Patients -- Longitudinal studies</field><field name="subject">Brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B and C associated cancer and mortality: New South Wales, 1990-2002.</field><field name="creator">Amin, Janaki, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines cancer and mortality rates among people diagnosed with hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infection in New South Wales (NSW) from 1990 through 2002, by linking hepatitis notifications with the NSW Central Cancer Registry (CCR) and National Death Index.  Of the 39101 HBV, 75834 HCV and 2604 HBV/HCV co-infection notifications included 1052, 1761 and 85 were linked to cancer notifications  and 1233, 4008 and 186 were linked to death notifications respectively. Of 2072 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) notifications to the CCR 323, 267 and 85 were linked to HBV, HCV and HBV/HCV co-infection notifications.  Incidence of HCC was 6.5, 4.0 and 5.9 per 1000 person years for HBV, HCV and HBV/HCV co-infected groups. Risk of HCC in those diagnosed with hepatitis was 20 to 30 times greater than the standard population. There was a marginally statistically significant increased risk of immunoproliferative malignancies associated with HCV infection (SIR=5.6 95% CI 1.8 ???17.5).  Risk of death for those with hepatitis was significantly greater, 1.5 to 5 fold, than the general population with the greatest risk among those with HBV/HCV co-infection. The primary cause of HBV deaths was liver related, particularly HCC, whereas in the HCV groups drug related deaths were most frequent.  Among people with HCV, risk of dying from drug related causes was significantly greater than from liver related causes (p=0.012), with the greatest increased risk in females age 15- 24 years (SMR 56.9, 95%CI 39.2???79.9).  Median age at diagnosis of HCC varied markedly by country of birth and hepatitis group: HBV 66, 63 and  57years ; HCV 51, 68 and 71 years; unlinked 69, 70 and 64 years  for Australian, European, and Asian-born groups, respectively (P&lt;0.0001 for all groups).  While the risk of cancer, particularly HCC, is elevated among people with HBV and HCV infection, the absolute risk remains low. Young people with HCV face a higher mortality risk from continued drug use than from liver damage related to their HCV infection. The influence of IDU in the epidemiology of HCC in New South Wales was possibly reflected in the varying distributions of age and country of birth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Risk factors -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Mortality -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Viral carcinogenesis -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigations on gas explosions in partially confined regions</field><field name="creator">Park, Dal Jae, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary objectives of the described research were to examine the underlying physical phenomena occurring during flame/obstacles interactions in various chambers of low L/D ratio and to develop a new empirical equation for explosion venting.  A literature review suggested that the propagating flame/obstacle interactions in enclosures with large L/D ratio (&amp;gt 2) result in flame acceleration and subsequent pressure build-up during a gas explosion. However, the interactions in practical situations with small L/D &amp;lt 2 were not extensively studied.  In this thesis the first investigation involved the flame interaction with different single and multiple obstacles in a 1/20th model of real enclosure. Results provided the basis for flame propagation, local flame displacement speed probability density functions (pdfs), mean flame velocity and explosion pressure.  The second investigation of the study involved the flame interaction with multiple bars within chambers of different L/D ratios. The results provided mean flame velocities on each stage, as a function of nondimensional time, and pressure developments as a function of L/D ratio.  The final investigation is associated with gas explosion venting. The predictive ability between existing models on explosion venting and experimental results obtained in this thesis were undertaken and found to be deficient. Consequently a new empirical model for predicting explosion venting was developed. The new model was validated with experimental data published in literature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Explosions.</field><field name="subject">Flame.</field><field name="subject">Ventilation.</field><field name="subject">Explosions -- Safety measures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Korea employers' federation and Korean industrial relations</field><field name="creator">Jun, In, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines and explains the development of the KEF between its formation in 1970 and 2003. Using a historical and case study approach, the thesis analyses the strategic behaviours of the KEF. The guiding questions shaping this thesis are drawn from the intersection of resource dependence theory and the literature on employer associations. In response to these questions, chronological narrative explains the development of Korea's political economy and industrial relations between 1970 and 2003 as it affected the KEF. It pays particular attention to the growth of the chaebols -- family-owned and controlled business conglomerates -- as political as well as economic forces, their changing relations with government and their labour management strategies.  This thesis argues that when Korea's chaebol owners formed their association, the KEF, they did so in the absence of immediate clear or concrete challenges to their business interests. Instead, they evaluated the likelihood of some future external challenges and chose to act on these perceptions. In particular, they strategically chose to prepare for the possible re-emergence of an independent labour movement many years into the future rather than trust forever in governments? repressive systems of labour control.  Resource dependence theory proved useful for examining the KEF's internal dynamics. The KEF and its chaebol members were linked through asymmetric inter-dependence. The chaebols dominated KEF membership, took financial responsibility for KEF operations and formally ruled through its governance structure. The KEF's high dependence on the chaebols inhibited any shift away from its chaebol-dominated profile. This also meant that the KEF leadership found it extremely difficult to exert control over member firms' behaviour. However, as the relationship between the chaebols and their external environment changed, internal power resources (industrial relations expertise) and external ones (a militant union movement, tripartite arrangements) helped the KEF Secretariat increase its authority. This allowed it to achieve greater discretionary power in its internal and external domains.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial relations -- Korea (South)</field><field name="subject">Korea (South) -- Politics and government -- 1960-1988.</field><field name="subject">Korea (South) -- Politics and government -- 1988-.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete in seawater and influence of concrete crack width</field><field name="creator">Chang, Zhen-Tian, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a research of the corrosion mechanism and corrosion rate of steel reinforcement in concrete. Experimental results are presented to compare the corrosion behaviours of steel reinforcement in two blended-cement concretes in seawater. The experimental program included a study of the influence of crack width on macrocell corrosion, an investigation of the procedure for the determination of polarisation curves of steel in concrete and, an evaluation of the corrosion rate of steel in concrete and the influence of crack width as determined by a new polarisation curve analysis.  A mechanism is proposed to interpret the different influences, in both the short and long term, of concrete crack width on the macrocell corrosion rate. This mechanism is based on the finding that the corrosion-spread phenomenon is caused by polarisation effects. An oxygen-depletion mechanism is also proposed to explain the much lower macrocell corrosion rate in the slag cement concrete than that in the flyash cement concrete.  The procedure for polarisation testing of steel in concrete is found to be critical to obtaining correct polarisation curves. A twotest procedure is verified to be an appropriate procedure and used in this investigation. Experimental polarisation curves of steel in concrete are found to be very different to those expressed by the kinetic Butler-Volmer equation and, this is considered to be a result of the influence of the passive film on the steel surface in concrete.  An empirical polarisation formula is developed and its interpretation is based on the postulation of two parallel kinetic processes occurring at the steel/passive-film/concrete interface; one is the active corrosion process and the other is the film growth/dissolution process. The formula is used to model experimental polarisation curves of steel in concrete through curvefitting analyses. Good curve-fitting results are obtained between the polarisation test curves and model curves. The results are used for evaluation of the corrosion rate and Tafel behaviours of steel in the two concretes and for assessment of the influence of crack width on the corrosion rate within the crack zone.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Steel -- Corrosion.</field><field name="subject">Seawater corrosion.</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete -- Corrosion.</field><field name="subject">Concrete -- Cracking.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Native title &amp; constitutionalism: constructing the future of indigenous citizenship in Australia</field><field name="creator">Corbett, Lee, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that native title rights are fundamental to Indigenous citizenship in Australia. It does this by developing a normative conception of citizenship in connection with a model of constitutionalism. Here, citizenship is more than a legal status. It refers to the norms of individual rights coupled with democratic responsibility that are attached to the person in a liberal-democracy. Constitutionalism provides the framework for understanding the manner in which Australian society realizes these norms.  This thesis focuses on a society attempting to grapple with issues of postcolonialism. A fundamental question faced in these societies is the legitimacy of group rights based in pre-colonization norms. This thesis argues that these rights can be legitimized when constitutionalism is understood as originating in the deliberations connecting civil society with the state; which deliberations reconcile individual rights with group rights in such a way as to resolve the issue of their competing claims to legitimacy.  Civil society is the social space in which politico-legal norms collide with action. The argument constructed here is that native title is built on norms that have the potential (it is a counterfactual argument) to contribute to a postcolonial civil society. This is one in which colonizer and colonized coordinate their action in a mutual search for acceptable solutions to the question 'how do we live together?'.  The optimistic analysis is tempered by a consideration of the development of native title law. The jurisprudence of the High Court after the Wik's Case has undermined the potential of native title to play a transformative role. It has undermined Indigenous Australians' place in civil society, and their status as equal individuals and responsible citizens. In seeking to explain this, the thesis turns from jurisprudence to political sociology, and argues that an alternative model of constitutionalism and civil society has supplanted the postcolonial; viz., the neoliberal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Land tenure.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Legal status, laws, etc.</field><field name="subject">Native title (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Social policy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An auditory event-related potential study of recovery cycle effects in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder</field><field name="creator">Clunas, Nathan, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies have reported evidence of impaired auditory information processing in patients with schizophrenia. Some of these findings, such as the impaired P50 sensory gating, are consistent with a loss of inhibitory function.  In auditory ERP studies using pairs of stimuli the size of the second response relative to the first response has been taken to indicate the extent to which responsiveness has recovered after a period of time. This variation of responsiveness has been termed the 'recovery cycle,' and is regarded as a measure of the time course of recovery of excitability of cortical neurons after stimulation.  The recovery cycle of the auditory N1 ERP component was measured in 17 patients with schizophrenia and 17 age- and sexmatched healthy volunteers, and 12 patients with bipolar disorder and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Subjects performed a visual distraction task while listening to tone pairs, presented with intra-pair intervals of 1, 3, 5 or 7 s, with inter-pair intervals ranging between 9-13 s. Patients with schizophrenia had significantly reduced N1 amplitudes for S1 stimuli compared to healthy volunteers. For N1 amplitudes elicited by S2 stimuli there was a significant group effect whilst the main effect of intra-pair interval was not significant. A significant quadratic effect across ISI intervals was present in the healthy volunteer group, which was not significant in the schizophrenia group. Patients with bipolar disorder did not differ in N1 amplitudes elicited by S1 stimuli compared to healthy volunteers. There was no evidence of significant group differences in the recovery cycle effect between bipolar patients and matched healthy volunteers.  The results provide evidence of inhibitory auditory processing deficits in schizophrenia, and further suggest that deficits in attention found in patients with schizophrenia, as indexed by reductions of auditory N1 amplitude, may be associated with impairments in inhibitory processes. In addition, different recovery cycle effects were found in patients with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder. Further study of the recovery cycle paradigm used in this study may lead to the development of an objective diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychiatry -- Research.</field><field name="subject">Auditory perception.</field><field name="subject">Schizophrenia.</field><field name="subject">Manic-depressive illness.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) blind system identification for operational modal analysis using the Mean Differential Cepstrum (MDC)</field><field name="creator">Chia, Wee Lee, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The convenience of Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), over conventional Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA), has seen to its increasing popularity over the last decade for the purpose of evaluating dynamic properties of structures.

In this thesis, an OMA method for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) applications in mechanical structures is developed. The aim is to separate MIMO responses into a collection of Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) processes (matrix FRF) using cepstral-based methods, under less restrictive and hence more realistic coloured broadband excitation. Existing cepstral curve-fitting techniques can be subsequently applied to give regenerated FRFs with correct relative scaling.  This cepstral-based method is based on the matrix Mean Differential Cepstrum (MDC) and operates in the frequency domain. Application of the matrix MDC onto MIMO responses leads to a matrix differential equation which together with the use of finite differences, directly solves or identifies the matrix FRF in a propagative manner. An alternative approach based on whitened MIMO responses can be similarly formulated for the indirect solution of the matrix FRF. Both the direct and indirect approaches can be modified with a Taylor series approximation to give a total of four propagative solution sequences.  The method is developed using relatively simple simulated and experimental systems, involving both impulsive and burst random excitations. Detailed analysis of the results is performed using more complicated Single-Input Multiple-Output (SIMO) and MIMO systems, involving both driving and non-driving point measurements. The use of the matrix MDC method together with existing cepstral curve-fitting technique to give correct relative scaling is demonstrated on a simulated MIMO system with coloured inputs. Accurate representation of the actual FRFs is achieved by the matrix MDC technique for SIMO set-ups. In MIMO scenarios, excellent identification was obtained for the case of simulated impulsive input while the experimental and burst random input cases were less favourable. The results show that the matrix MDC technique works in MIMO scenarios, but possible noise-related issues need to be addressed in both experimental and burst random input cases for a more satisfactory identification outcome.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modal analysis.</field><field name="subject">Structural dynamics -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital technique.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEFT guessing: using inductive transfer to improve rule evaluation from limited data</field><field name="creator">Reid, Mark Darren, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Algorithms that learn sets of rules describing a concept from its examples have been widely studied in machine learning and have been applied to problems in medicine, molecular biology, planning and linguistics. Many of these algorithms used a separate-and-conquer strategy, repeatedly searching for rules that explain different parts of the example set. When examples are scarce, however, it is difficult for these algorithms to evaluate the relative quality of two or more rules which fit the examples equally well. This dissertation proposes, implements and examines a general technique for modifying rule evaluation in order to improve learning performance in these situations. This approach, called Description-based Evaluation Function Transfer (DEFT), adjusts the way rules are evaluated on a target concept by taking into account the performance of similar rules on a related support task that is supplied by a domain expert. Central to this approach is a novel theory of task similarity that is defined in terms of syntactic properties of rules, called descriptions, which define what it means for rules to be similar. Each description is associated with a prior distribution over classification probabilities derived from the support examples and a rule's evaluation on a target task is combined with the relevant prior using Bayes' rule. Given some natural conditions regarding the similarity of the target and support task, it is shown that modifying rule evaluation in this way is guaranteed to improve estimates of the true classification probabilities. Algorithms to efficiently implement Deft are described, analysed and used to measure the effect these improvements have on the quality of induced theories. Empirical studies of this implementation were carried out on two artificial and two real-world domains. The results show that the inductive transfer of evaluation bias based on rule similarity is an effective and practical way to improve learning when training examples are limited.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine learning.</field><field name="subject">Transfer learning.</field><field name="subject">Inductive transfer.</field><field name="subject">Empirical Bayes.</field><field name="subject">Multitask learning.</field><field name="subject">Computer programming.</field><field name="subject">Logic programming.</field><field name="subject">Induction (Logic)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a mathematical N-line model for simulation of beach changes</field><field name="creator">Dang, Van To, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of a new N-Line model, which provides a practical tool for simulating regional beach changes induced by short and long-term processes, is described in this thesis. The new N-Line model consists of four main modules that together describe the hydrodynamic and morphological responses. The four constituent modules have been integrated based on a wide range of research including the utility and function of commercial or freeware models. They are RCPWAVE wave module, time-averaged and depth-integrated current module, sediment transport module based on Bailard (1981) and contour change morphological module. Two different time-scales and two staggered grid systems for hydrodynamic and morphological simulations were adopted alternatively. For short-term 2D profile changes, new N-Line model applicability has been examined using data from the laboratory to the field. For ideal beaches, new N-Line can simulate an offshore storm bar generation or an onshore accretion due to high or low energy waves. For SUPERTANK large-scale flume data, the predicted profile matched the measured profile well, especially the bar height and position. For beach profile data from the Gold Coast, storm-induced variations of barred profiles were reasonably modelled. The new N-Line model compared well with other commonly used cross-shore models such as SBEACH and UNIBEST. A new schematisation for a non-monotonic profile and DUNED inclusion were introduced. Sensitivity tests on cross-shore sediment coefficient (Kq), smoothing parameter (??s) and water level fluctuations were performed. For long-term 3D beach changes, the new N-Line model applicability has been tested with various boundary conditions using idealized and real field data. Two periods, 17 and 16 months, of beach changes before and after a major bypass plant commenced operation in 2001 at Letitia Spit were simulated. The profile and shoreline changes were predicted reasonably well. Empirical model parameters were determined after a range of sensitivity and calibration testing. The new N-Line model showed its better performance compared to one-line models. It can handle various boundary conditions, especially bypass conditions. The N-Line model is not only capable of modelling planform variations but also cross-shore profile changes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coast changes -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Shirelines -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of carbon nanotube modified electrodes</field><field name="creator">Chou, Alison, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis is concerned with electrodes modified with carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes have been characterised with special emphasis on the oxygenated species generated from cutting in acid mixtures. Several different techniques have been used for the analysis, especially infrared spectroscopy (IR) in combination with X-ray spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in combination with atomic force microscopy (AFM). TEM analyses were used to reveal the morphological differences between various nanotube cutting times. The lengths of the nanotube were found to decrease with increasing cutting time. Electrochemical measurements were performed on carbon nanotube modified electrodes using nanotubes of different cutting time. The peak separation of ferricyanide redox reaction was found to depend strongly on the length of nanotube and also on the orientation of nanotube at the interface. Whilst at the randomly dispersed, the peak separation showed a decrease with decreasing nanotube length, vertically aligned nanotubes showed no dependence of the peak separation on the nanotube length. Electrochemical results together with spectroscopy measurements show that the highly electroactive edge planes were located on the carbon nanotubes and the oxygenated species in the ends of the nanotubes from cutting in acid mixtures were responsible for the good electrochemical properties. Bamboo-shaped carbon nanotube is a morphological variation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes where the graphite planes are formed at an angle to the axis of the tube. Glassy carbon electrodes modified with bambootype carbon nanotubes showed greater electrochemical signal compared with electrodes modified with singlewalled carbon nanotubes due to the edge planes of graphite located at regular intervals along the walls of the bamboo-shaped carbon nanotube, thus confirming the importance of the ends of nanotube in controlling the kinetics of electron transfer events. Effect of nanotube orientation was studied using ferrocenemethylamine attached to randomly dispersed and vertically aligned nanotubes. The electron transfer kinetics was found to depend strongly on the orientation of the nanotube with the electron transfer at the randomly dispersed slower than vertically aligned. Results were addressed using the analogy that the ends of the nanotubes are like the ends of the tubes can be described as edge-plane-like whilst the tube walls are basal-plane-like. Difference in electron transfer kinetics suggested that the electron transfer in nanotubes could occur via two different pathways: through the edge plane-like opening of the nanotube or by hopping across the walls of the nanotube.  Triton X-100 was used to dialyse the acid cut nanotubes. XPS analysis of dialysed nanotubes was compared with non-dialysed nanotubes. A reduced concentration of sulfate ions was found in the dialysesd sample. Nitrate ion (407 eV) was removed after dialysis. Amino groups (400 ev) and protonated amino-group (402 eV) both seemed to be removed slowly by dialysis. Theses ions could be ascribed to residual ions trapped inside nanotubes from cutting in acid mixtures. The electrochemical response of ferrocenemethylamine was also studied. The electron transfer rate constants were rate constants were higher at dialysed nanotube assembly than non-dialysed, which was attributed to doping effect incurred from cutting. Electron transfer between nanotube and gold electrode surface was studied by attaching nanotubes to linker length of 6, 8, and 11 carbons. The results were exploited to rationalise the role of the chemical structure of the nanotubes in facilitating electron transfer from the redox species to the electrode surface that was otherwise suppressed without the presence of nanotubes. The observed redox activity was a consequence of resonant electron transfer from the LUMO of the acceptor to the HOMO of the donor under the influence of an applied voltage, assuming the nanotube modified electrode behaves similarly to the metal-molecule-metal junction mode.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrodes, Carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanotubes</field><field name="subject">Electrochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction, expression and characterisation of a human anti-CD48 monoclonal antibody</field><field name="creator">Wei, Jiewei, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Monoclonal antibodies and antibody-based entities are a major class of therapeutic proteins. The surge in development of monoclonal antibodies is predominantly due to the utilization of technologies for producing fully human antibodies, namely phage display and transgenic mice with human humoral immune systems. Human CD48, a cell-surface adhesion molecule, is a potential tumor target for the treatment of white blood cell malignancies, principally leukemia and lymphoma. A truncated, secreted form of CD48 was expressed in CHO cells, and was shown to bind to existing anti- CD48 murine antibodies. A human anti-CD48 scFv antibody fragment, (designated scFv-N2A) was previously isolated using phage display technology from a synthetic human scFv immunoglobulin gene library. The scFv-N2A was reassembled as a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (designated IgG1-N2A), expressed in CHO cells and the binding of IgG1-N2A to recombinant CD48 was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, surface plasmon resonance and fluorescence activated cell sorting. IgG1-N2A binding to CD48 on Raji cells showed that the specificity of the human antibody for GPI-linked CD48 was conserved. In biological studies using a human lymphoma cell line (Raji), it was found that the IgG1-N2A antibody was able to induce potent growth inhibition, with a 68% reduction in viable cells. Furthermore, Raji cells treated with IgG1-N2A showed evidence of increased ethidium bromide uptake and cell shrinkage, which are characteristics associated with direct induction of apoptosis. The data suggests the novel human anti-CD48 IgG1-N2A monoclonal antibody can block proliferation and promote apoptosis of lymphoma cells, and therefore has potential as a lead antibody candidate for the treatment of white blood cell malignancies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibodies</field><field name="subject">Immunotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of tissue factor in renal ischaemia reperfusion injury</field><field name="creator">Sevastos, Jacob, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Reperfusion injury may mediate renal dysfunction following ischaemia. A murine model was developed to investigate the role of the tissue factor-thrombin-protease activated receptor pathway in renal ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI). In this model, mice received 25 minutes of ischaemia and subsequent periods of reperfusion. C57BL6, protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) knockout mice, and tissue factor (TF) deficient mice were used. Following 24 hours IRI, PAR-1 deficiency resulted in protection against severe renal failure compared to the C57BL6 mice (creatinine, 118.2 ?? 6.3 vs 203 ?? 12 ??mol/l, p&amp;lt0.001). This was confirmed by lesser tubular injury. By 48 hours IRI, this resulted in a survival benefit (survival, 87.5% vs 0%, p&amp;lt0.001). Treatment of C57BL6 mice with hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor, offered renoprotection at 24 hours IRI (creatinine, 107 ?? 10 ??mol/l, p&amp;lt0.001), leading to a 60% survival rate at 48 hours IRI (p&amp;lt0.001). TF deficient mice expressing less than 1% of C57BL6 mouse TF were also protected (creatinine, 113.6 ?? 7 ??mol/l, p&amp;lt0.001), with a survival benefit of 75% (p&amp;lt0.001). The PAR-1 knockout, hirudin treated C57BL6 and TF deficient mice had reduced myeloperoxidase activity and tissue neutrophil counts compared to the C57BL6 mice, along with reduced KC and MIP-2 chemokine mRNA and protein expression. Hirudin treatment of PAR-1 knockout mice had no additional benefit over PAR-1 absence alone, suggesting no further contribution by activation of other protease activated receptors (creatinine at 24 hours IRI, 106.5 ?? 10.5 ??mol/l, p&amp;gt0.05). Furthermore, immunofluoresence staining for fibrin(ogen) showed no difference between C57BL6 and PAR-1 knockout mice, suggesting no major contribution by fibrin in this model. Renal IRI resulted in increased levels of TF mRNA expression in the C57BL6, PAR-1 knockout, and hirudin treated C57BL6 mice compared to normal controls, suggesting that TF mRNA expression was upregulated in this model. This resulted in increased TF functional activity in the C57BL6 and PAR-1 knockout mice, but TF activity was negligible in hirudin treated C57BL6 and TF deficient mice. The data therefore suggests that the TF-thrombin cascade contributes to renal IRI by signalling via PAR-1 that then regulates chemokine gene expression and subsequent neutrophil recruitment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Wounds and injuries</field><field name="subject">Reperfusion injury -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Ischemia -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Society building - welfare, time and social capital</field><field name="creator">Patulny, Roger, Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Social capital is a relatively new concept compared to welfare, though debates on the advantages of different welfare regimes and the links between state provision and social participation are tentatively connecting the two areas. Esping-Andersen classifies welfare regimes into three types - market-focused liberal, status-focused corporatist, and equality-focused social democratic regimes. Each has been well studied with regards to the effects of commodification (market dependency), stratification (inequality and stigma), and familialisation (paternalistic family dependency). However, such focus largely upon economic rather than social concerns. This thesis examines the proposition that welfare can ???build society??? by promoting these social aspects otherwise known as social capital. The social capital concept has definition and measurement problems with causality and the capture of social activities rather than just norms. Acknowledging, this, social capital is preferably defined from the literature as norms of trust, networks of association membership, and practices of volunteering and socialising. A critical reading highlights the importance of separating bonding social capital, as captured in Bourdieu and Coleman???s exclusive networks, from bridging social capital, more akin to Putnam???s civil society and thus closer to social welfare. This thesis examines numerous empirical measures of bridging social capital, by looking at norms and networks through the World Values Survey, and practices through the Multinational Time Use Study across nine OECD countries. Results show that social democratic welfare regimes do promote social capital, with high levels of trust, membership and social activity. Corporatist welfare regimes show low but constant levels of social capital, whilst liberal welfare regimes have experienced declines in trust. Increasingly means-tested liberal regimes register high levels of commodification, with poor work-leisure balances, and are also more stratified with higher levels of inequality, whilst attitudes stigmatising immigrants and the poor are apparent amongst all less trusting countries. Familialisation is explicit in corporatist values and male/female work imbalances, and implicit in liberal values and poor family payments, with reduced social capital contributions from women as a result. Overall empirical testing of relations between welfare regimes and social capital show that both are linked most positively under universal rather than meanstested conditions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology)</field><field name="subject">Social welfare</field><field name="subject">Social networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The malarial carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II gene as a target for DNAzyme therapy</field><field name="creator">Katrib, Marilyn, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Today, malaria remains the biggest killer of the third world, killing over a million people every year, despite intensive research efforts. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPSII) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in pyrimidine biosynthesis of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria. PfCPSII is a unique target for DNAzyme therapy due to the presence of two unique insertion sequences of 700bp and 1800bp that exist within the mature mRNA transcript. Previous studies have demonstrated that exogenous delivery of nucleic acids such as ribozymes and DNAzymes targeting PfCPSII insertion II effectively inhibited the growth of P. falciparum cultures at sub-micromolar levels.  The objective of this study was to investigate the insertion sequences within CPSII from rodent malaria species P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii in order to further validate the insertions as DNAzyme targets in vivo. In addition, the insertions were isolated from another human malaria parasite, P. vivax. All Plasmodium CPSII genes investigated encoded two highly hydrophilic insertion sequences of similar size and nature, in the precise position seen in PfCPSII. Although these insertions are poorly conserved, border and internal regions of high homology are present.  Thirty-one new DNAzymes were designed to target the P. berghei CPSII insertion II region, seventeen of which demonstrated the ability to cleave the target RNA. Of these, four showed significant cleavage activity, with the DNAzyme MD14 cleaving greater than half the target RNA within five minutes. These DNAzymes were then further characterised for kinetic behaviour. Again, MD14 displayed favourable kinetics of cleavage and was chosen as a suitable candidate in an in vivo rodent malaria trial.  Analysis of parasitaemia from the MD14 treated mice indicated the administration of MD14 effected a highly statistically significant reduction of parasitaemia, although this reduction was low (6.3%). More efficient DNAzyme delivery methods were investigated in order to improve DNAzyme efficacy and included the novel use of porphyrin conjugated DNAzymes. The porphyrin-conjugated DNAzymes improved uptake into parasitised red blood cells and significantly reduced parasite growth in vitro at nanomolar levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaria -- Drug therapy.</field><field name="subject">Genetics -- Research.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of drying on anthocyanins in blueberries</field><field name="creator">Lohachoompol, Virachnee, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Blueberries are well known for their high anthocyanin content and the health benefits. Fresh blueberries have limited shelf life and thus are kept frozen or processed. Since freezing is expensive, low cost processing methods, particularly drying are being devised. Various drying treatments were compared with regard to drying time and quality of the dried product in terms of anthocyanin and polyphenolic contents as well as antioxidant activity. The drying treatments involved high temperature in a cabinet dryer and low temperature in a heat pump dryer. Freeze drying was used as a reference treatment. Highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum L., cultivars Crunchie, Star, and Sharpe) and rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei, cultivars Climax, Powderblue, and Brightwell) blueberries were used in this study. Pre-treatments included osmotic dehydration or skin abrasion. The temperature and concentration of the osmotic solution were the main parameters contributing to the reduction of drying time. Mechanical skin abrasion was more effective than osmotic dehydration in reducing drying time and minimising the loss of anthocyanin and phenolic contents of the blueberries in air drying treatments. The thickness of cuticle and the structure of epicuticular waxes affected the drying rate of different cultivars of blueberries. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was used to identify different anthocyanins in the blueberry samples. Delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin were the main contributors to the total anthocyanin content of the fresh and dried samples. Degradation products of anthocyanins were observed in samples where the anthocyanin contents declined as a result of drying treatments. The anthocyanin content and profile, phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of mulberries (Morus nigra), and Makiang (Cleistocalyx nervosum), a Thai native fruit, were also analysed. There was no significant difference between total anthocyanin content of blueberries and mulberries. In contrast, the total phenolic content and antioxidant effect of mulberry were significantly higher than those of blueberries and Makiang. Skin abrasion and high temperature drying resulted in the fastest drying rate and highest anthocyanin retention. Anthocyanin profiles differed in various cultivars of blueberries. Within the same cultivar, amounts of each anthocyanin varied with pre-treatments and drying methods but the distribution of monomeric anthocyanins was similar.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blueberries.</field><field name="subject">Food -- Preservation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Stem Cell Pathway??? gene expression in human foetal limbus and cadaveric human limbal epithelium</field><field name="creator">Figueira, Edwin C, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stem cells play a vital role in the turn over of permanently self-renewing tissues (e.g. corneal epithelium, epidermis, bone marrow). Stratified cornea epithelia serve, as ideal tissue models for studying ???stemness???, as the site of cells in the different stages of differentiation are anatomically easily identifiable. Studies targeting limbal stem cell maintenance, in-vitro gene expression during storage and differentiation will benefit future therapeutic applications (e.g. corneal transplantation). Knowledge of stem cell behaviour will help explain the pathophysiology of corneal related ocular surface disorders (e.g. idiopathic limbal stem cell deficiency, pterygium and limbal dermoids), establish new treatment modalities (e.g. allogenic cellular transplants) and help promote invivo expansion of residual stem cell populations in deficiency states. The major obstacle in the progress of research on limbal stem cells is the lack of knowledge of phenotypic markers of limbal epithelial stem cells. This project first studied the limbal expression of phenotypic markers that were discovered in other human adult and embryonic stem cell populations using microarray differential expression studies. Gene expression profiles of the relatively primitive human foetal limbus were compared with that of the central cornea. Microarray was also performed to identify the differential gene expression profile of cultured primary human limbal epithelial cells, when compared to the limbal epithelial cell population isolated after 5 serial cultures. 33 genes were upregulated in the human foetal limbus and primary cultured human limbal epithelium, when compared respectively to the central foetal  cornea (first experiment) and the limbal epithelial cell population after the 5th trypsin passaged culture (second experiment). Four foetal limbal and primary limbal epithelial upregulated genes (CK15, CK14, Cdh3, and Wnt4) were confirmed to be upregulated by semi quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical experiments on the human foetal cornea, adult human cadaveric cornea and cultured human limbal epithelial cells. The microarray defined phenotypic profile of both the foetal limbus and cultured adult limbal epithelial cells will help identify these cells in in-vitro and in-vivo states. The expression of these 4 selected markers in the limbal dermoid and pterygium suggests that limbal epithelial cells containing a stem cell population are involved in the pathogenesis of these two disorders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stem cells -- Research</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27455</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of p53 in the drug resistance phenotype of childhood neuroblastoma</field><field name="creator">Xue, Chengyuan, School of Women?s &amp; Children?s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is the main obstacle to the successful treatment of many cancers, including childhood neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumour of infants. One factor that may play a role in determining response of neuroblastoma tumours to therapeutic agents is the p53 tumour suppressor gene. A number of previous studies have suggested that this tumour suppressor protein is inactive in neuroblastoma due to its cytoplasmic sequestration. This thesis therefore has examined the functionality of p53 and its role in determining drug response of neuroblastoma cells. An initial study was undertaken that characterised an unusually broad multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of a neuroblastoma cell line (IMR/KAT100). The results demonstrated that the MDR phenotype of the IMR/KAT100 cells was associated with the acquisition of mutant p53. To explore the role of p53 in drug resistance further, p53-deficient variants in cell lines with wild-type p53 were generated by transduction of p53-suppressive constructs encoding either shRNA or a dominant-negative p53 mutant. Analysis of these cells indicated that: (i) in contrast to previous reports, wild-type p53 was fully functional in all neuroblastoma lines tested, as evidenced by its activation and nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage, transactivation of target genes and control of cell cycle checkpoints; (ii) inactivation of p53 in neuroblastoma cells resulted in establishment of an MDR phenotype; (iii) knockdown of mutant p53 did not revert the drug resistance phenotype, suggesting it is determined by loss of wild-type function rather than gain of mutant function; (iv) p53-dependent cell senescence, the primary response of S-type neuroblastoma cells to DNA damage, is replaced, after p53 inactivation, by mitotic catastrophe and subsequent apoptosis. In contrast to neuroblastoma, p53 suppression had no effect or increased drug susceptibility in several other tumour cell types, indicating the importance of tissue context for p53- mediated modulation of tumour cell sensitivity to treatment. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence for p53 having a role in mediating drug resistance in neuroblastoma and suggest that p53 status may be an important prognostic marker of treatment response in this disease.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance in cancer cells.</field><field name="subject">Multidrug resistance.</field><field name="subject">p53 antioncogene.</field><field name="subject">Tumors in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My truth: women speak cancer</field><field name="creator">Housel, Rebecca Anne, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">1) My Truth: Women Speak Cancer is a creative nonfiction based on three years of interviews with twelve survivors told through the lens of the author's experience as a three-time, sixteen-year survivor of multiple cancers.

Given a sequence of noisy observations, the machine forms a piecewise linear approximation to the nonlinear dynamic equations that are assumed to describe the real world. A number of existing online system identification techniques are examined, but it is found that they all either scale poorly with dimensionality, have a number of parameters that make them difficult to apply, or do not learn sufficiently accurate approximations.  Therefore a novel framework is developed for learning linear model trees in both batch and online settings. The algorithms are evaluated empirically on a number of commonly used benchmark datasets, a simple test function, and three dynamic domains ranging from a simple pendulum to a complex flight simulator. The new batch algorithm is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms and is seen to perform favourably overall. The new incremental model tree learner also compares well with a recent online function approximator from the literature.  Armed with a tool for effectively constructing piecewise linear models of the environment, a control framework is developed that learns trajectories from a demonstrator and attempts to follow these trajectories within each linear region usinglinear quadratic control. The induced controllers are able to swing up and balance a simple forced pendulum both in simulation and in the real world. They can also swing up and balance a real double pendulum. The induced controllers are empirically shown to perform better than the original demonstrator, and could therefore be used to either replace a human operator or improve upon an existing automatic controller. In addition an ability to generalise the learnt trajectories enables the system to perform novel tasks. This is demonstrated on a flight simulator where, having observed an aircraft flying several times around a circuit, the controller is able to copy the take-off procedure, fly a completely new circuit that includes new manoeuvres, and successfully land the plane.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic control.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving throughput and fairness of on-board mobile networks.</field><field name="creator">Baig, Adeel, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has recently released network mobility standards that allow deployment of TCP/IP networks onboard a vehicle and maintain permanent network connectivity to the Internet via a vehicular mobile router. This recent development opens up new opportunities for providing efficient mobile computing for users on the move, especially for commuters traveling on public transports. Moreover, central and coordinated management of mobility in a single router, rather than by each user device individually, has numerous advantages. In this architecture, however, it becomes challenging to guarantee network performance due to the mobility of the network and inherently vulnerable nature of wireless links. In this thesis, a detailed performance study of onboard networks is conducted. It has been shown that disruptions in the mobile router connectivity can significantly degrade network throughput. Moreover, factors such as the limited wireless bandwidth of the access link, variations in the bandwidth due to technology switching, and the communication diversity of onboard users all contribute to the problem of unfair sharing of wireless bandwidth. By leveraging the fact that all onboard communications go through the mobile router, performance enhancing solutions are proposed that can be deployed in the mobile router to transparently address the throughput and fairness problems. In this architecture, when the route is known in advance and repetitive (e.g. for public transport or a regularly commuting private vehicle), a certain degree of prediction of impending link disruptions is possible. An anticipatory state freezing mechanism is proposed that relies on the prediction of link disruptions to freeze and unfreeze the state machine of TCP, the widely used transport protocol in the Internet. Simulation study shows that TCP throughput has a non-linear relationship with the prediction accuracy. As prediction accuracy increases, throughput problem diminishes quickly. An adaptive mobile router based fairness control mechanism is proposed to address the unfair sharing of wireless bandwidth in highly dynamic scenarios. The fairness is controlled by dynamically estimating the round-trip-times of all onboard TCP connections and transparently adjusting the protocol control parameters at the router. The thesis also discusses implementation issues for the proposed solutions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Network performance (Telecommunication)</field><field name="subject">Routers (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software architecture evaluation for framework-based systems.</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Liming, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Complex modern software is often built using existing application frameworks and middleware frameworks. These frameworks provide useful common services, while simultaneously imposing architectural rules and constraints. Existing software architecture evaluation methods do not explicitly consider the implications of these frameworks for software architecture. This research extends scenario-based architecture evaluation methods by incorporating framework-related information into different evaluation activities. I  propose four techniques which target four different activities within a scenario-based architecture evaluation method.  1) Scenario development: A new technique was designed aiming to extract general scenarios and tactics from framework-related architectural patterns. The technique is intended to complement the current scenario development process. The feasibility of the technique was validated through a case study. Significant improvements of scenario quality were observed in a controlled experiment conducted by another colleague. 2) Architecture representation: A new metrics-driven technique was created to reconstruct software architecture in a just-in-time fashion. This technique was validated in a case study. This approach has significantly improved the efficiency of architecture representation in a complex environment. 3) Attribute specific analysis (performance only): A model-driven approach to performance measurement was applied by decoupling framework-specific information from performance testing requirements. This technique was validated on two platforms (J2EE and Web Services) through a number of case studies. This technique leads to the benchmark producing more representative measures of the eventual application. It  reduces the complexity behind the load testing suite and framework-specific performance data collecting utilities. 4) Trade-off and sensitivity analysis: A new technique was designed seeking to improve the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) for trade-off and sensitivity analysis during a framework selection process. This approach was validated in a case study using data from a commercial project.  The approach can identify 1) trade-offs implied by an architecture alternative, along with the magnitude of these trade-offs. 2) the most critical decisions in the overall decision process 3) the sensitivity of the final decision and its capability for handling quality attribute priority changes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software architecture -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Software architecture -- Reliability</field><field name="subject">Component software -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Component software -- Reliability</field><field name="subject">Computer software -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Computer software -- Quality control</field><field name="subject">Software measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-induced protein wasting and potential treatment with anabolic hormoness</field><field name="creator">Burt, Morton Garth, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Protein wasting is a complication of glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. It causes substantial morbidity and there is no treatment. This thesis investigates the metabolic mechanisms underlying GC-induced protein wasting and the potential for anabolic hormones to reverse protein loss. The models of GC excess were Cushing's syndrome and GC therapy. Whole body protein metabolism was assessed using the leucine turnover technique and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to estimate lean body mass (LBM) and fat mass (FM).  As previous studies demonstrated that LBM and FM influenced rates of protein metabolism, the magnitude of body compositional abnormality in Cushing's syndrome was determined. After accounting for the greater FM (30%) and lesser LBM (15%), protein metabolism in Cushing's syndrome was characterised by a significant increase in protein oxidation, an abnormality that leads to irreversible protein loss. Successful treatment of Cushing's syndrome normalised protein oxidation.  Studies of the acute and chronic effects of therapeutic GCs revealed a time-dependent effect on protein metabolism. GCs acutely increased protein oxidation. However, the rate of protein oxidation during chronic therapy at a similar dose was not significantly different to untreated control subjects. This time-dependent change suggests that GC-induced stimulation of protein oxidation does not persist and could represent a metabolic adaptation to limit protein loss. This finding contrasts with that in Cushing's syndrome, where protein oxidation is persistently elevated. This difference may represent a dose effect.  Studies in GH-deficient subjects revealed that GH induced a fall in protein oxidation that was significantly correlated with a subsequent gain in LBM. This suggests that the anabolic potential of a therapeutic substance can be predicted by its ability to suppress protein oxidation acutely.  Finally, the potential for GH and androgens to reverse the metabolic effects of GCs was assessed. A preliminary study in GC users revealed that a GH dose of 0.8 mg/d was effective in reducing protein oxidation. In a subsequent study, the GH-induced reduction in protein oxidation in women on GCs was enhanced by combined treatment with dehydroepiandrosterone, an androgen.  In summary, GCs induce protein loss by stimulating protein oxidation. GH reverses this effect and this action is enhanced by coadministration of androgens. GH and androgens may be used therapeutically to prevent protein loss induced by GCs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glucocorticoids -- Therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Metabolism.</field><field name="subject">Body composition.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Oxidation.</field><field name="subject">Cushing's syndrome -- Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated method of vocal development: a theoretical and empirical study</field><field name="creator">Gullaer, Irene, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">The integrated method proposed and worked out consisted of integration of vocal and voice-speech teaching techniques as well as integration of the empirical and mechanical methods of teaching. Balance and co-ordination between external and intra-pharyngeal articulation were considered as a framework for integration of various methods of teaching. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with spectral analysis, was used to demonstrate the work of intrapharyngeal muscles while singing and to assess the quality of vocalization. 54 MRI expositions were generated for the set of vowels, pitches and modes, of which over 400 MRI images were synthesized and measured. When switching from amateur to professional way of singing, radical transformations of size, shape and to some extent, changes in the surface properties (density, porosity) of muscular tissue of intra-pharyngeal cavities were observed. New acquired MR images clearly showed that the axial section of the back cavity appears indeed much larger in the professional mode than in the amateur mode. Statistical analysis showed that this difference is statistically significant. It is shown that the work on muscles development and use of mental images/imagination must progress in close collaboration. The strategy for the gradual mastering technique of the opening of the vocal tract was suggested, and developed. A new approach was developed to be applied for students to get stable repeatability when they work with mental images. Obtained MR images were used as a part of visualization method during experimental work with students. MR images helped students to create proper mental images. The theory of tangible images was suggested and then successfully applied in the form of experimental work with students. Experimental work with students of the ethnic group Maori was conducted.  This experimental work with Maori students demonstrated that the integrated method of teaching helped to overcome some physiological and psychological specific problems which require special techniques of training. Case studies were carried out to assess individual and students' group perceptions, along with interview techniques and a survey questionnaire.  The results of the survey are presented graphically, and statistical processing of the data was performed.

However, the overall efficacy of these programs has been compromised by implementation failure and a focus on abstinence based outcomes. The current thesis attempted to overcome such concerns by developing a computer-delivered school-based alcohol prevention program founded on a harm-minimisation approach. The aims of this thesis were to assess whether (1) this program would be both a feasible and acceptable means of overcoming the obstacles encountered in the implementation of school-based drug prevention programs, and (2) it was effective in decreasing alcohol misuse and related harm.  CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was developed in collaboration with teachers, students and relevant health and legal professionals. The final curriculum based program consists of six lessons, each with two components. The first component involves students completing an interactive computer-based program, with the second consisting of a variety of individual, small group and class-based activities.  The feasibility and efficacy of CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was assessed utilising a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 1434, Year 8 students (13 years old) from sixteen schools. CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was found to be both feasible and acceptable in the school setting. The provision of alcohol prevention information in the background of a computerised teenage drama provided young people with an education program they enjoyed in a context to which they could relate. Teachers reported a willingness to implement CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module in routine practice. They believed it to be a high quality program which was superior to other drug education programs.  CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module led to significant increases in knowledge of harm minimisation skills and subdued alcohol related expectancies. It was effective in reducing alcohol use, misuse and related harms for females, but not for males. The differential effects of gender are extensively discussed and implications for future research considered. CLIMATE Schools: Alcohol Module was clearly both feasible and acceptable and has the potential to offer an innovative new platform for the delivery of prevention programs in schools.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teenagers -- Alcohol use -- Australia -- Prevention -- Computer-assisted instruction.</field><field name="subject">High school students -- Alcohol use -- Australia -- Prevention -- Computer-assisted instruction.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Studey and teaching -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholism -- Australia -- Prevention -- Computer-assisted instruction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of systems of access to important high cost medicines: a critical analysis of the nationally subsidised scheme of access to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in Australia</field><field name="creator">Lu, Christine Yi-Ju, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Access to &amp;quot high-cost medicines&amp;quot under Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is characterised by strict eligibility criteria. The PBS access scheme for the anti-rheumatic biologicals (etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab) was examined for concordance with Australia?s National Medicines Policy. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with a range of stakeholders were conducted. National, aggregated prescription and expenditure data from Medicare Australia and dispensing data from the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee were analysed. Access to biologicals was also examined from an ethical perspective.  Results: Interviewees agreed that controlled access to high-cost medicines was broadly equitable and practical but specific concerns included: timeliness of access; bureaucracy of the process; contentious cases of individual patients being denied access; insufficient patient information; the quantum of resources required to administer the access scheme; inadequate stakeholder consultation. The access requirement of a history of failure of conventional anti-rheumatic drugs was supported. Recommendations included proactive review of the access criteria and outcomes; greater transparency and formal stakeholder involvement to increase public confidence in the definition of &amp;quot target patient population" and a formal appeal mechanism to increase the fairness and accountability of the PBS. Establishment of an appeal mechanism is supported by &amp;quot accountability for reasonableness&amp;quot framework grounded in procedural justice. Data needed to examine the health outcomes associated with the use of biologicals on a national level was not easily available. This shortcoming is discordant with National Medicines Policy. Utilisation of biologicals over the first two years of PBS-subsidy was conservative but with considerable variability across States and Territories (an 8-fold difference between the jurisdictions), usage roughly correlating with access to rheumatologists. Introduction of PBS-subsidised biologicals did not alter the trends in utilisation of non-biological anti-rheumatic drugs. Conclusions: This research suggests that policy-makers focus upon: explicitly considering ethical principles and formally involving stakeholders when developing policies on access to high-cost medicines; improving communication and providing information based on increased transparency; and establishing formal mechanisms for review of and appeals against PBS decisions. The comprehensive evaluation of medicine use and outcomes post-subsidy is critical for the future of the PBS. The National Medicines Policy has proved a useful framework for evaluating this access scheme.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Drugs -- Costs -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collector current density and dust collection in wire-plate electrostatic precipitators</field><field name="creator">Yuen, Albert Wai Ling, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Even minimal improvements in particle collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators significantly reduce dust emission from fossil-fuelled power stations and reduce pollution. Yet current designs rely on the Deutsch collection theory, which was developed for tubular precipitators and has been applied to wire-plate precipitators on the assumption that the inter-electrode electric fields at the same discharge distance in both were similar. Differences in geometry and associated collector electric fields and current density non-uniformity have not been taken into account, although the collector electric field and current density of the wire-plate precipitator are not uniform. And observations show that precipitated dust patterns and the distribution of collector current density are interrelated. Investigations revealed a simple square law relationship between the collector electric field and the collector current density in the space charge dominated coronas. Applying this relationship to the Deutsch collection theory led to a current-density-based collection formula that takes into account the non-uniform collector current density distribution.  The current-density-based collection formula is then used to assess the impact of collector current density on collection efficiency, the results closely following published measurements. Applying the current-density-based collection formula to estimate the dust accumulation shows that most of the dust accumulates at collector locations facing the corona wires. The effect of the non-uniform precipitated dust layer on collection performance is assessed using the distributed corona impedance - the ratio of the inter-electrode voltage and the non-uniform collector current. Re-distribution of the collector current profile as dust builds up is also compatible with published measurements. Finally this is applied to optimize the wire-plate precipitator collection performance. This shows that optimal collection performance is obtained with the wire-wire spacing less than the wire-plate distance, once again confirming published experimental results.  This is the first analytical approach to show better collection performance can be achieved at the ratio of wire-wire spacing/wire-plate distance not equal to unity, which has been the standard industry practice since 1960.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Precipitated dust layer</field><field name="subject">Precipitators</field><field name="subject">Electrostatic precipitation</field><field name="subject">Electric power-plants -- Dust control</field><field name="subject">Corona (Electricity)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Term structure modelling and the dynamics of Australian interest rates</field><field name="creator">O???Brien, Peter, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two related parts. In the first part we conduct an empirical examination of the dynamics of Australian interest rates of six different maturities, covering the whole yield curve. This direct study of the long rates is quite novel. We use maximum likelihood estimation on a variety of models and find some results that are in stark contrast to previous studies. We estimate Poisson-jump diffusion (PJD) models and find very strong evidence for the existence of jumps in all daily interest rate series. We find that the PJD model fits short-rate data significantly better than a Bernoulli-jump diffusion model. We also estimate the CKLS model for our data and find that the only model not rejected for all six maturities is the CEV model in stark contrast to previous findings. Also, we find that the elasticity of variance estimate in the CKLS model is much higher for the short-rates than for the longer rates where the estimate is only about 0.25, indicating that different dynamics seem to be at work for different maturities. We also found that adding jumps to the simple diffusion model gives a larger improvement than comes from going from the simple diffusion to the CKLS model. In the second part of the thesis we examine the Flesaker and Hughston (FH) term structure model. We derive the dynamics of the short rate under both the original measure and the risk-neutral measure, and show that some criticisms of the bounds for the short rate may not be significant in actual applications. We also derive the dynamics of bond prices in the FH model and compare them to the HJM model. We also extend the FH model by allowing the martingale to follow a jump-diffusion process, rather than just a diffusion process. We derive the unique change of measure that guarantees the family of bond prices is arbitrage-free. We derive prices for caps and swaptions, and extend the results to include Bermudan swaptions and show how to price options with the jump-diffusion version of the FH model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interest rate models -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Interest rates -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Actin and its regulating proteins in drug response</field><field name="creator">Po???uha, Sela Tu???ipulotu, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Antimicrotubule drugs are used in the treatment of childhood neuroblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Resistance to these agents can be a major clinical problem and mechanisms mediating resistance are not fully understood. Previous studies have reported an association between the actin cytoskeleton and resistance to antimicrotubule drugs. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of the actin regulating proteins, LIM kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2) in drug resistance. In addition, the role of ?? actin, a major actin isoform, in drug resistance was also examined. Chapter 1 reviewed the known mechanisms of antimicrotubule drug resistance and the interaction between the microtubules and actin cytoskeleton. The methodologies used in this study are described in chapter 2. LIMKs are known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton via phosphorylation of cofilin. Real Time RT PCR and western blotting was used in chapter 3 and showed that expression of LIMKs and their downstream target cofilin was altered in antimicrotubule resistant neuroblastoma and leukaemia cells. Moreover, altered LIMK expression was detected in in vivo derived vincristine resistant ALL xenografts and ALL clinical samples, further demonstrating that alterations in LIMKs and cofilin are associated with antimicrotubule drug resistance. Importantly, in chapter 4, gene silencing and drug treated clonogenic assays were performed to elucidate the functional role of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in drug response. Silencing of LIMK1 and/or LIMK2 increased sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to microtubule targeting drugs and DNA damaging agents, suggesting that LIMKs may be useful targets to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs. ??-Actin has been associated with drug resistance and chapter 5 used gene silencing and drug treated clonogenic assays to show that decreased ?? actin expression conferred resistance to anitmicrotubule drugs but not to DNA damaging agents. Microscopy and tubulin polymerisation assays showed that reduced ??-actin protects microtubules from paclitaxel induced polymerisation. This data supports a functional role for ?? actin in antimicrotubule drug action. In conclusion, this study showed that LIMKs and ?? actin mediate the action of antimicrotubule drugs and other anticancer agents, demonstrating that the actin cytoskeleton may serve as a useful drug target to improve the efficacy of anticancer drugs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance in cancer cells</field><field name="subject">Actin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient computation of advanced skyline queries.</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Yidong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline has been proposed as an important operator for many applications, such as multi-criteria decision making, data mining and visualization, and user-preference queries.  Due to its importance, skyline and its computation have received considerable attention from database research community recently. All the existing techniques, however, focus on the conventional databases. They are not applicable to online computation environment, such as data stream. In addition, the existing studies consider efficiency of skyline computation only, while the fundamental problem on the semantics of skylines still remains open. In this thesis, we study three problems of skyline computation: (1) online computing skyline over data stream; (2) skyline cube computation and its analysis; and (3) top-k most representative skyline. To tackle the problem of online skyline computation, we develop a novel framework which converts more expensive multiple dimensional skyline computation to stabbing queries in 1-dimensional space.  Based on this framework, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the time complexity of online skyline computation is provided. Then, efficient algorithms are proposed to support ad hoc and continuous skyline queries over data stream. Inspired by the idea of data cube, we propose a novel concept of skyline cube which consists of skylines of all possible non-empty subsets of a given full space.  We identify the unique sharing strategies for skyline cube computation and develop two efficient algorithms which compute skyline cube in a bottom-up and top-down manner, respectively.  Finally, a theoretical framework to answer the question about semantics of skyline and analysis of multidimensional subspace skyline are presented. Motived by the fact that the full skyline may be less informative because it generally consists of a large number of skyline points, we proposed a novel skyline operator -- top-k most representative skyline. The top-k most representative skyline operator selects the k skyline points so that the number of data points, which are dominated by at least one of these k skyline points, is maximized.  To compute top-k most representative skyline, two efficient algorithms and their theoretical analysis are presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Database design.</field><field name="subject">Question-answering systems.</field><field name="subject">Natural language processing (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Semantics - Data processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brownian motion and heat kernels on compact lie groups and symmetric spaces.</field><field name="creator">Maher, David Graham, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">An important object of study in harmonic analysis is the heat equation.

The most commonly used device is the osmotic tablet, which is essentially a tablet core that is coated with a rate-limiting semipermeable membrane. The feasibility of applying a coating onto a tablet using dense gas techniques was studied. Two different coating materials, polymethymethacrylate (PMMA, Mw = 120,000 g/mol) and cellulose acetate (CA, 39.8 wt% acetyl content) were applied onto an 8 mm osmotic tablet core using the Gas Anti-solvent (GAS) process.  For PMMA, the pressurisation rate, coating temperature and volumetric expansion of up to 250% had minimal effect on the coating quality. The concentration, solvent type and the use of polyethylene glycol (Mw = 200 g/mol) had a more pronounced effect on the coating. The coating process was optimised to apply a smooth and uniform coating with a 50 ??m thickness. For CA, the pressurisation rate and the coating temperature had little effect on the coating that was applied. The process was more sensitive to a change in the concentration of the solution and the volumetric expansion that was used. It was found that the concentration could not be increased too much without affecting the coating quality.  A CA coating was applied onto a PMMA-coated tablet using the optimised conditions. The thickness in the tablet coating increased by 10 ??m. Dissolution tests of the uncoated and coated tablets were carried out. The CA coatings were found to be insufficient in limiting the rate of water entering the tablet and performed similarly to an uncoated tablet core. The PMMA coatings were found to limit the rate of delivery of the model drug. However, variations in the PMMA coatings resulted in an inconsistent delivery profile across batches. The tablets coated with both PMMA and CA had a delivery rate in between that of uncoated and PMMA-coated tablets, indicating that the application of the second coating had compromised the initial PMMA coating.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tablets (Medicine) -- Technological innovations.</field><field name="subject">Coatings.</field><field name="subject">Coating processes.</field><field name="subject">Solubility.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental and theoretical investigation of knee kinematics: a theoretical application to joint reconstruction techniques</field><field name="creator">Dabirrahmani, Dan??, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Passive knee motion is guided by the interaction of the articular surfaces and the restraining role of the soft-tissue structures. It is defined by characteristic kinematics within an envelope of motion. The main goal of this thesis was to simulate this characteristic motion by developing a subject-specific anatomically based finite element model. CT and MR image stacks were used to develop the geometry model and experimental (mechanical) test data was used as model input. Passive knee flexion was simulated and translational and rotational motion described using the Joint Coordinate System (JCS). The model was validated using clinical flexion and AP drawer tests.  An ACL reconstruction model was also developed. Highest AP laxity was found at 30?? of flexion when the graft was positioned in the original native ACL insertion point. ACL tunnel positions were simulated according to surgical techniques. For this case, the highest AP laxity was displayed at 0?? of flexion. Four different graft materials were examined, with the quadriceps tendon graft exhibiting highest laxity, followed by the patellar tendon, braided hamstring and finally unbraided hamstring graft. The effect of malpositioning the graft's femoral attachment point from its central location was also investigated. The proximal femoral attachment point most closely mimicked the central attachment point in terms of AP laxity in the native ACL insertion group. In the ACL tunnel group, the posterior femoral attachment point most closely mimicked the intact knee.  In this thesis it was found that changing the femoral insertion point of the graft can highly influence the AP laxity behaviour. Also using the surgical technique to create ACL tunnels may not necessarily produce the same kinematic behaviour as the intact knee.  Lastly, this thesis has shown the importance of explicitly defining the local reference coordinate system when describing knee kinematics. Changing the coordinate system markedly alters the calculated kinematics.

The presence of DEG in bioprocessing systems for the production of short chain length (scl-) and medium chain length (mcl-) PHAs consequently lowered cell viability and PHA yield. Cell morphology was slightly changed, but the PHA inclusion bodies apparently were not. DEG affected the composition of the mclPHA which was confirmed to be polyhydroxyoctanoate (PHO) with a significant increase in the C8 component. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to quantitatively monitor DEG in the system and revealed its cellular adsorption. Intracellularly, the DEG significantly decreased the molar weight of the mclPHA and sclPHA. P1PH NMR, 2-D COSY and HSQC spectra confirmed that the polymer samples consisted of PHA chains terminated by DEG. Similar to the cultivation of P. oleovorans with DEG, the presence of PEG200 and PEG400 also had an effect on cell growth, PHO yield and cell viability. Furthermore, a hybrid copolymer of PHO-PEG200 was synthesised. The synthesis of these natural-synthetic hybrid copolymers could lead the way for a wide variety of PHA-PEG copolymers with a range of bioactive properties. All thermal properties of PHB were higher than those of PHB-DEG. This may be due to a combination of lower PHB molecular weight and termination of the chains by DEG, i.e. ???DEGylation???. However, PHB-DEG was more elastomeric when compared to PHB, showing properties similar to its copolymer with 20 mol% 3-hydroxyvalerate. Contact angles revealed that the PHB-DEG film was slightly more hydrophilic than PHB. Despite the large difference in their respective proportions, the comparatively small DEG component exerted an influence on chain confirmation, such that solvent casting under humid conditions apparently induced self-assembly and formed a disordered microporous film. DEGylation of PHO also had noticeable effects on the physiochemical properties of the biopolymer. A major decrease in molecular weight, together with the termination of hydrophobic PHO chains with hydrophilic end-groups resulted in changes to its thermal properties when compared to PHO. In comparison to PHO, solvent cast films of PHO-DEG were apparently less flexible, but more hydrophilic.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Copolymers -- Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissecting the requirement for Cited2 during heart development and left-right patterning of the mouse embryo.</field><field name="creator">Lopes Floro, Kylie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cited2 is a member of the Cited gene family, which has no homology to any other genes. It encodes a transcriptional co-factor that is expressed during early heart formation (cardiogenesis). Embryos lacking Cited2 display a range of cardiac defects including bilaterally identical atria, aortic arch abnormalities, rotation of the aorta and pulmonary artery, and malseptation of the cardiac chambers. The latter results in communication between the aorta and pulmonary artery, the aorta and both ventricles, and the atria and ventricles (with themselves and each other). Cardiogenesis is complex, and requires many different cell types and processes to occur correctly. Some of these cells and processes are external to the primary heart. For example, once the initial muscle cells of the heart form a tube, cells from other regions such as the secondary heart field (adjacent mesoderm) and cardiac neural crest (ectoderm) migrate into this tube, and are required for the formation of additional muscle cells and septa. Furthermore, cardiogenesis also requires correct left-right patterning of the embryo to be established prior to heart formation. To understand the developmental origins of the cardiac defects observed in Cited2-null embryos, the expression pattern of Cited2 and the anatomy of Cited2-null embryo hearts were studied. Subsequently, the expression of genes required for left-right patterning were studied in both Cited2-null and Cited2 conditionally-deleted embryos. This demonstrated that Cited2 may be required in many, possibly all, of the processes required for cardiogenesis. Next this study focused on the role of Cited2 in patterning the left-right axis of the embryo. Firstly, Cited2 was found to regulate the expression of the master regulator of left-right patterning (Nodal). Secondly, Cited2 was shown to regulate the expression of the left-specific transcription factor Pitx2 independently of Nodal. Thirdly, gene expression and conditional deletions of Cited2 suggested that Cited2 might regulate left-right patterning in the paraxial mesoderm, a tissue which has not previously been shown to regulate the left-right axis in the mouse. Lastly, an argument is made suggesting the possibility that all the cardiac defects found in Cited2-null embryos may directly or indirectly stem from a failure of correct left-right patterning.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Differentiation.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Mice -- Embryology.</field><field name="subject">Embryology -- Experimental.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the behaviour of reactive powder concrete columns</field><field name="creator">Malik, Adnan Rauf, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis was carried out in two phases to investigate the behaviour of reactive powder concrete (RPC) columns.  In the first phase of this study, six steel fibre reinforced RPC columns of 150 mm square cross section were tested to failure under various loading eccentricities. The RPC mix contained 2 percent (by volume) of straight steel fibres with a concrete strength of about 150 MPa. The columns contained either 4 or 7 percent of longitudinal reinforcement but no tie reinforcement in the test region. All the columns failed in a controlled manner and no buckling of the longitudinal steel or cover spalling was observed, even well beyond the peak load. The tests revealed that stirrups can be significantly reduced for steel fibre reinforced RPC columns, which could lead to an increase in the speed of construction with an associated potential reduction in construction costs.  In the second phase, 17 RPC columns were tested with 16 confined using carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). The concrete mix contained either no fibres or 2 percent (by volume) of straight steel fibres with concrete strength of approximately 160 MPa. The columns contained no conventional steel reinforcement. For the concentrically loaded specimens, failure occurred at or close to the peak loading and the CFRP increased the strength by 19 percent compared with the unconfined specimen. The tests showed that the formulae developed to predict the peak strength of concentrically loaded FRP confined conventional strength concrete columns, in general, overestimate the load carrying capacity of FRP confined RPC specimens. The CFRP was shown to be effective in controlling the failure for the eccentrically loaded specimens. There was no evidence, however, that the use of CFRP in the hoop direction significantly increased the strength of the columns.  Three dimensional nonlinear FE analyses of the test specimens were undertaken using the program DIANA. The FE analyses showed a reasonable comparison with the experimental results for the specimens tested under eccentric loading.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concrete construction -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Reinforced concrete.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ambivalent ground: re-placing Australian literature</field><field name="creator">Paull, James, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Narratives of place have always been crucial to the construction of Australian identity. The obsession with identity in Australia betrays longstanding uncertainty. It is not difficult to interpret in this uncertainty a replaying of the deeper insecurities surrounding the settler community's legal and more broadly cultural claims to the land. Such insecurities are typically understood negatively. In contrast, this thesis accepts the uncertainty of identity as an activating principle, appropriate to any interpretation of the narratives and themes that inform what it means to be Australian. Fundamental to this uncertainty is a provisionality in the post-colonial experience of place that is papered over by misleadingly coherent spatial narratives that stem from the imperial inheritance of Australian mythology. Place is a model for the tension between the coherence of mythic narratives and the actual rhizomic formlessness of daily life. Place is the ???ground??? of that life, but an ambivalent ground. An Ambivalent Ground approaches postcolonial Australia as a densely woven text. In this text, stories that describe the founding of a nation are enveloped by other stories, not so well known, that work to transform those more familiar narratives. ???Re-placing Australian literature??? describes the process of this transformation. It signifies an interpretative practice which seeks to recuperate the open-ended experience of place that remains disguised by the coherent narratives of nationhood. The process of ???re-placing??? Australian literature shifts the understanding of nation towards a landscape that speaks not so much about identity as about the constitutive performances of everyday life. It also converges with the unhomely dimension that is the colonist's ambiguous sense of belonging. We can understand this process with an analogy used in this thesis, that of music ??? the colonising language, and noise ??? the ostensibly inchoate, unformed background disruptive to cultural order yet revealing the spatial realities of place. Traditionally, cultural narratives in Australia have disguised the much more complex way in which place noisily disrupts and diffracts those narratives, and in the process generates the ambivalence of Australian identity. Rather than a text or a narrative, place is a plenitude, a densely intertwined performance space, a performance that constantly renders experience ??? and its cultural function ??? transgressive. The purpose of this thesis is not to displace stereotypical narratives of nationhood with yet another narrative. Rather, it offers the more risky proposition that provisionality and uncertainty are constitutive features of Australian social being. The narrative in the thesis represents an aggregation of such an ambivalent ground, addressing the persistent tension between place and the larger drama of colonialist history and discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian literature -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Landscape in literature.</field><field name="subject">Cultural history and literary imagination.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ideology of nation and race: the Croatian Ustasha regime and its policies toward minorities in the independent state of Croatia, 1941-1945.</field><field name="creator">Bartulin, Nevenko, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the central place of racial theories in the nationalist ideology of the Croatian Ustasha movement and regime, and how these theories functioned as the chief motive in shaping Ustasha policies toward the minorities of the Nazi-backed Independent State of Croatia (known by its Croatian initials as the NDH), namely, Serbs, Jews, Roma and Bosnian Muslims, during the years 1941 to 1945. This thesis is divided into three parts. The first part deals with historical background, concentrating on the history of Croatian national movements from the 1830s to the 1930s. The second part covers the period between the founding of the Ustasha movement in 1930 and the creation of the NDH in 1941. The third part examines the period of Ustasha power from 1941 to 1945. Through the above chronological division, this thesis traces the evolution of Ustasha ideas on nation and race, placing them within the historical context of processes of Croatian national integration. Although the Ustashe were brought to power by Nazi Germany, their ideology emerged less as an imitation of German National Socialism and more as an extremist reaction to the supranational and expansionist nationalist ideologies of Yugoslavism and Greater Serbianism. In contrast to the prevailing historiographical view that has either ignored or downplayed the significance of racial theori! es on Ustasha policies toward the minorities of the NDH, this thesis highlights the marked influence of the question of 'race' on Ustasha attitudes toward the 'problem' of minorities, and on the wider question of Croatian national identity. This thesis examines the Ustashe by focusing on the historical interplay between nationalism and racism, which dominated so much of the modern political life of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. The fusion of nationalism and racism was not unique to Ustasha ideology, but the evolution and nature of Ustasha racism was. Ustasha racial ideas were therefore the product of both specific Croatian and wider European historical trends. This examination of the historical intersection between nationalism and racism in the case of the Ustashe will, i hope, broaden our understanding of twentieth-century nation-state formation, and state treatment of minorities, in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Europe, Central -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity -- Europe, Central -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Ideology -- Croatia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Minorities -- Government policy -- Croatia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making things to think with.</field><field name="creator">White, Karen Sue, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Distributed cognition has been emerging as a new research direction in cognitive science over the last two decades and is gaining momentum.

The framework is called `RD' which is short for `Reasoning about Designs'. RD integrates proof, development and diagnostic modes of reasoning. Many commonly studied formalisms are shown to be consistent with this framework. A large example based on an industrial problem is given to demonstrate RD. The integration of system design and management is achieved by unifying formal software engineering methods and model-based reasoning. RD formally specifies a complete toolkit for performing system development and then re-using the development as the system description for diagnostic reasoning. RD does not restrict the contributing system analysis methods, rather it maps out and defines the entities and relations common to both. The framework is, in principle, extensible to support other forms of reasoning. The ground technical mechanism of the framework is a novel view of formal system development based on a general implementation relation. Implementation relations are widely studied in formal methods in software engineering where they are often referred to as `refinement'. RD allows refinement relations to be defined in a way that makes expected behaviours and faults of system implementations explicit. Furthermore, a case is made that all well known forms of refinement implicitly support diagnostic reasoning as they can be restated within the framework. RD is an integrated and completely rigorous approach to the core system building tasks of design and management. Despite the large amount of technical detail, the following discussion can be seen as raising many issues that relate to engineering in general. In particular, a formal engineering process should have benefits beyond just the delivery of systems that satisfy their specifications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer systems -- Development</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The internationalisation of financial services firms</field><field name="creator">Young, Owen, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most financial institutions have not been successful at internationalisation, with some being remarkably unsuccessful. There are fewer occurrences of cross-border mergers and acquisitions than in most other industries. Foreign financial institutions tend to underperform relative to domestic financial institutions. Rugman and others have argued that their internationalisation primarily occurs at the regional rather than global level.  Existing theories identify some barriers to firms? internationalisation, but these theories, were developed for manufacturing firms, and were rarely applied to financial services firms. This research seeks to identify barriers to financial institutions' internationalisation  and contribute to the under-researched area of services internationalisation. To better understand the barriers to internationalisation, qualitative research techniques were used for an in-depth case-study analysis of one firm and its attempts at internationalisation, followed by detailed interviews of internationally experienced financial institutions executives from other firms. Finally, the apparent preference for regional over global expansion was investigated, through a quantitative analysis of over 12,000 cross-border, financial-services merger and acquisition transactions from 1990 to mid-2005.  The research identified thirty-eight barriers to internationalisation, consistent with Rugman's findings on regional expansion, but also with the effects of similarity variables such as language, culture and legal system. The quantitative analysis tested these effects and found that the region effect was high, and was stronger than language and cultural effects individually, but about the same as their combined effect. The legal system similarity is not statistically significant when all effects are combined.  This research contributes to this under-researched field. Given that internationalisation supports economic growth in the host and home countries, an improved understanding of these barriers may assist policy makers and enable managers to make better international investment decisions. The findings on the effect of geography versus other factors, such as language and culture, may inform managers' choice of target countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalization - Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Financial institutions.</field><field name="subject">Financial services industry.</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises.</field><field name="subject">International finance.</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Banking Corporation (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photochemical and biological production of superoxide: Effect on redox cycling and bioavailability of iron.</field><field name="creator">Garg, Shikha, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Superoxide, a reduced form of dioxygen is produced in natural waters from abiotic thermal processes such as iron(II) oxygenation photochemically, and biologically in natural waters. Superoxide is highly redox-active due to the presence of an unpaired electron and plays an important role in the geochemical cycling of trace metals and degradation of organic pollutants in natural waters. It also has a significant effect on the physiology of aquatic microorganisms and has been implicated in the growth of toxic microalga in coastal areas of Japan, Australia and Canada.  The generation of superoxide by both biotic and photochemical pathways is described in this thesis and attention given to selected reactions of superoxide in simulated natural waters. Particular attention in this work has been given to the interaction of superoxide and iron and the impact of this interaction on iron availability to Chattonella marina, a red-tide phytoplankton frequently associated with fish-mortalities in Australia and Japan. Superoxide production from both phototchemical and biological sources is measured using a highly sensitive chemiluminescence technique and the effect of superoxide production on iron transformation under various environmental conditions is investigated by employing spectrophotometric techniques with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. The intermediacy of superoxide in iron acquisition mechanism by C. marina is also investigated using a radioisotope labeling technique. Our experimental results show that superoxide in natural waters is produced via reduction of dioxygen. The reduction of dioxygen takes place by transfer of electrons by the photo-excited quinone moieties present in natural organic matter or by reductases located on the outer cell membrane of organisms' surface. The experimental results suggest that the fate of iron in marine waters is closely related to the superoxidedioxygen redox couple. Superoxide can reduce a wide range of organically complexed iron(III) species to the more soluble iron(II) redox state, thus affecting its bioavailability. A simple kinetic model for redox-cycling of iron in the presence of superoxide is developed. In addition, by coupling the model for redox-cycling of iron with the forms of iron acquired by C. marina, a generalized mathematical model for iron acquisition is presented which satisfactorily describes all results obtained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superoxide.</field><field name="subject">Iron.</field><field name="subject">Water chemistry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing understorey structural characteristics in eucalypt forests: an investigation of LiDAR techniques.</field><field name="creator">Goodwin, Nicholas R., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The potential of airborne LiDAR technology to quantify forest structure within eucalypt forests has been evaluated with a focus on the understorey stratum. To achieve this, three studies have been undertaken using multiple (4) LiDAR datasets acquired over three test areas located in Wedding Bells State Forest, Coffs Harbour, Australia. Initially, the effects of sensor configuration were evaluated using field measurements collected from three structurally and topographically differing field plots (40 x 90 m areas). Results indicated that canopy height profiles derived from LiDAR data at the plot scale were largely unaffected by a change in platform altitude from 1000 to 3000 m (p &amp;gt 0.05). In addition, the derivation of individual tree attributes was found to be highly sensitive to the density of LiDAR observations whilst higher platform altitudes showed an increased proportion of single returns over forested areas. In the second study, an innovative field based approach was developed to sample the structure of the understorey (horizontally and vertically) for LiDAR validation purposes. Using two separate LiDAR datasets, this research confirmed that mean understorey height and understorey cover can be effectively mapped in areas of low to medium canopy cover whilst no significant relationship (p &amp;gt 0.05) was identified between field and LiDAR estimates of maximum understorey height. In the third study, an optimised LiDAR beam interception model was developed and validated, and then applied to assess the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic factors of the LiDAR survey. This demonstrated that the probability of beam interception through the forest canopy can be affected by factors both intrinsic (e.g. crown cover) and extrinsic (e.g. scan angle) to the structure of the canopy. Overall, the results of this research indicate that optimising the sensor configuration is important to the derivation of particular forest structural attributes and significantly, there is potential for LiDAR technology to provide quantitative and spatially detailed estimates of key understorey attributes such as mean height and cover.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eucalyptus</field><field name="subject">Forest ecology</field><field name="subject">Forest plants</field><field name="subject">Forest surveys</field><field name="subject">Understory plants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and numerical investigation of noise generation from the expansion of high velocity HVAC flows on board ocean going fast ferries</field><field name="creator">Neale, James Richard, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis details a study of strategies used to limit the flow generated noise encountered in the outlet diffusers of high velocity heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) duct systems. The underlying noise rating criterion is drawn from the specifications covering ocean going aluminium fast ferries. Although directed primarily towards the fast ferry industry the results presented herein are applicable to other niche high velocity HVAC applications. Experimental tests have been conducted to prove the viability of a high velocity HVAC duct system in meeting airflow requirements whilst maintaining acceptable passenger cabin noise levels. A 50 mm diameter circular jet of air was expanded using a primary conical diffuser with a variety of secondary outlet configurations. Noise measurements were taken across a velocity range of 15 to 60 m/s. An optimum outlet design has been experimentally identified by varying the diffuser angle, outlet duct length and the termination grill. A 4 to 5 fold reduction in required duct area was achieved with the use of a distribution velocity of 20 to 30 ms-1, without exceeding the prescribed passenger cabin noise criteria. The geometric configuration of the diffuser outlet assembly was found to have a pronounced effect on the noise spectrum radiating from the duct outlet. The development of a numerical model capable of predicting the flow induced noise generated by airflow exiting a ventilation duct is also documented. The model employs a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD model to calculate the turbulent flow field through the duct diffuser section and outlet. The flow-generated noise is then calculated using a far field acoustic postprocessor based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral based formulation of Lighthill???s acoustic analogy. Time varying flow field variables are used to calculate the fluctuating noise sources located at the duct outlet and the resulting far field sound pressure levels. This result is then used to  calculate the corresponding far field sound intensity and sound power levels. The numerical acoustic model has been verified and validated against the measured experimental results for multiple outlet diffuser configurations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Air conditioning -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Air conditioning -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Ventilation -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Ventilation -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Heating -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Heating -- Noise</field><field name="subject">Shipping</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeking new understanding and applications of 1,1' -Bisisoquinolines</field><field name="creator">Chan, Benjamin Kin Heng, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has two parts. The first deals with the conformational behaviour of Nsubstituted and N-unsubstituted bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives under neutral and acidic conditions and the second describes the design, synthesis and structural characterization of a new class of N-ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, potential catch and release agents. Four N-alkyl derivatives, two of which were new, were studied in detail for their conformational behaviour and their spectroscopic properties compared extensively with N-unsubstituted compounds. NMR chemical shift changes and vicinal spin couplings were measured and related to conformational change within the heterocyclic rings and about the central C1-C1' axis. The basicity of the amines were determined through pKa measurements, and differences between the behaviour of secondary and tertiary amine examples discussed. Analysis of titration results revealed the formation of discrete 1:1 and 1:2 complexes between the secondary examples and added carboxylic acids, but only 1:1 complexes in the case of tertiary amine complexes. Monitoring of changes in conformation with incremental addition of acid provided new understanding about modes of binding.  A new class of nine ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives has been prepared. These contain N'-aryl and N'-adamantyl urea groups attached to the bisisoquinoline core through alkyl linker groups with varying length. The conformation of these derivatives were heavily dependent upon the linker length while the nature of the urea group (in one case a thiourea) played a small role in the preferred conformation of the bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline. Three non-isoquinoline derived model ureidyl amine systems were also synthesized for comparative studies. Four partner ureidyl acids were prepared and their pKa values in DMSO were measured. Studies of the interaction of the ureidyl acids with the ureidyl amines revealed that the chain length of the ureidyl bistetrahydroisoquinoline linker played a small role while the remote aryl and adamantyl groups of both acids and amines played a more important role. DMSO was found to interfere with the normal conformations of the ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinolines and with the interaction of the ureidyl bis-tetrahydroisoquinolines with their partner ureidyl acids in deuterochloroform. The latter studies will provide the basis for future design of catch-and-release agents derived from bis-tetrahydroisoquinolines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isoquinoline.</field><field name="subject">Tetrahydroisoquinolines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Porous hybrid organic-inorganic silica materials: preparation, structural and transport properties</field><field name="creator">Haryadi, Haryadi, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to prepare a series of silica materials based on sol-gel processing of alkoxysilanes using glucose and glycerol as templates for potential applications in membrane design for pervaporation. The materials were characterized using structural and dynamic techniques to gain information about the effect of the templates on the formation of micro- and mesoporous silicates. The interaction between templates and silica matrices were investigated using FTIR, Raman Spectroscopy, Solid State NMR Spectroscopy, Physisorption and SEM. Close contact between templates and silica networks was observed by NMR cross polarization studies. The chemistry was then extended to prepare hybrid organic-inorganic silica materials by introducing organic ligands, with glycerol as a template to control the porosity of the hybrid materials. By varying the ligand as well as the template, the physical properties of the gel can be controlled. Composites of hydroxypropylcellulose, HPC, and silica were also prepared and characterized. There was no phase separation during sol-gel processing suggesting HPC was dispersed homogenously in the silica matrices. This was also confirmed by solid state NMR. Temperature dependence showed some indications of conformational change in the HPC within the silicate, above 308K. The transport properties of the hybrid materials were observed by monitoring the diffusion behaviour of water and several selected solvents using Pulsed Field Gradient NMR. The self-diffusion of water and the organic solvents in the hybrid silica materials were two to three orders of magnitude smaller than in the liquid bulk suggesting restricted diffusion at the pore surface. The effect of surface polarity also contributed to water and solvents diffusivities. The temperature dependence of diffusion was useful to derive the activation energy whereas the dependence on NMR observation time provided information on both tortuosity and pore connectivity of the hybrid silica materials. The hybrid silica membranes were prepared by spin coating of polymeric silica sol on top of a macroporous alumina support after being occluded by colloidal silica. It was then used for pervaporation of water ethanol mixtures. The results implied that separation factor increased as the temperature increased.

The interaction between these elements, especially in a spatial sense, creates both a visual and conceptual ambiguity central to the meaning of the work. Multiple treatments of painted form -- realist, expressive and abstract are interleaved producing divergent visual sensations.  The transition from one visual sensation to another, the way the eye traverses believable forms to suddenly collide with the canvas, forced there by raw, painted gesture, is an unpredictable journey invoking visual perplexity, thereby alerting the viewer to potential meanings; the research paintings are not just images of things, they are images of things that would not normally exist together, but do so to create a story. It is intended that the viewer be directed toward the subject of the painting as much as the qualities of the medium itself.  Influences as diverse as art historical painting, photography, the motion and lighting effects of film, the qualities of surface reflections and chiaroscuro, have been sourced to facilitate a new body of work. Directing the relationship of the viewer to the paintings through format and scale, (generally life size or very small) promotes a similar kind of interaction (the need to get up close and far away) to that of the application of pictorial space. This is an important aspect of the research; the optical process of focussing in and out is a microcosm of looking at the paintings installed in physical space.  The subject of the paintings is female sexuality and its connection to identity, relationships and self-expression. It is also the conceptual object of 'Multiplicity', a principal idea in the work, ambiguous pictorial situations suggesting reality is not one thing but a combination of remembered, existing and subconscious experience. In the research, this concept also pertains to the painter (using memory, experience and imagination) and the audience viewing the work at different times.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space in art.</field><field name="subject">Realism in art.</field><field name="subject">Abstraction in art.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viral infection and propagation in plant tissue culture</field><field name="creator">Shadwick, Fiona Stella, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The propagation of wild-type virus and a transgenic viral vector was examined in cultured plant cells to identify factors affecting viral infection of and accumulation in cultured cells and to determine if viral vectors could be used to facilitate the expression of heterologous proteins in vitro.   Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) accumulation was examined in Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana suspension and hairy root cultures.  TMV accumulation was superior in N. benthamiana hairy roots.  Hairy roots were infected by adding TMV to the liquid culture medium at the same time as root inoculation.  Hairy root growth was unaffected by virus infection.  The distribution of virus within root mats from shake-flask grown cultures was non-uniform and the concentration of virus accumulated in replicate cultures was variable.  When N. benthamiana hairy roots were infected using 1.5 &#956;g mL-1 TMV, the average maximum concentration of virus accumulated in the biomass was 1.6  ?? 0.25 mg g-1 dry weight, or 15-fold lower than in TMV infected N. tabacum leaves.  Virus coat protein accumulated to a level of (26 ?? 10)% total soluble protein in the hairy roots.  Inoculum virus concentration and the medium in which infection was performed affected the virus yield and the percentage of inoculated cultures that accumulated virus.  When cultures were inoculated using 9.0 &#956;g mL-1 TMV, virus accumulated in the biomass to 4.2 ?? 0.60 mg g-1 dry weight.  Proportional scale-up of hairy root infection in shake flasks did not result in constant virus concentrations in the scaled cultures.  TMV accumulation in bioreactor-infected and -grown hairy roots was poor. N. benthamiana hairy roots were infected with a TMV-based vector (30B-GFPC3) that encoded Cycle 3 green fluorescent protein (GFP).  TMV-GFPC3 was (260 ?? 140)-fold less infectious than TMV as measured by local lesion assays.  Propagation of TMV-GFPC3 could not be confirmed using mass balance.  GFP was not detected in the infected hairy roots or the culture medium.  Hairy roots represent a potentially viable culture-based system for the in vitro production of virus and virus products when field-grown agricultural systems do not adequately address issues of containment or product safety.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant micropropagation.</field><field name="subject">Plant tissue culture.</field><field name="subject">Plant biotechnology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metonymy and trauma: re-presenting death in the literature of W. G. Sebald</field><field name="creator">Watts, Andrew Michael, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Novel: Fragments of a Former Moon The novel Fragments of a Former Moon (FFM) invokes the paradoxical earlier death of the still-living protagonist. The unmarried German woman is told that her skeletal remains have been discovered in Israel, thirty-eight years since her body was interred in 1967. This absurd premise raises issues of representing death in contemporary culture; death's destabilising effect on the individual's textual representation; post-Enlightenment dissolution of the modern rational self; and problems of mimetic post- Holocaust representation. Using W G Sebald's fiction as a point of departure, FFM's photographic illustrations connote modes of textual representation that disrupt the autobiographical self, invoking mortality and its a-temporal (representational) displacement. As with Sebald's recurring references to the Holocaust, FFM depicts a psychologically unstable protagonist seeking to recover repressed memories of an absent past. Research dissertation: Metonymy &amp;Trauma: Re-presenting Death in the Literature of W. G. Sebald. The dissertation centres on the effect of metonymy in the rhetoric of textually-constructed identity and its contemporary representation in the face of death. I concentrate on the effect of Holocaust trauma on representation and memory, relating trauma theory to the metonymy of W G Sebald's fiction, and situating representations of the traumatised self within the institution of modern bureaucracy. Using Ronald Schleifer's theory of metonymy I explore the rhetorical process by which Sebald seeks to depict the unrepresentable within Holocaust history, arguing that Sebald's correlation of text with image evokes problems of Holocaust discourse because it re-presents the past while recognising inadequacies within conventional narrative. Photography's function as an indexical trace of the past grounds my account of Sebald's use of imagery in questioning conventional forms of representation. I argue that Sebald construes the institutionalised constitution of the modern self through civic architecture, emphasising the metonymical associations of contemporary Western life and death. I maintain ultimately that the ethically displaced modern self typifies a culture capable of committing - and simultaneously repressing the representation - of technologised mass genocide: Sebald's texts critique modern society by apprehending modes of intersubjective memory and narrative responsibility through acknowledgement of the arbitrary, indexical capacity of metonymical representation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sebald, Winfried Georg, 1944- -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Death in literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Providing statistical inference to case-based software effort estimation</field><field name="creator">Keung, Wai, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a novel approach, called Analogy-X to extend and improve the classical data-intensive analogy approach for software effort estimation. The Analogy-X approach combines the notions of distance matrix correlation found in ecology literature and statistic analysis techniques to provide useful inferential statistics to support analogy-based systems.  Data-intensive analogy for software effort estimation has been proposed as a viable alternative to other prediction methods such as linear regression. In many cases, researchers found analogy outperformed algorithmic methods. However, the overall performance of analogy depends on the dataset quality or relevance of project cases to the target project, and the feature subset selected in the analogy-based model. Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to assess its appropriateness for a specific dataset, in most of the cases analogy will continue to execute regardless of the dataset quality.  The Analogy-X approach is a set of procedures that utilize the principles of Mantel randomization test to provide inferential statistics to Analogy. Inspired by the Mantel correlation randomization test commonly used in ecology and psychology, Analogy-X uses the strength of correlation between the distance matrix of project features and the distance matrix of known effort values of the dataset to assess the suitability of the dataset for analogy, to identify the most appropriate feature subset, and to remove any atypical project cases from the dataset.  The empirical studies show that Analogy-X is capable of: -- Detect extremely outlying project cases that will ultimately distort prediction outcomes using a sensitivity analysis strategy. -- Detect relevant project features that are useful to identify potential source analogues in a stepwise fashion similar to that of stepwise regression. -- Identifying whether analogy-based approach is appropriate for the dataset Analogy-X, thus is a robust solution, provides a sound statistical basis for analogy. It removes the need of using any forms of heuristic search and greatly improves its algorithmic performance. The studies also show that the Analogy-X approach is capable of removing the bottlenecks of performance in data-intensive analogy.  The overall results obtained also suggest that a fully automated data-intensive analogy for software effort estimation can be implemented using the Analogy-X approach, and it is indeed an effective front end to analogy-based systems. The contribution of this work is significant since it provides an approach that will have major impact on the evolution of data-intensive analogy-based and case-based reasoning systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software engineering.</field><field name="subject">Software engineering -- Mathematics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of substance flow analysis, transport and fate of materials in the environment, and environmental risk assessment for provision of information for regional environmental management: cadmium as a case study in Australia</field><field name="creator">Kwonpongsagoon, Suphaphat, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Extraction, production, utilization and disposal of material resources have been undertaken continuously for much of human histories. Unavoidably, all of these activities have disturbed our environment, and subsequently have been harmful to humans and ecosystems in this and future generations. Due to time lag associated with both environment impact and the effects of measures taken to reduce this impact, existing approaches (i.e. monitoring and reacting) do not give sufficiently rapid feedback for effective environmental management. With regard to the complexity and concern related to environment-health chain effects, there is currently no environmental tool or approach that can provide comprehensive information and indicators covering all major environment and health themes, to enable decision makers to make informed judgements about regional policies and plans, relating to the sustainable use and disposal of material resources. Consequently, there is a need for developing a new approach by taking account of a multidisciplinary concept used in this thesis.  Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) has been mainly applied in order to provide input information for Health Risk Assessment (HRA). The SFA approach provides the quantity of the substance that is transported (flows) and stored in the system (stock), and of which sub-system, flow, and process is the greatest concern. The HRA approach provides estimates of human health risk associated with site, activity and facility. An environmental fate and transport model is another key knowledge area incorporated into the HRA process.  An integrating method of SFA, environmental fate and transport, and HRA is developed and illustrated by a case study of cadmium in Australia.  This thesis shows that this new integration of existing stand-alone methods can provide holistic information and useful indicators covering all significant economic activities, environment, flows, and health risk assessment for selected substances. This enables better decision making on the use and disposal of substances at a range of levels in the economy, from corporations to regions and nations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental health.</field><field name="subject">Environmental management.</field><field name="subject">Cadmium -- Environmental aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic modelling of Fenton-mediated oxidation: reaction mechanism, applications,and optimization.</field><field name="creator">Duesterberg, Christopher Ku, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ever-increasing detection of harmful organic and inorganic compounds in habitable areas throughout the world has led to mounting research into applications and techniques for the treatment of contaminated soils, surface and groundwaters, and chemical and industrial wastewaters. Chemical oxidation technologies, in particular Fenton-based remediation systems, have exhibited considerable potential for the effective treatment and remediation of such contaminated waters and soils.  The use of Fenton-based oxidation systems for the treatment of contaminated waters and wastewaters warrants the development of kinetic models capable of accurately simulating system behaviour. In this thesis, the kinetics of Fenton-mediated oxidation systems and kinetic models based on its governing reaction mechanism are investigated in order to highlight those parameters and conditions that effect Fenton chemistry and oxidation performance, and to demonstrate the application of such kinetic models to design and improve treatment systems.  Experimental and simulated data describing the oxidation of formic acid by Fenton's reagent at low pH (3 to 4) and under a variety of initial conditions, operating regimes, and solution environments supports a proposed reaction mechanism that nominates the hydroxyl radical (OH) as the active oxidizing intermediate in Fenton-based oxidation systems. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that formic acid oxidation is inhibited in the presence of oxygen, and model simulations of these systems reveals that such behaviour is due to the effect organic radical intermediates and/or by-products have in assisting or hindering the redox cycling of the catalytic iron species. The critical role that iron redox cycling plays in affecting oxidation performance is further highlighted by experimental and simulated studies at alternate pHs and using different target organics, including those that react directly with iron in a redox capacity. Experiments at pH 4 reveal an increase in the redox cycling of iron and improved oxidation performance compared to pH 3 as the higher pH favours the superoxide radical, a stronger reductant than the hydroperoxyl radical that predominates at pH 3. Other laboratory and modelling studies on the Fenton-mediated oxidation of certain aromatic compounds highlight the manner in which quinone and quinone-like compounds, being added directly or generated as oxidation by-products, can improve oxidation performance via redox reactions with iron. Further simulations reveal the type of practical design and operating information kinetic models can provide for treatment processes, though it is noted an appropriate understanding of the oxidation mechanism of the target species is necessary for the accurate application of the model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water -- Purification -- Oxidation.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- Pollution.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Pollution.</field><field name="subject">Environmental chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Soil remediation -- Oxidation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional studies of transcription factors GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 in Megakaryocyte development.</field><field name="creator">Pan, Shu, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transcription factors GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 are essential proteins for normal megakaryopoiesis, however, the detailed analyses of their functions within developmental stages of megakaryopoiesis are lacking. In my thesis, over expression of gene in target cells was adopted as the main strategy to study the biological functions of these proteins, therefore, an efficient gene delivery method was first developed by using retrovirus.This approach was then utilized to over express GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 in murine leukemia M1 cells and mouse hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and their effects on different developmental stages of megakaryopoiesis were investigated. In the transduced M1 cells, enforced expression of GATA-1 and Fli-1 was found to induce the megakaryocytic development, which was associated with the formation of megakaryocyte (Mk) and the increased expression of Mk specific genes c-Mpl and GPIX. In the transduced mouse HSCs, it was found that the expression of endogenous GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 was up-regulated throughout Mk differentiation; enforced expression of these transcription factors led to the significantly enhanced Mk development. Megakaryocytes over expressing GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 were characterized by the increased expression of various Mk-specific genes including GPIX, c-Mpl, platelet factor 4 (PF4), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and NF-E2, an important transcription factor for terminal megakaryopoiesis; however, GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 displayed the different abilities in promoting the proliferation of hematopoietic cells and MK differentiation, as well as regulating other transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis. To further elucidate the role of the functional domains of Fli-1, various mutants of Fli-1 were also over expressed in mouse HSCs. The results demonstrated that first, the combination of the activation domain of Fli-1 and its Ets domain is required for early megakaryopoiesis but not sufficient for terminal megakaryopoiesis; second, DNA binding of Fli-1 was not the only requirement for early Mk enhancement, moreover, the interaction between Fli-1 and GATA-1 through the Ets domain and the resultant transcriptional synergy was the essential determinant for Fli?1 ability in Mk development. Taken together, the studies presented in this thesis provided strong in vitro evidence that GATA-1, Fli-1 and FOG-1 indeed play the critical roles in normal megakaryopoiesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes.</field><field name="subject">Stem cells -- Research -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Proteins -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the role of prolactin in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis.</field><field name="creator">Oakes, Samantha Richelle, St. Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The pituitary hormone prolactin (Prl) is essential for alveolar morphogenesis and plays a role in breast carcinogenesis, however the mechanism that underlies these actions remains to be defined. Alterations in serum Prl provide the primary endocrine signal regulating developmental events in the mammary gland in sexually mature mammals. Prl production and post-translational phosphorylation by the pituitary is regulated by the neuropeptide Galanin (Gal) in response to hypothalamic signals integrating neuronal and endocrine inputs. Prl exerts its effects on the mammary epithelium in two ways, indirectly by modulation of the systemic hormonal environment, for example the release of progesterone from the corpus luteum, and directly by binding to Prl receptors (Prlr) within the mammary epithelium. Prl binding to Prlr initiates signalling predominantly via activation of the Jak2/Stat5 pathway, leading to altered patterns of gene transcription. One of these target genes is the ets transcription factor Elf5, which is required by the epithelium for alveolar morphogenesis. This thesis aims to further our understanding of the mechanisms by which prolactin exerts its influence on the mammary gland during alveolar morphogenesis and carcinogenesis. Transcript profiling revealed a lactation signature of 35 genes in Prlr+/- mice, Gal-/- mice and mice treated with a Prl mutant (S179D) that mimics phosphorylated Prl. We discovered that the majority of changes in gene expression were produced by prolactin rather than by Gal. The action of Gal was predominantly via modulation of Prl phosphorylation and release, as its effects were very similar to that of S179D. Knockout of Elf5 phenocopied knockout of Prlr, resulting in failure of alveolar morphogenesis and reduced expression of milk and lipid synthesis genes. Forced Elf5 expression at puberty resulted in aberrant differentiation of the terminal end buds and milk protein synthesis during ductal morphogenesis. Re-expression of Elf5 in Prlr-/- mammary epithelial cells completely rescued alveolar morphogenesis. These observations indicate that Elf5 is a master regulator of alveolar morphogenesis downstream of the Prlr. Loss of mammary epithelial Prlr resulted in reduced proliferation of low-grade neoplastic lesions resulting in increased tumour latency in the C3(1)/SV40T model of mammary carcinogenesis. There was no change in the growth rate, proliferation nor the morphology of tumours in Prlr-/-/C3(1)/SV40T transplants, thus Prl acts early in carcinogenesis to drive the proliferation of pre-invasive lesions resulting in faster progression to cancer.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prolactin -- Psychological effect</field><field name="subject">Mammary glands</field><field name="subject">Carcinogenesis</field><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer -- Etiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical impedance tomography at low frequencies.</field><field name="creator">Noor, Johan Andoyo Effendi, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most EIT machine operates at high frequencies above 10 kHz. Biological systems demonstrate dispersions of electrical impedance characteristics at very low frequencies below 2 kHz due to the presence of membrane surrounding the cells and diffusion polarisation effects.  A study was made on the feasibility of the use of low frequencies in a range of 1.12 Hz to 4.55 kHz in EIT. One high frequency of 77.712 kHz similar to that normally used in common EIT was also used as a comparison. The impedance measurements employed a four-terminal method using the BULFIS, an ultra low frequency impedance spectrometer and used conducting and insulating material as the objects/phantoms.  The results show that the conductance and capacitance of a metal object disperses at frequency range of 0.1 -10 kHz, which is consistent to the electrical properties of a double layer forming at the metal-electrolyte interface similar to the electrical properties of a membrane.  The reconstructed images reveal that at low frequencies the conducting and the insulating bodies were indistinguishable. They appear differently at high frequencies above 4.55 kHz indicating that the use of multi frequency instrumentation in EIT covering the very low frequency range provides information that instrumentation restricted to frequencies above 10 kHz does not supply. While the internal structure of the double layers could not be delineated, the presence of the double layers could be readily detected by the behaviour of the images as the frequency was varied. This has potential for EIT because it might allow the detection of structures from the variation of the images with frequency. This variation with frequency does not occur at the higher frequencies more usually used for EIT.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tomography.</field><field name="subject">Medical imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of thermophiles for ethanol production.</field><field name="creator">Riyanti, Eny Ida, School of Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Potential thermophiles for ethanol production at elevated temperature were compared based on their kinetic performances. T. thermophilus HB27 demonstrated superior kinetics and its growth was not greatly affected when containing the recombinant plasmid pTEV231. Detailed kinetic studies demonstrated that it could utilize glucose and xylose in medium containing 0.5 % (w/v) yeast extract, and could produce low levels of L-lactate, acetate and ethanol. Kinetic evaluation of the newly isolated G. thermoglucosidasius M10EXG showed it could grow on fully defined media and coferment glucose and xylose. G. thermoglucosidasius M10EXG produced higher levels of products (acetate, and L-lactate) at about 2 g/l each, compared to T. thermophilus HB27 although ethanol levels were only 0.1-0.2 g/l in shake flask fermentations under partially aerobic conditions.  Improved conditions for natural transformation of T. thermophilus HB27 were determined. Optimal conditions for electroporation of were: Milli-Q water washing of cells rather than with 10% (v/v) glycerol; an electrical field of 5 kV/cm; cell concentration of 1.4x1010 cells/ml; and a DNA concentration of 500 ng in 40 Fl (125 Fg/ml) which achieved a transformation efficiency of 3x103 transformants /Fg DNA.  The chloramphenicol resistance (cat) and green fluorescence protein (gfp) genes from pCJS10 were cloned into an E. coli -- T. thermophilus shuttle vector (pMK18) as possible selection markers at elevated temperatures. Both genes were expressed in E. coli DH5H and it was demonstrated that gfp expression in E. coli DH5H decreased as temperature increased to 45oC.

The pet operon containing adhT (with its promoter) from G.thermoglucosidasius M10EXG and pdc from Z. mobilis Zm4, was cloned into pMK18 and low level expression in E. coli JM109 occurred with some increase in ethanol production. However the pet operon was not expressed in T. thermophilus with pMK18.  For further gene expression studies, a new shuttle vector, pPOPTE (4-5 kb), based on the T. thermophilus plasmid pTEV231 (containing thermostable kanamycin resistance gene) was constructed. pPOPTE was capable of multiplying in both E. coli and T. thermophilus HB27 and demonstrated higher stability and transformation efficiency compared to pMK18.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol as fuel.</field><field name="subject">Thermophilic bacteria.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclic deposition of salt-laden dusts as an explanation of salinisation in a groundwater recharge zone Coleambally irrigation area Riverine plain NSW</field><field name="creator">Bell, Justin Robert William, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Salinisation of the shallow groundwater system has occurred coincident with the development of irrigation in the Coleambally Irrigation Area. Salinisation in irrigation areas has previously been attributed to the evaporative concentration of the water table; however, there are other sources of salt such as the accumulation of rainfall by vegetation and the dry deposition of salt-laden dusts.  A significant store of crystalline gypsum, together with high concentrations of Na, Mg and Confidence limit, was found within the previously unsaturated zone of the Upper Shepparton Formation. The salt store was identified both within and outside of the groundwater mound; therefore evaporative concentration of the water table cannot be the source of salt. The transition from regional groundwater quality, as applied as irrigation to the ground surface, to shallow groundwater quality is simply explained by solubilisation of this salt store in the presence of soil CO2.  Dating of basal palaeochannel sands indicates that the identified salt store, a profile of only 20 m, was accumulated during the last glacial cycle. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the peak in eluate salinity, at approximately 2 m below ground surface, is between 15,000 and 25,000 years old, coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum. The Last Glacial Maximum was a period of significantly enhanced aridity on the Australian continent. It was also found that the peak in eluate salinity coincided with a bi-modal particle size distribution. The bi-modal signature implies that these sediments were subject to the aeolian accession of dusts.  It was found that the contribution of salt from dry deposition of dusts exceeded the contribution from rainfall by at least 1.9 to 11 times during the last glacial cycle. The results of this study imply that salt-laden dusts have, and continue to play an important role in the salinity and sodicity of soils in the Coleambally Irrigation Area and beyond.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil salinization -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="subject">Irrigation -- Environmental aspects -- New South Wales -- Coleambally.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treating emotion perception deficits following traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Bornhofen, Cristina, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">While the cognitive disturbances that frequently follow severe TBI are relatively well understood, the ways in which these affect the psychosocial functioning of people with TBI are yet to be determined and have thus received little attention in treatment research. Growing evidence indicates that that a significant proportion of individuals with TBI demonstrate deficits in the perception of affective information from the face, voice, bodily movement and posture. As accurate evaluation of emotion in others is critical for the successful negotiation of social interactions, effective treatments are necessary. Until recently, however, there have been no rehabilitation efforts in this area with TBI groups. The present research aims to redress this absence. The literature on emotion perception deficits in TBI is examined, and a theoretical rationale for intervention is presented. Several lines of research are reviewed which suggest that rehabilitation targeting such deficits is tenable. These include research on emotion perception remediation with other cognitively impaired populations, findings from cognitive neuroscience suggesting the potential for neuronal restoration after brain damage, and the successful applications of remediation techniques, in particular errorless learning and self-instruction, for treating other cognitive deficits in a range of neurological disorders and TBI. Discussion of this research is followed by a description of two randomised controlled trials aimed at improving emotion perception in individuals with TBI. The findings are discussed with reference to useful theoretical models of rehabilitation, learning and emotion perception.

For comparative purposes, it also maps the values shaping the views of asylum among leaders of a supra-national organization (the European Commission) and of a major non-government organization (the Jesuit Refugee Service).  The findings support the view that a culture of control permeates Australian asylum policy decisions, and that the quest for control stems from perceptions of national interest as articulated in immigration and foreign policy. However, beneath this it shows the primary values shaping policy to be nation building and good governance in the case of the Australian leaders, and (European) community building in the case of European Commission leaders.  Building on a 'caring for us, caring for them' conundrum found running through the values of all three groups of leaders, and seeking a secular equivalent to the faith-inspired relational approach of the Jesuit Refugee Service leaders, the thesis explores the contribution an ethics of care might make to asylum policy design, delivery and evaluation. It argues that such an approach, in which care is conceived as a value, process and practice rather than a sentiment or theory, is well suited to the area, especially when refined to provide for the work of empathy and imagination. It concludes by considering the potential implications for Australian asylum policy if an ethics of care were adopted.  The primary goals of the thesis are a better understanding of the issues involved in asylum policy, and the articulation of an ethical approach potentially as engaging of policy insiders as of policy spectators.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asylum, Right of -- Government policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In black: the performative and transactional objects in death</field><field name="creator">Strati, Susanna, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates particular ways that memorialising and mourning can be made manifest through public commemorative objects and spaces such as memorials and through smaller scale personal mementos. It also examines ways that these physical reminders can act as repositories and markers for memory, and as metaphors for identity. In particular the research is focussed on Traditional Southern Italian customs, reflecting on the ways that keepsakes and the cenotaph can provide allegories for declining cultural practices of Southern Italian migrants in Australia. The data collected for this thesis is based partly on participant observation, and on informal conversations with migrants from Southern Italy, regarding their funerary practices and stories told about the rural areas left behind in Italy.  Research of visual and published material in the area of memorialising and memorial object are examined in order to gain an understanding of the language of death. The thesis also examines the use of Catholic religious objects in what anthropologist Per Binde has coined 'transactional acts', during supplication and remembrance and during times of mourning. An exploration of memorial and memento objects, by contemporary practitioners including Christian Boltanski, Lindy Lee, Julie Blyfield and Maya Lin has also been included. Inclusion of contemporary artists reflects on how memorials continue to play an important role in today's society as well as being integral in reflecting identity and maintaining connections with the past.  Investigation of this genre is expressed through the research document and a body of studio-based research connected to the traditions of Memorialising. The studio research is expressed in the exhibition 'In Black' through the language of Catholic religious objects, memory boxes, personal mementos and cultural signifiers in wax, metal, and installation. These works, as time capsules are filled with significant representations of individuals and events that evoke memories through depictions of life, significant places and words descriptive of time and place.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memorials.</field><field name="subject">Mourning customs in art.</field><field name="subject">Mourning customs -- Italy, Southern.</field><field name="subject">Italy, Southern -- Social life and customs.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Such a longing': black and white children in welfare in New South Wales and Tasmania, 1880-1940</field><field name="creator">Parry, Naomi, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">When the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission tabled Bringing them home, its report into the separation of indigenous children from their families, it was criticised for failing to consider Indigenous child welfare within the context of contemporary standards. Non-Indigenous people who had experienced out-of-home care also questioned why their stories were not recognised. This thesis addresses those concerns, examining the origins and history of the welfare systems of NSW and Tasmania between 1880 and 1940. Tasmania, which had no specific policies on race or Indigenous children, provides fruitful ground for comparison with NSW, which had separate welfare systems for children defined as Indigenous and non-Indigenous. This thesis draws on the records of these systems to examine the gaps between ideology and policy and practice.  The development of welfare systems was uneven, but there are clear trends. In the years 1880 to 1940 non-Indigenous welfare systems placed their faith in boarding-out (fostering) as the most humane method of caring for neglected and destitute children, although institutions and juvenile apprenticeship were never supplanted by fostering. Concepts of child welfare shifted from charity to welfare; that is, from simple removal to social interventions that would assist children's reform. These included education, and techniques to enlist the support of the child's family in its reform. The numbers of non-Indigenous children taken into care were reduced by economic and environmental measures, such as payments to single mothers.  The NSW Aborigines Protection Board dismissed boarding-out as an option for Indigenous children and applied older methods, of institutionalisation and apprenticeship, to children it removed from reserves. As non-Indigenous welfare systems in both states were refined, the Protection Board clung to its original methods. It focussed on older children, whilst allowing reserves to deteriorate, and reducing the rights of Aboriginal people. This cannot simply be explained by race, for Tasmania did not adopt the same response.  This study shows that the policies of the Aborigines Protection Board were not consonant with wider standards in child welfare of the time. However, the common thread between Indigenous and non-Indigenous child removal was the longing of children and their families for each other.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Relocation -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Stolen generations (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Relocation -- Tasmania.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new multiaxial creep damage model based on the exhaustion of internal energy.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Lawrence Kiam Yam, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The creep of materials is a research topic of major significance in the life assessment and design of many modern engineering components of advance technology such as: power generation plant, chemical plant, gas turbines, jet engines, spacecrafts, components made of plastics and polymers, etc. To predict the creep lives of such components, one necessary ingredient is a creep damage model. The current creep damage models are either too cumbersome to be readily employed and/or not sufficiently accurate for practical applications.  This thesis describes a new creep damage model to overcome some of the major shortcomings in current creep damage/life prediction methods. The proposed model is relatively simple and readily applicable to industrial cases yet it is sufficiently accurate. The proposed model assumes that, on a macroscopic level, the energy dissipated in the material may be taken as a measure of creep damage induced in the material. In another words, creep damage is directly proportional to the absorbed internal energy density (IED), i.e., the internal energy per unit of volume. In this way, the model takes into account both multiaxial loading and deformation. The model is formulated when the creep constitutive relationships may be expressed by primary plus steadystate or steady-state alone (IED-SS) as well as for the cases when the material behaviour includes the creep tertiary region (IED-T).  The proposed model has been verified by applying it to various components for which the experimental creep lives are available from literature including thick/thin cylindrical vessels, notch bars with various notch-root radii and materials, multi-material cross welds bars, and perforated biaxial plates. The predicted creep lives of these components by the proposed model (IED-SS and IED-T) are compared with the experimental results and those obtained by the Reference Stress Method (RSM). It is shown that the maximum errors in relation to the creep lives of the above-mentioned components are: 18% when IED-SS is applied, 38% when IED-T is applied, and 301% when RSM is applied.  To estimate the effects of uncertainties in material data on the predicted creep life, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted. To this end and in relation to Norton creep law, material parameters such as creep stress coefficient and stress exponent are considered. In addition, the sensitivity analysis included the uncertainties related to the uniaxial creep rupture data. As might be expected, the results suggest that the predicted creep life is most sensitive to the creep stress.  Finally, the present research reveals that the proposed model is simple, practical and can be used in conjunction with any commercial finite element code with creep analysis capabilities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Materials -- Creep.</field><field name="subject">Creep -- Measurement.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial neural nets: a critical analysis of their effectiveness as empirical technique for cognitive modelling.</field><field name="creator">Krebs, Peter Rudolf, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the computational modelling and simulation of physiological structures and cognitive functions of brains through the use of artificial neural nets. While the structures of these models are loosely related to neurons and physiological structures observed in brains, the extent to which we can accept claims about how neurons and brains really function based on such models depends largely on judgments about the fitness of (virtual) computer experiments as empirical evidence. The thesis examines the computational foundations of neural models, neural nets, and some computational models of higher cognitive functions in terms of their ability to provide empirical support for theories within the framework of Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP). Models of higher cognitive functions in this framework are often presented in forms that hybridise top-down (e.g. employing terminology from Psychology or Linguistics) and bottom-up (neurons and neural circuits) approaches to cognition. In this thesis I argue that the use of terminology from either approach can blind us to the highly theory-laden nature of the models, and that this tends to produce overly optimistic evaluations of the empirical value of computer experiments on these models. I argue, further, that some classes of computational models and simulations based on methodologies that hybridise top-down and bottom-up approaches are ill-designed. Consequently, many of the theoretical claims based on these models cannot be supported by experiments with such models. As a result, I question the effectiveness of computer experiments with artificial neural nets as an  empirical technique for cognitive modelling.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive neuroscience.</field><field name="subject">Cognition -- Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Anatomy.</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Neurophysiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The making of a general: lost years, forgotten battles' lieutenant general Frank Berryman 1894-1941</field><field name="creator">Dean, Peter John, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the early military career and life of Lieutenant General Sir Frank Berryman from 1894 through to the end of his involvement in the Middle East campaigns. It begins with his family background and education on the outskirts of Melbourne before tracing, in detail, his personal life and military career until the end of 1941. The specific focus of this investigation is not just his military education and his role in the Cyrenaica and Syrian campaigns, but also the development of his personality and character. Personality and character provides a window of insight that not only helps to illuminate Berryman?s performance as an officer and his professional relationships but it also allows for a deeper understanding of this complex individual. This thesis argues that these, the 'lost years' and 'forgotten battles' , are integral to developing an understanding of this exceptional officer. In Berryman we see an important staff officer and commander whose place in Australia's military history has been largely overlooked.  One of the central themes of this work is that Berryman has been misunderstood and misrepresented within the existing historiography. He was one of the most important figures in the Australian Army during the Second World War and it was during the period covered in this thesis that he established his reputation as a commander and staff officer. Key to this investigation, therefore, is the themes of Berryman's developing leadership and culture of command. This work seeks to reveal the nature and experience of a highly successful officer who is also, to a great extent, representative of a generation of permeant Staff Corps officers who have largely been ignored within the genre of Australian military biography.  Ultimately this thesis concludes that Berryman was a central figure in the Australian Army's success in Cyrenaica and Syria. He demonstrated all of the qualities essential for a successful commander and senior officer and it was in these battles and his earlier military and life experiences that set the stage for his exceptional performance and contribution to the success of the Australian Army, not only in the Middle East but also later in the South West Pacific Campaigns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Berryman, Frank, 1894-1941.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Army -- Officers -- History.</field><field name="subject">Generals -- Australia -- Biography.</field><field name="subject">World War, 1014-1918 -- Campaigns -- Middle East.</field><field name="subject">World War, 1039-1945 -- Campaigns -- Pacific Area.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and experimental modelling of stress within the neck of endoluminal grafted artery</field><field name="creator">Huang, Henry Yen-Chin, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The success of endoluminal stent-graft treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm relies on maintenance of an effective seal when the stent expands into the healthy artery.  Clinical observation of aortic neck dilation following endoluminal grafting has led to the hypothesis that excessive stent expansion forces may cause remodelling and dilation of the artery to accommodate the strong forces.  This may lead to failure of the seal, hence so-called endoleak.  In this research, we analysed the force field generated by aortic stent-grafts and investigated in vitro approaches for studying the effects of these forces on cells within the vascular wall.  The pressure-deformation behaviour of ovine arteries was examined experimentally and was found to vary with artery type.  A finite element model of abdominal aorta (AA) characterised by Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic material properties was validated.  The property inputs were derived from the polynomial form of the strain energy density function proposed by Patel and Vaishnav. Stent-artery contact simulations revealed stresses 1.2-19 times higher than within a normal vessel at 120 mmHg when contacted by a zig-zag, square cross-section stent that expanded the AA by 3-16%. Streses 1.3-23 times normal were predicted for circular cross-section stents at the same range of expansions.  The stress distribution was determined to be concentrated at the contacting surface and within the inner region of the aortic wall.  These results confirmed that the forces within the vessel wall are likely to place unnatural physiological demands on the cells within. We then developed an in vitro system for studying the impact of this mechanical stress on cells within a three dimensional (3D) structure. A 20 wt% poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) - 5 wt% collagen tubular construct was developed to support cells, and was shown to sustain physiological blood pressures.  Two cell-seeding techniques were examined, direct cell encapsulation and surface cell-seeding.  Both demonstrated the capability of entrapping viable cells within the construct that remained viable for up to 4 days. In conclusion, stent contact does create abnormal stress concentrations within the vessel wall with a magnitude severely higher than physiological levels.  A feasible tubular construct and an in vitro system were developed, enabling further assessments on the effects of these abnormality on the cells.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial grafts</field><field name="subject">Aortic aneurysms</field><field name="subject">Stents (Surgery)</field><field name="subject">Stress (Physiology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diversity and systematics of marsupial lions from the Riversleigh world heritage area and the evolution of the Thylacoleonidae</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Anna K, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The fossil record of marsupial lions (family Thylacoleonidae) from Australian Oligo Miocene deposits is generally poor. Study of new material of this family collected from Oligo-Miocene limestone sediments of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland adds significant new information about previously described species and also indicates a greater diversity of thylacoleonids during this period of geological time. Two new genera and five new species are described. Reassessment of the holotype of the type species of Priscileo, P. pitikantensis,indicates it shows stronger affinities to species of the genus Wakaleo than it does to Priscileo roskellyae. Priscileo is regarded here to be a junior synonym of Wakaleo. The cranium and lower dentition of Priscileo roskellyae show significant morphological differences from species of Wakaleo, and this species is referred to a new genus, Lekaneleo. Distinctive morphological differences are identified in the M3s of Wakaleo oldfieldi and W. vanderleueri, species previously distinguished only by relative size differences in their dentitions. Functional morphological assessment of postcranial remains of species of Wakaleo suggests that they were probably scansorial or arboreal, but does not support a previous hypothesis of a fossorial habit. Cladistic analyses of the interrelationships of marsupial lions support the referral of Priscileo pitikantensis to the genus Wakaleo. The monotypic genus Microleo is the sister-group to all remaining thylacoleonid taxa. Species of Lekaneleo are the sistergroup to a Wakaleo/Thylacoleo clade. Intraordinal relationships of thylacoleonids were also investigated. Phylogenetic analyses of the interrelationships of Diprotodontia that included representatives of all extinct vombatiform families as well as extant taxa were conducted employing cranial and dental morphological characters. These analyses provide support for the hypothesis that Thylacoleonidae are members of the suborder Vombatiformes. Two species of Wakaleo (W. oldfieldi and W. vanderleueri) present in Riversleigh deposits are also found at other localities - respectively, the Leaf Locality of central Australia (Kutjamarpu LF) and the Small Hills Locality of northern Australia (Bullock Creek LF) - and suggest age estimations of the relevant Riversleigh sites of early Miocene and late Miocene. The phyletic evolution of Wakaleo suggests that some Riversleigh deposits are probably late Oligocene in age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thylacoleonidae.</field><field name="subject">Marsupials, Fossil -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vision-based navigation and decentralized control of mobile robots.</field><field name="creator">Low, May Peng Emily, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis documents experimental investigation into the use of vision for wheeled robot navigation problems. Specifically, using a video camera as a source of feedback to control a wheeled robot toward a static and a moving object in an environment in real-time. The wheeled robot control algorithms are dependent on information from a vision system and an estimator.  The vision system design consists of a pan video camera and a visual gaze algorithm which attempts to search and continuously maintain an object of interest within limited camera field of view. Several vision-based algorithms are presented to recognize simple objects of interest in an environment and to calculate relevant parameters required by the control algorithms. An estimator is designed for state estimation of the motion of an object using visual measurements. The estimator uses noisy measurements of relative bearing to an object and object's size on an image plane formed by perspective projection. These measurements can be obtained from the vision system.  A set of algorithms have been designed and experimentally investigated using a pan video camera and two wheeled robots in real-time in a laboratory setting. Experimental results and discussion are presented on the performance of the vision-based control algorithms where a wheeled robot successfully approached an object in various motions.  The second part of this thesis investigates the coordination problem of flocking in multi-robot system using concepts from graph theory. New control laws are presented for flocking motion of groups of mobile robots based on several leaders.

I recognise a persistent manner of working within my art practice that utilises geometry, mathematics and colour to arrive at compositions that have a sense of beauty and equilibrium.  Abstraction has been of significant interest to me and the three collections of work that I developed during my Master of Fine Arts studies - 'Colour:Form:Ratio', 'Photography-Free Zone' and 'Construction-Abstraction' -  illustrate the different ways I have applied my interests in abstraction.  Until the completion of the 'Colour:Form:Ratio' painting series my approach to abstraction was cerebral and self-reliant. While I was satisfied with results of my initial investigations and experimentation with abstract forms in painting I felt that the work lacked a social connection. I thus became interested in addressing what I perceived as this shortfall in my abstract painting.  A new  body of photographic work that had been evolving in parallel to my painting practice seemed to offer a solution. I realised that the photographs could be used to construct a new version of abstract composition. The images shared a similar colour and geometrical configuration to that illustrated in the 'Colour:Form:Ratio' Series. With this breakthrough, I began 'painting by eye', replacing my brush and palette with the camera and using it to capture and frame colours and geometric forms from my surrounding environment. In order to test my new methodology of arriving at abstract compositions extracted from the world around me, I selected two communally shared  spaces - the gallery/museum and the construction site - as the sourcing ground for my photographs. The result of my experimentation has been two collections of work: 'Photography-Free Zone' and 'Construction-Abstraction'. Both series reflect my experience of the gallery/museum space and the construction site while illustrating the transferral of my painting process to the photographic medium. The most favourable realisation I made in the process of making these works was that the subject matter I captured with the camera possessed aesthetic and theoretical qualities in keeping with my former painted artistic vocabulary, despite being removed from the physical act of painting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space (Architecture)</field><field name="subject">Visual perception.</field><field name="subject">Painting, Abstract</field><field name="subject">Painting -- Technique.</field><field name="subject">Composition (Art)</field><field name="subject">Geometry in art.</field><field name="subject">Alice, Abi.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WmpR regulation of antifouling compounds and iron uptake in the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata</field><field name="creator">Stelzer, Sacha, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The dark-green pigmented marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas tunicata produces several extracellular compounds against a range of common fouling organisms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, diatoms, invertebrate larvae and algal spores. The regulator WmpR, which has N-terminal similarity to ToxR from Vibrio cholerae and CadC from Escherichia coli, controls all of the pigment and antifouling phenotypes. These compounds appear at the onset of stationary phase. The role of WmpR as a stationary phase regulator in P. tunicata was investigated in this thesis. Starvation and stress studies demonstrated that WmpR does not appear to control genes necessary for survival during carbon, phosphate or nitrogen starvation and UV/hydrogen peroxide stress. Intriguingly, phosphate starvation caused pigmentation of wmpR mutant (D2W2) logarithmic phase cells, suggesting a second regulation of the pigments (and thus antifouling compounds) that could be mediated by the PhoR/B twocomponent regulatory system. Proteomic analysis using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) found that 11 proteins were differentially regulated by WmpR, and the identities of some of these proteins suggested a role for WmpR as a general stationary phase regulator rather than a specific starvation or stress regulator. Gene expression studies using RNA-arbitrarily primed PCR introduced a new role for WmpR as a regulator of iron acquisition; a TonB-dependant outer membrane receptor gene and a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene were up-regulated in the stationary phase Wt strain compared to the D2W2 strain. An assay for iron-binding activity supported the proposal that the NRPS may be making a siderophore. Further studies demonstrated that WmpR is required for survival under long-term low-iron conditions and that the pigments and antifouling genes are down-regulated during low-iron, while biofilm formation is up-regulated. WmpR also appears to constitutively regulate the production of iron-binding compounds, a novel regulation of iron acquisition that has not been seen in other organisms studied so far. A model is proposed that describes WmpR as responding to environmental signals, including iron, and co-ordinating the expression of a complex regulon including a number of genes involved in iron acquisition, general stationary phase physiology and bioactive secondary metabolite production.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pseudoalteromonas</field><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="subject">Fouling organisms -- Control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical and biological modification of porous silicon photonic crystals.</field><field name="creator">Kilian, Kristopher, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Porous silicon (PSi) photonic crystals have aroused research interest as label-free chemical and biological sensing transducers owing to the ease of fabrication, high quality optics and a sensitive optical response to changes in efractive index. A major impediment to using PSi materials as sensors is the relative instability of the silicon surface to oxidation in ambient air and aqueous environments. This thesis reports methods for derivatising PSi towards realisation of 1-D silicon-based photonic materials for applications in biology and medicine.  Narrow-linewidth rugate filters, a class of photonic crystal, are fabricated on silicon to display a high reflectivity resonant line in the reflectance spectrum. The position of the resonance is sensitive to changes in refractive index, thus allowing quantification of infiltrating biological species. The efficacy of rugate filters as biosensing transducers requires 1) protection from aqueous degradation, 2) resistance to non-specific adsorption and  3) distal reactivity for coupling of biorecognition molecules. Two chemical strategies based on hydrosilylation of functional alkenes are compared for stabilising the PSi structure against oxidation whilst resisting non-specific adsorption of biomolecules.  Immobilisation of peptides to the organic layers is demonstrated for optical detection of protease enzymes. Introduction of protease results in cleavage of the immobilised peptides within the rugate filters, detected by an optical blue-shift to shorter wavelengths. To increase the sensitivity to proteolysis, covalent mmobilisation of biopolymers is evaluated using gelatin as a model substrate. Digestion of gelatin is detected down to 37 attomoles of protease. Furthermore, the surface chemistry allows specific capture of live cells and incubation with stimulated macrophages in tissue culture results in optical detection of released gelatinase enzymes.  The generality of the surface chemistry allows for a range of other biological applications to be investigated. An alternative biorecognition interface, hybrid lipid bilayer membranes, containing specific recognition elements for cholera toxin allows optical detection of affinity capture and concentration within the PSi. In addition, the suitability of chemically modified photonic crystals as reservoirs for mass spectrometry is evaluated towards biomolecule quantification after optical detection. A robust and flexible surface chemistry on PSi photonic crystals is critical to performance in a range of biological assays and a necessary requirement for wide-scale employment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemical engineering.</field><field name="subject">Porous silicon.</field><field name="subject">Photonic crystals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical programming approaches to the plastic analysis of skeletal structures under limited ductility.</field><field name="creator">Tangaramvong, Sawekchai, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a series of integrated computation-orientated methods using mathematical programming (MP) approaches to carry out, in the presence of simultaneous material and geometric nonlinearities, the realistic analysis of skeletal structures that exhibit softening and limited ductility. In particular, four approaches are developed. First, the entire structural behavior is traced by using the nonholo-nomic (path-dependent) elastoplastic analysis. Second, the stepwise holonomic anal-ysis approximates the actual nonholonomic behavior by using a series of holonomic counterparts. Third, the more tractable holonomic (path-independent) analysis is implemented to approximate the overall nonholonomic response. Finally, classical limit analysis is extended to cater for this class structures; the aim is to compute in a single step ultimate load and corresponding deformations, simultaneously.  The nonholonomic, stepwise holonomic and holonomic state formulations are developed as special instances of the well-known MP problem known as a mixed complementarity problem (MCP). Geometric nonlinearity is tackled via two alternative approaches, namely one that can cater for arbitrarily large deformations and the second for 2nd-order geometry effects only. The effects of combined bending and axial forces are included through a (hexagonal) piecewise linear yield locus that can accommodate either perfect plasticity or isotropic softening or hardening.  The extended limit analysis problem is formulated as an instance of the challenging class of so-called mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (MPECs). Two classes of solution approaches, namely nonlinear programming (NLP) based approaches and an equation based smoothing approach, are proposed to solve the MPEC.  A number of numerical examples are provided to validate the robustness and efficiency of all proposed methods, and to illustrate some key mechanical features expected of realistic frames that exhibit local softening behavior.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plastic engineering (Engineering)</field><field name="subject">Programming (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heterogeneous multi-pipeline application specific instruction-set processor design and implementation</field><field name="creator">Radhakrishnan, Swarnalatha, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Embedded systems are becoming ubiquitous, primarily due to the fast evolution of digital electronic devices. The design of modern embedded systems requires systems to exhibit, high performance and reliability, yet have short design time and low cost. Application Specific Instruction set processors (ASIPs) are widely used in embedded system since they are economical to use, flexible, and reusable (thus saves design time).  During the last decade research work on ASIPs have been carried out in mainly for single pipelined processors. Improving performance in processors is possible by exploring   the available parallelism in the program. Designing of multiple parallel execution    paths for parallel execution of the processor naturally incurs    additional cost.    The methodology presented in this dissertation has addressed the problem of improving performance in ASIPs, at minimal     additional cost. The devised methodology explores the available   parallelism of an application to generate a multi-pipeline heterogeneous ASIP. The processor design is application specific. No pre-defined IPs are used in the design. The   generated processor contains multiple standalone pipelined data paths, which are not necessarily identical, and are connected by the necessary bypass paths and control signals. Control unit are separate for each pipeline (though with the same clock) resulting in a simple and cost effective design. By using separate instruction and data memories (Harvard architecture) and by allowing memory access by two separate pipes, the complexity of the controller and buses are reduced. The impact of higher memory latencies is nullified by utilizing parallel pipes during memory access. Efficient bypass network selection and encoding techniques provide a better implementation.    The initial design approach with only two pipelines without bypass paths show speed improvements of up to 36% and switching activity reductions of up to 11%. The additional area costs around 16%. An improved design with different number of pipelines    (more than two) based on applications show on average of 77% performance improvement with overheads of: 49% on area; 51% on leakage power; 17% on switching activity; and 69% on code size. The design was further trimmed, with bypass path selection and encoding techniques, which show a saving of up to 32% of area and 34% of leakage power with 6% performance improvement and 69% of code size reduction compared to the design approach without these techniques in the multi pipeline design.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Application specific processors</field><field name="subject">ASIP</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous ASIPs</field><field name="subject">Multi-pipeline ASIPs</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous computing</field><field name="subject">Application-specific integrated circuits</field><field name="subject">Parallel programming (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Piping</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fully coupled fluid flow and geomechanics in the study of hydraulic fracturing and post-fracture production</field><field name="creator">Aghighi, Mohammad Ali, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work addresses the poroelastic effect on the processes involved in hydraulic fracturing and post-fracture production using a finite element based fully coupled poroelastic model which includes a triple system of wellbore-fracture-reservoir. A novel numerical procedure for modeling hydraulic fracture propagation in a poroelastic medium is introduced. The model directly takes into account the interaction of wellbore, hydraulic fracture and reservoir in a fully coupled manner. This allows realistic simulation of near fracture phenomena such as back stress and leak-off. In addition, fluid leak-off is numerically modeled based on the concept of fluid flow in porous media using a new technique for evaluating local pressure gradient. Besides, the model is capable of accommodating the zone of reduced pressure (including intermediate and fluid lag zones) at the fracture front so as to capture the behavior of fracture tip region more realistically. A fully coupled poroelastic model for gas reservoirs has been also developed using an innovative numerical technique. From the results of this study it has been found that fracture propagation pressure is higher in poroelastic media compared to that of elastic media. Also high formation permeability (in the direction normal to the hydraulic fracture) and large difference between minimum horizontal stress (in case of it being the smallest principal stress) and reservoir pressure reduce the rate of fracture growth. Besides, high pumping rate is more beneficial in elongating a hydraulic fracture whereas high viscous fracturing fluid is advantageous in widening a hydraulic fracture. It has been also shown that rock deformation, permeability anisotropy and modulus of elasticity can have a significant effect on fluid flow in a hydraulically fractured reservoir. Furthermore, it has been shown that long stress reversal time window and large size of stress reversal region can be caused by high initial pressure differential (i.e. the difference between flowing bottomhole pressure and reservoir pressure), low initial differential stress (i.e. the difference between maximum and minimum horizontal stresses) and low formation permeability in tight gas reservoirs. By taking advantage of production induced change in stress state of a reservoir, this study has also shown that a refracture treatment, if carried out in an optimal time window, can lead to higher economic gain. Besides, analysis of stress reversal region has depicted that a small region with high stress concentration in the vicinity of the wellbore could impede refracture from initiating at the desired place. Moreover, re-pressurization of the wellbore can result in further propagation of the initial fracture before initiation or during propagation of the secondary fracture.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oil wells -- Hydraulic fracturing.</field><field name="subject">Oil fields -- Production methods.</field><field name="subject">Gas wells.</field><field name="subject">Hydraulic fracturing.</field><field name="subject">Reservoir oil pressure.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The unpublished plays of Miles Franklin</field><field name="creator">Hedley, Jocelyn, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the publication of her novel, My Brilliant Career, in 1901, Miles Franklin became the darling of the Sydney literati. Great things were expected of the little girl from the bush. But five years later, nothing had eventuated; her talent, Miles thought, was barely recognised in Australia. In the hope of gaining greater writing opportunities, she shipped to Chicago where she became involved in social reform. It was hard work and ill paid, and though she bewailed the fact that it sapped her writing energy, she nonetheless felt a commitment to the cause such that she remained for almost a decade.  In her spare time, though, she continued to write -- and not just prose. More and more she wrote for the theatre, attempting to push into a world of which she had always dreamed. Blessed with a beautiful singing voice, she had long desired to be on the stage. This was impossible, though; her voice, she believed, had been ruined by bad training in her youth. To write for the stage, then, though a poor substitute, was at least in the field of her original ideal.  Miles' plays, though, are not remembered today, and are little thought of in scholarship, are considered, in fact, to have failed. This gives the false impression that they were always little thought of. Her correspondence, however, reveals that at least five of the plays were produced, indicating a certain level of success.  Miles Franklin's theatrical work, then, is surely worthy of further examination. This thesis looks at five of the plays in the light of Miles' life and in the light of the society in which she found herself. In turn, it uses the plays to reveal something of the nature of the playwright herself and to show that Miles Franklin's theatrical writing did not fail as once thought. In addition, it provides a complete bibliography of the plays (inclusive of locations), lists the duplications as they appear under alternate titles and provides synopses of a large number. This will make up for a gap in Miles Franklin scholarship and will facilitate other scholars in accessing the plays. This thesis, then, is an introduction to a new facet of Miles Franklin scholarship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian drama -- 20th century -- History and criticism.</field><field name="subject">Franklin, Miles, 1879-1954 -- Dramatic works.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Statistical analyses of extrasolar planets and other close companions to nearby stars.</field><field name="creator">Grether, Daniel Andrew, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">We analyse the properties of extrasolar planets, other close companions and their hosts. We start by identifying a sample of the detected extrasolar planets that is minimally affected by the selection effects of the Doppler detection method. With a simple analysis we quantify trends in the surface density of this sample in the Msini-period plane. A modest extrapolation of these trends puts Jupiter in the most densely occupied region of this parameter space, thus suggesting that Jupiter is a typical massive planet rather than an outlier. We then examine what fraction of Sun-like (~ FGK) stars have planets. We find that at least ~25% of stars possess planets when we limit our analysis to stars that have been monitored the longest and whose low surface activity allow the most precise radial velocity measurements. The true fraction of stars with planets may be as large as ~100%. We construct a sample of nearby Sun-like stars with close companions (period &lt; 5 years). By using the same sample to extract the relative numbers of stellar, brown dwarf and planetary companions, we verify the existence of a very dry brown dwarf desert and describe it quantitatively. Approximately 16% of Sun-like stars have close companions more massive than Jupiter: 11% +- 3% are stellar, &lt;1% are brown dwarf and 5% +- 2% are giant planets. A comparison with the initial mass function of individual stars and free-floating brown dwarfs, suggests either a different spectrum of gravitational fragmentation in the formation environment or post-formation migratory processes disinclined to leave brown dwarfs in close orbits.  Finally we examine the relationship between the frequency of close companions and the metallicity of their Sun-like hosts. We confirm and quantify a ~4 sigma positive correlation between host metallicity and planetary companions. In contrast we find a ~2 sigma anti-correlation between host metallicity and the presence of a stellar companion. Upon dividing our sample into FG and K sub-samples, we find a negligible anti-correlation in the FG sub-sample and a ~3 sigma anti-correlation in the K sub-sample. A kinematic analysis suggests that this anti-correlation is produced by a combination of low-metallicity, high-binarity thick disk stars and higher-metallicity, lower-binarity thin disk stars.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stars</field><field name="subject">Extrasolar planets</field><field name="subject">Stellar associations</field><field name="subject">Stars with planets</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fibre-optic sensing technology and applications in civil engineering.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Allan Chi-Lun, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the research and industry-related works carried out from the development of a fibre-optic strain sensor system for Civil Engineering applications. A sensor system consists of a number of core components, including the sensing element, interrogation/demodulation, multiplexing, signal processing and hardware equipment. In the process of development, a number of issues have been identified and investigated, which resulted in the improvement of the system performance, as well as the proposal of new techniques for the sensor system. First, an improved demodulation technique for a type of sensor, namely the fibre Fizeau interferometer (FFI), is presented. The technique is based on the improvement of the Fourier transform peak detection method, which suffers severely from the poor resolution and accuracy of finding the sensor cavity length. The improvement over the original method has been compared and verified through simulations and experiments. Second, a simultaneous demodulation technique for multiplexed FFI and fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensors using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is proposed. Third, a multiplexing technique using amplitude-modulated chirped FBGs and the DWT is proposed. These two proposed techniques have been demonstrated experimentally through strain measurements. The strain resolution, crosstalk and limitations are investigated. In addition, simultaneous quasi-static strain and temperature sensing of different metal plates are performed. Fibre-optic sensors have found numerous applications in different areas. In this thesis, the use of FBG sensors in Civil Engineering applications is demonstrated in four experimental studies, including: (i) long-term measurement of drying shrinkage and creep of structural grade concrete; (ii) simultaneous measurement of shrinkage and temperature of reactive powder concrete (RPC) at early-age; (iii) measurement of coefficients of thermal expansion of cement mortar and RPC; and (iv) field-trial on the strain monitoring of the world?s first RPC road bridge. In addition, the experimental and practical issues of using FBG sensors are considered.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical fiber detectors.</field><field name="subject">Fiber optical.</field><field name="subject">Diffraction gratings.</field><field name="subject">Strain gages.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/AIDS natural history and treatment in the Asia-Pacific region: the treat Asia HIV observational database.</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Jialun, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines HIV disease natural history and response to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in patients from The TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD), a mulitcentre, prospective observational cohort of HIV-infected patients from countries in the Asia-Pacific region.  By September 2005, 2979 patients have been recruited to TAHOD from 15 participating sites. The majority were male (73%), median age 37 years. Chinese (37%), Thai (25%) and Indian (17%) were the main ethnicities. Most patients reported HIV infection through heterosexual (59%) and homosexual contact (23%); 5% injecting drug use. At baseline, 41% of patients were diagnosed with AIDS defining illness, and 77% were being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  Baseline and retrospective data suggest that the overall response to HAART in TAHOD is similar to that seen in western cohorts, with mean CD4 count increase of 115 cells/&#956;L and 69% achieving a viral load less than 400 copies/mL six-month after HAART initiation. Baseline CD4 count was the strongest predictor of short-term disease progression. Prognostic models based on routine clinical data and haemoglobin gave a good estimation of disease progression. The rate of new AIDS defining illness was 26% in the first 90 days after HAART initiation, which may partly be due to immune reconstitution syndrome occurring shortly after treatment. The most frequently used first-line ART combination was stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Approximately 22% of patients receiving this treatment changed or stopped at least one drug in the first year, with adverse effect (including lipodystrophy, hepatitis, rash and peripheral neuropathy) the major reasons. The rates of discontinuation of efavirenz or nevirapine as part of HAART were similar (16 vs. 20/100 person years). Older age and positive HCV antibody were associated with an elevated liver function (ALT) test. Both prevalence of HBV and HCV coinfection with HIV were approximately 10%. The impact of hepatitis coinfection on immunological and virological responses to ART and HIV disease progression was not statistically significant. Both HBV and HCV remained independently associated with elevated ALT in the multivariate models.  The overall HIV disease progression and response to ART in TAHOD patients were similar to those seen in the western countries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Diagnosis -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Diagnosis -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Treatment -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Treatment -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Asia -- Statistics -- Databases.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Asia -- Statistics -- Databases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maturation of the transient chromatic (L-M) visual evoked potential: insights from linear and nonlinear analysis.</field><field name="creator">Boon, Mei Ying, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques have shown that chromatic contrast sensitivity improves between infancy and adolescence. In adults, electrophysiological and psychophysical methods usually agree. However, in infants electrophysiological techniques may underestimate ability to see chromatic contrast (Suttle et al., 2002). It is not known if the discrepancy between electrophysiological and psychophysical methods continues during childhood nor whether the chromatic VEP can be used as an indicator of colour perception in children.  Purpose: To investigate the transient L-M chromatic visual evoked potential and its ability to indicate perception (psychophysical thresholds) of chromatic stimuli in children and adults. In particular, to determine whether a discrepancy between VEP and psychophysical L-M thresholds exists during childhood and if so, to gain some understanding about the nature of the discrepancy.  Methods: Transient chromatic VEPs were recorded in children (aged 4.5-13 years) and adults (aged 20-40 years). VEP thresholds were compared with psychophysical thresholds (within-subjects comparison). Because the VEPs of the children were less intra-individually repeatable in morphology than those of the adults, post-hoc objective analysis of the VEPs, linear (Fourier) and nonlinear dynamical (Grassberger and Procaccia's (1983) correlation dimension) analyses, was conducted.  Results: VEP and psychophysical estimates of chromatic contrast thresholds agreed using a variety of methods in the adults. In the children, however, the objective methods of assessment (extrapolation from Fourier-derived amplitudes and the correlation dimension) were more accurate than the methods that employed subjective evaluations of VEP morphology.  Conclusion: The L-M transient chromatic VEPs of both children (aged 4.5-13 years) and adults appear to contain chromatic information, even in the absence of repeatable VEP morphology and should therefore be able to indicate chromatic perception (psychophysical thresholds). However, the chromatic information may be present as a nonlinear dynamical signal, which may require objective methods (Fourier analysis, the correlation dimension) to reveal the chromatic signal. The greater intra-individual variability of VEP morphology in children compared to adults may reflect poorer precision when switching between cortical states in children's brains. Alternatively, interactions between the immature visual system of the children and their general EEG may occur. Children's VEPs should therefore be interpreted differently to adult VEPs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Color vision.</field><field name="subject">Visual evoked response.</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials (Electrophysiology)</field><field name="subject">Phychophysiology -- Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Southern quest: a play and said and done: verbal and non-verbal information in contemporary theatrical writing.</field><field name="creator">Lozano, Carlos Enrique, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">My critical essay maps out the relationship between verbal and non-verbal information in contemporary theatrical writing.  It uses Lehmann's theory of a post-dramatic theatre and Pfister's analytical input to investigate different configurations of the information given by the characters' speech and the information given by their physical actions.  The ways in which these variables interrelate define the type of affiliation between theatre and drama in any given text.  My essay contends that the verbal and the non-verbal represent the two ends of the spectrum of possibilities of any written theatre text.  The predominance of one over the other will determine the extent to which the 'presence' of the dramatist intervenes in the staging of the work.  Using Old Times as a case study, I examine the way in which Pinter stretches the gap between the verbal and the non-verbal; by using his knowledge of the stage, he confronts the remoteness of the literary in theatrical writing.  My play Southern Quest recognizes the minds of the readers and of the spectators as the place where the closure of the gap occurs.  Its stage directions make of the stage, the properties and actions a creation that is parallel to the fictional one (only present in the dialogue of the characters).  There is a permanent discrepancy, not a contradiction, between what is said and what and where it is done that demands that the actual assembly of the possible fiction takes place in the receiver's mind.  The creative component draws on numerous elements analysed in the critical work, such as the discordance between the verbal and the non-verbal and the use of narrative monologues in theatrical writing.  The lack of agreement between the verbal and the non-verbal-a heightened discordance at the beginning and the end of the play, with a minimal discrepancy towards the centre-mirrors the characters' journey throughout the play: from existential doubt to physical agony and back.  The theoretical concerns addressed in the essay are explored in the writing of the play and my main formal drive in the creative piece is to explore the division between theatre and drama from within the text.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drama -- Technique.</field><field name="subject">Theater -- Semiotics.</field><field name="subject">Semiotics and literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the name of emancipation? Interrogating the politics of Canada?s human security discourse.</field><field name="creator">??zg????, Umut, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Canada has actively incorporated human security into its foreign policy framework ever since the first articulation of human security in the 1994 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Annual Report. The Canadian Government has been at the forefront of promoting the concept internationally, thereby identifying Canada as one of the leading 'humanist-activist' states. This thesis, however, takes a more skeptical approach towards the emancipatory claims of Canada's human security discourse. It argues that, despite its overarching humanistic tone, the question of who is secured through the language and operationalization of human security remains problematic. In examining Canada's human security discourse in reference to this central question, this thesis analyses the promotion and operationalization of human security within Canada and abroad. The central argument of this thesis is that with its overwhelmingly statist and liberal language, Canada's interpretation of human security is far from being a challenge to the traditional ontological claims of security as being the provider of political order. The Canadian human security agenda is driven by a traditional fear of national insecurity. It aims to secure national unity and identity in Canada, and its national and economic security abroad, by promoting the ideals of liberal democratic peace. Drawing upon the insights of critical security studies and post-structuralist approaches to international relations, this thesis reveals several meaning-producing effects of Canada's human security discourse. First, domestically, it perpetuates the truth claims of the discourse of Canadian identity by naturalizing the idea of Canadian goodness. Canada's human security discourse enhances the social control of the population by masking 'human insecurities' within Canada. Second, by framing 'failed' and 'fragile' states as a threat to Canadian security and liberal international order, the Canadian Government perpetuates the constant struggle between the zones of peace and the zones of chaos, and overcodes human security with simultaneously a statist and universalist language that aims to control as well as emancipate the 'borderlands' Third, while Canadian discourse on human security claims to encourage a bottom-up approach to security, it works ironically as an elitist policy which endorses an ideal form of governance in Canada and abroad.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights -- Canada.</field><field name="subject">Civil rights -- Canada.</field><field name="subject">Narional security -- Canada.</field><field name="subject">Canada -- Foreign relations.</field><field name="subject">Security, International -- Canada.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface plasmons for enhanced thin-film silicon solar cells and light emitting diodes</field><field name="creator">Pillai, Supriya, School of Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Photovoltaics (PV) is fast emerging as an attractive renewable energy technology due to concerns of global warming, pollution and scarcity of fossil fuel supplies. However to compete in the global energy market, solar cells need to be cheaper and more energy efficient. Silicon is the favorite semiconductor used in solar photovoltaic cells because of its ubiquity and established technology, but due to its indirect bandgap silicon is a poor absorber and light emitter. Thin film cells play an important role in low cost photovoltaics, but at the cost of reduced efficiencies when compared to wafer based cells. There remains much untapped potential in thin-film solar cells which this work has attempted to exploit through exploring novel approaches of enhancing the efficiency of thin film cells using the optical properties of sub-wavelength metal nanoparticles. Metals are considered as strong absorbers of light because of their large free-electron density. How can metals improve light trapping in solar cells? This question has raised several eyebrows and this thesis is an attempt to show that metal nanoparticles can be useful in producing efficient solar cells.  Subwavelength metal particles support surface modes called surface plasmons when light is incident on them, which cause the particles to strongly scatter light into the underlying waveguide or substrate, enhancing absorption. The process of coupling thin film silicon waveguide modes to plasmonic metals using unpolarised light at normal incidence is applied to silicon-based solar cells and light emitting diodes, and enhanced photocurrent and electroluminescence is realized with potential for further optimisation and improvement. The results from this study correspond to a current increase of up to 19% from planar wafer based cells and up to 33% increase from 1.25 micron thin-film silicon-on-insulator structures for the AM1.5 global spectrum. We also report for the first time an up to twelve fold increase in electroluminescence signal from 95nm thick light-emitting diodes. From the results we conclude that this method which involves simple techniques of nanoparticle deposition and characterization could hold important implications in the improvement of thin-film silicon cell absorption / emission efficiencies where conventional methods of light trapping are not feasible, resulting in promising near-term applications of surface plasmons in photovoltaics and optoelectronics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasmons (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Thin film devices.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles.</field><field name="subject">Light emitting diodes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using markets to implement energy and environmental policy. Considerations of the regulatory challenges and lessons learned from the Australian experience and laboratory investigation using experimental economics</field><field name="creator">Nolles, Karel, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Government is constantly attempting to balance the competing interests within society, and is itself active in a variety of different roles. The conflict between these roles becomes particularly clear when an attempt is made to implement a "regulatory market" - that is a market that exists only because of government action- such as an electricity or environmental market - to implement some policy objective, since it is the nature of markets to candidly reveal weaknesses that in a non-market management framework may have remained hidden for some time. This thesis examines the difficulty that government has in setting market rules that implement an efficient market design for such markets. After examining the history and development of the Australian Electricity Industry market reform process, we examine more closely some of the electricity related environmental markets developed specifically to drive a policy outcome in Australia -- in particular the Australian Mandatory Renewable Energy Target Market (MRET) and the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme. By comparing these environmental markets with established financial markets, and using the techniques of experimental economics, we show that these environmental markets have significant inefficiencies in their design. We argue that these come about because lessons from the financial markets have not be learned by those implementing environmental markets, that stakeholders are lobbying for market design characteristics that are not in fact in their own best interests, and that governments struggle to manage the divergent pressure upon them. For example, in MRET we show experimentally that one of the market design characteristics most fought for by generators (the ability to create renewable energy certificates from qualifying energy without declaring the certificates to the market until a later time of the creator's choosing) in fact leads to market volatility, and ultimately inefficiently low prices. We also examine the impact on the overall MRET market of simple rule changes upon market performance.  Key conclusions of this thesis are that it is more difficult than has been appreciated to successfully use a market to implement public policy and that important lessons have not yet been learned from the existing financial markets.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy policy -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Environmental policy -- Economic aspects -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises -- Government policy -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Competition -- Government policy -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge based anomaly detection</field><field name="creator">Prayote, Akara, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Traffic anomaly detection is a standard task for network administrators, who with experience can generally differentiate anomalous traffic from normal traffic. Many approaches have been proposed to automate this task. Most of them attempt to develop a sufficiently sophisticated model to represent the full range of normal traffic behaviour. There are significant disadvantages to this approach. Firstly, a large amount of training data for all acceptable traffic patterns is required to train the model. For example, it can be perfectly obvious to an administrator how traffic changes on public holidays, but very difficult, if not impossible, for a general model to learn to cover such irregular or ad-hoc situations.   In contrast, in the proposed method, a number of models are gradually created to cover a variety of seen patterns, while in use. Each model covers a specific region in the problem space. Any novel or ad-hoc patterns can be covered easily. The underlying technique is a knowledge  acquisition approach named Ripple Down Rules. In essence we use Ripple Down Rules to partition a domain, and add new partitions as new situations are identified. Within each supposedly homogeneous partition we use fairly simple statistical techniques to identify anomalous data. The special feature of these statistics is that they are reasonably robust with small amounts of data. This critical situation occurs whenever a new partition is added.  We have developed a two knowledge base approach. One knowledge base partitions the domain. Within each domain statistics are accumulated on a number of different parameters. The resultant data are passed to a knowledge base which decides whether enough parameters are anomalous to raise an alarm. We evaluated the approach on real network data. The results compare favourably with other techniques, but with the advantage that the RDR approach allows new patterns of use to be rapidly added to the model.  We also used the approach to extend previous work on prudent expert systems - expert systems that warn when a case is outside its range of experience. Of particular significance we were able to reduce the false positive to about 5%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Security measures.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Access control.</field><field name="subject">Computer security.</field><field name="subject">Data protection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public health approaches to measurement, surveillance and the promotion of walking among Australian adults</field><field name="creator">Merom, Dafna, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate the importance of walking to public health. The first part is characterized by epidemiological research. First, a typology for the measurement of walking is developed. A systematic review is conducted of observational studies to determine the health benefits of walking in its own right. Studies consistently confirm that 30 minutes walking on most days of the week is sufficient to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and non-communicable disease risk. Then, a series of epidemiological analyses describes the prevalence and correlates of walking, using multiple health and non-health surveillance data sets. Surveillance data indicate that the prevalence of walking at the above recommended levels is low across all domains. Between 1991 and 2001 an increase in walking occurred, and was the main contributor to reductions in leisure time physical inactivity; however, the proportion of the population who achieved the recommended amount of physical activity by walking did not change in leisure and transport domains. The next part of the thesis is characterized by health promotion research examining the impact of three population-based approaches to increasing walking among Australian adults. The first was an evaluation of a conversion of rail to trail, as an environmental change intervention; the second was a mass media campaign promoting walking to work, and the third was a targeted print media walking program. Providing environmental supports with minimal promotion had no effect on walking. A nation-wide mass media campaign promoting walking to work increased walking and other moderate intensity physical activity, but process evaluation indicated other promotional efforts contributed as well. The targeted print media randomised trial had the greatest effect on walking, but the increases were not greater than spontaneous change in the control. Increases in total physical activity were achieved only when the intervention was supplemented by the use of a pedometer. The expectation that broader approaches to the promotion of walking will bring about changes at the population level, were not corroborated by these case studies. There is a need for enhancement of walking-specific interventions to influence total PA at the population levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Walking -- Health aspects.</field><field name="subject">Physical fitness -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Public health -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Health promotion-- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology -- Methodology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of glucocorticoid and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor therapy in a mouse model of chronic asthma</field><field name="creator">Herbert, Cristan, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Using a murine model which replicates many characteristic features of human asthma, this study evaluated the effects of treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs on the lesions of chronic asthma, and investigated potential underlying molecular mechanisms. Treatment with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, was compared with roflumilast, a novel phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. BALB/c mice sensitised to ovalbumin were challenged with a low mass concentration of aerosolised antigen for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 6 weeks. In weeks 5 and 6, groups of animals were treated with either dexamethasone or roflumilast. Assessment included changes in acute-on-chronic inflammation, structural remodelling of the airways and airway hyper-responsiveness to a bronchoconstrictor stimulus. These were correlated with the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Compared to vehicle-treated control animals, dexamethasone- and roflumilast-treated mice exhibited reduced accumulation of intra-epithelial eosinophils and chronic inflammatory cells, including CD3+ T-lymphocytes in the airways. Similarly, both drugs inhibited subepithelial fibrosis and airway epithelial thickening, although only dexamethasone inhibited goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia. Airway hyper-reactivity was not diminished by either drug. Both treatments suppressed production of Th2 cytokines by ovalbumin-restimulated peribronchial lymph node cells. In selectively dissected airway tissue from vehicletreated animals, increased expression of mRNA for several pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, GM-CSF, IL-6) and cytokines characteristic of Th1 (IFN-&#947;), Th2 (IL-5, IL-13)and Th17 (IL-17A) cells was demonstrated using real-time PCR. Enhanced expression of growth factors (TGF-&#946;1 and FGF-2) was also demonstrated in airway epithelium isolated by laser capture microdissection. Interestingly, whereas treatment with dexamethasone significantly inhibited expression of mRNA for all of the inflammationrelated cytokines examined, roflumilast inhibited only IL-17A, TNF-&#945;, GM-CSF and IL-6. Both drugs inhibited mRNA expression of growth factors by epithelial cells.

I am using the development from mechanical Automata to mass production juxtaposed to Charlie Chaplin??s film and Jean Tinguelys kinetic art, as examples for the change of the social condition from the industrialisation to the current post-industrial era.  The change of social condition I refer to as the ??depersonalisation?? or ??dehumanisation?? effect supported by my working experiences in the health system. The ??medicalisation of the life span?? and the discrepancy of creating a sustainable future less profit orientated are two indicators of how far we have been removed from our bodies. These observations are supported by the writing of Ivan Illich??s Medical Nemesis and Frank Schirrmachers?? analysis of the change of the social structure using the family configuration as an example. These conceptual ideas are visualised by a selection of kinetic art works and video installations. In the heart of this body of work is the process-orientated documentation of Zero AGL project. The project documents the journey of a discarded airplane that was re-assembled and reanimated by myself and a group of volunteers supported by local businesses. The struggle of the group of people stands as a metaphor for the current dilemma of the restricted usage of public space. Further it reflects on my own limitations dealing with the Australian outback culture and the transition of my own sculptural practice from small scale art works into the arena of life size public Art. Those experiences shaped the process and the direction of the project. The motivation for the creation of the body of kinetic sculptures and video installation is to highlight the absurdity of social constructed categories and controlling systems in a post-industrial society. The subject matter focuses on the social construction of the categories of the ??Norm?? and the limitations of failure. Latitudinaria gives the audience a lateral view on how human betterment is not always essentially connected to technological progress but on transforming ideas and enhancing it from a different point of view. * freedom from normal restraints, limitations and regulations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art and society</field><field name="subject">Depersonalization</field><field name="subject">Kinetic sculpture</field><field name="subject">Video art</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="subject">Tinguely, Jean -- 1925-</field><field name="subject">Illich, Ivan, 1926- -- Medical nemesis</field><field name="subject">Schirrmachers, Frank</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of specific genetic host factors, specific dietary factors and Helicobacter pylori infection on the risk of gastric cancer</field><field name="creator">Ha, Mai Dung, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Gastric cancer (GC) is ranked as the second most common fatal malignancy worldwide. Although Helicobacter pylori is recognized as a major predisposing factor for non-cardia GC, infection alone is not sufficient to cause cancer. This thesis aimed to determine the variation in host genetic polymorphisms in subjects from Malaysia and Singapore and to examine the role of H. pylori infection, host genetic factors and dietary factors in the etiology of non-cardia GC in Chinese subjects resident in Malaysia.  Methods: Functional dyspepsia (FD) controls from three ethnic groups in Malaysia, Chinese (123), Indian (110) and Malay (84) and Singaporean Chinese (127) plus Malaysian Chinese gastric cancer cases (55)were examined. Polymorphisms in IL-1B-511, IL-1RN, IL-10 cluster, TNFA-308 and TLR5+1174 were determined by PCR-RFLP or PCR; H. pylori status by serology, dietary intake by questionnaire and gastric IL-1b levels by real time PCR.  Results: 1) Significant differences existed in the frequency of all polymorphisms, except IL-1B-1473 and TNFA-308, in the three Malaysian ethnic groups and in the IL-1B-511 polymorphism in Malaysian and Singaporean Chinese FD 2) Globally, two distinct patterns of IL-1B-511, IL-1RN, IL-10-1082, IL-10-592 and TNFA-308 exist, Western and East-Asian 3) In Malaysian Malays, the IL-10 ATA haplotype was associated with H. pylori susceptibility 4) In Malaysian Chinese an increased risk of GC was associated with carriage of the IL-1B-1473 G allele {OR=4.4(1.3-15.3)} and the IL-1B-511 C allele {OR=1.8(0.8-4.1)} 5) Increased levels of IL-1b were observed in Singaporean and Malaysian Chinese FD subjects carrying the IL-1-511C and IL-1-1473G alleles 6) Malaysian Chinese not consuming fresh fruit and vegetables had the highest risk of GC {OR=10.2 (3.4-30.6)} 7) The highest risk of GC {OR=37.3(3.3-424.8)} was observed in H. pylori positive Malaysian Chinese who carried both the IL-1B-511C and IL-1B-1473G alleles and did not consume fresh fruit and vegetables.  Conclusions: In Malaysian Chinese, H. pylori infection, host genetic and dietary factors all contribute to the risk of GC. However the significant difference observed in the frequency of host genetic polymorphisms within and between ethnic groups suggests that a single group of risk factors cannot be used to determine GC risk across all populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori infections.</field><field name="subject">Nutritionally induced diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theories of photography in the visual arts classroom</field><field name="creator">Jones, Susanne Rae, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the findings from a series of experimental investigations that explore young people's transition from socially constrained image making to innovative photographic practice within the art education context. It identifies the constraints young peoples' vernacular theories about what makes a good photograph, have on their own photographic origination. It draws on the work of Berti and Freeman (1997) and Karmiloff-Smith (1992) and accepts underlying descriptions of theory of mind development in young children (Wellman 1990). The data was collected from 117 adolescents (72 girls and 45 boys) aged between 10 and 17 years old, who were attending government primary and secondary schools in Sydney Australia between late 2001 and mid 2003. The schools were located in and around Sydney's eastern, western and south-western suburbs and ranged from the inner city to the semi-rural hinterland. The students represent a range of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds.  Participants' theories about photography and what makes 'good' and 'bad' photographs was ascertained by asking a series of structured questions at interview and analysing written responses to a questionnaire Five experimental situations produced 1344 photographs which were coded and analysed using ANOVA to establish between age-group and experimental task differences. The photographs were judged by expert photographers, for levels of innovation. Adolescents' explanations about the photographs they made were analysed for reflexive thinking. In order to map any shift in representational development throughout adolescence the data were divided into three age groups. 10-13 year old (n=40), 14-16 year olds (n=69) and 17 year olds(n=11). The study produced evidence that adolescents aged 10-13 years old had a na??ve theory of photography, and that 14-16 year olds had an emerging reflexive theory of photography, but they were constrained by both procedural understandings and social conventions of photography. Expert 17 year olds and adults have a reflexive theory of photography as evidenced by higher percentage of innovative images and more reflexive statements about their photographs. The findings provide baseline understandings of the cognitive processes implicit in photograph origination by adolescents and suggests implications for further research into the teaching and learning of photography as a creative medium in the Secondary School Visual Arts classroom.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art and photography.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Artistic -- Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing overland mobility of Cryptosporidium Oocysts</field><field name="creator">Kaucner, Christine E., Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The mechanisms responsible for overland transport of faecal pathogens, particularly Cryptosporidium oocysts, from animal sources to water bodies are not fully understood. Surface properties of microbes, such as electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity, are thought to contribute to their aggregation and attachment to solid surfaces. There is conflicting evidence that methods used to purify Cryptosporidium oocysts from faecal material may affect the oocyst surface, leading to biased conclusions from transport studies. By studying oocyst surface properties, aggregation and soil attachment, this thesis addressed whether oocyst purification methods influence overland transport studies, and whether oocysts are likely to be associated with particles during transport.  When using the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (MATH) assay with octane, oocyst hydrophobicity was shown to be method and isolate dependent, with oocysts displaying moderate to high hydrophobicity in 0.01 M KNO3. There was no observed attachment, however, to the hydrophobic octyl-SepharoseTM bead ligands when using the same suspension solution. Oocyst age did not appear to influence their hydrophobicity. A small but statistically significant proportion of oocysts displayed a net negative surface charge as observed by their attachment to an anion exchange ligand (DEAE). There was no difference in hydrophobicity or surface charge observed between purified oocysts and oocysts that had been extracted without the use of harsh chemicals and solutions with dehydrating properties.  Purified oocysts did not aggregate at pH values between 3.3 and 9.0, nor in solutions lower than 0.59 M in ionic strength at a pH 2.7 which is approaching the reported isoelectric point of oocysts. This finding suggests that oocysts may not form aggregates under general environmental conditions. The association of purified oocysts with soil particles was observed in settling columns. Attachment to soil particles was not conclusive since the settling of the soil particles may have entrained single oocysts. Nonetheless, approximately 27% of oocysts were estimated to be unbound to soil or associated with small soil particles. Hence models for oocyst overland transport should consider a significant fraction as single entities or associated with soil particles less than about 3 &#956;m in size.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crytosporidium.</field><field name="subject">Crytosporidium -- Eggs -- Dispersal -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Groundwater flow -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity and Life Course: A Long-term Perspective on the Lives of Australian-born Chinese</field><field name="creator">Ngan, Lucille, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the construction of ?Chineseness? by Australian-born Chinese through their interactions with mainstream ?white? society and Chinese diasporic communities in Australia. It represents an interdisciplinary study based on qualitative research and critical analysis of forty-three in-depth interviews with Australian-born Chinese whose families have resided in Australia for three generations or more. Diasporic narratives, fraught with contentions over belonging and difference, often lead to ambiguous ramifications of identity formation. While the notion of hybridity problematises the unsettling boundaries of identities, there is still a continuing perception that ethnic identification decreases over successive generations, resulting in assimilation. However, contrary to this assumption, this study shows that subsequent generations also encounter complicated experiences involving both feelings of cultural ambivalence and enrichment. While the rewriting of identity takes place against the varying circumstances of resettlement, the experiences and transitions across the respondents? life course concurrently inscribes Chineseness onto their lives in diverse ways. Furthermore, Chineseness is continually (re)constructed through decentered connections with an imaginary homeland. Consequently, despite generational longevity, strong affinities with Australian society and longstanding national identities grounded in Australian culture, Chineseness is still a significant part of their identity, whether they willingly choose to associate with it or not. The focus on revaluating the concept of Chineseness and elucidating the sense of identity of sequential generations has important ramifications for the development of a more informed theoretical model for understanding the long-term effects of migration, especially on the process of identity formation and feelings of home and belonging.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese Australians -- Ethnic identity.</field><field name="subject">Chinese Australians -- Interviews.</field><field name="subject">Chinese Australians -- Cultural assimilation.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia -- Social life and customs.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organised individualisation: ambiguities in the contemporary transformation of network capitalism.</field><field name="creator">Ebert, Norbert Felix, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Individualisation has become an ambiguous feature of late modern societies. It carries a sense of liberation, yet individuals are compelled to cope with a fragmented and pluralised social order largely by themselves. While the advance of individual freedoms is taken-for-granted, the seemingly unnoticed structural imposition to individually negotiate the boundaries between systemic and normative processes is portrayed as individual freedom and social integration. This thesis explores the ambiguities underpinning individualisation as they emerge from contemporary transformations of capitalism and work.  As a result of a hyper-differentiated late modern social order the interface between functional and normative processes shifts from an institutional and organisational level to an individual one. Individualisation can no longer sufficiently be described as 'institutionalised individualism', either in respect to the realisation of a rather consistent normative infrastructure, or as mere individual responses to systemic dependencies. I argue that under the contemporary conditions of marketisation individuals increasingly become the focal point for the negotiation of systemic and normative processes. Substantiated by the theoretical argument of 'corporatisation' and the analysis of interviews with managers from international corporations, I contend that various workorganisational developments transform the subtle pressures to individually negotiate the demarcations between systems and lifeworld into an organising principle. I describe the emerging ambiguities with which individuals struggle, in particular at the workplace, as 'organised individualisation'. Individuals become 'active hubs' not only for the coordination but also for the reproduction of their own systemic dependencies which are organisationally pre-defined.  While the responsibility to pseudo-negotiate systemic processes is put on individuals, the lack of opportunities to publicly debate and contest society's normative underpinnings generates deficiencies in social integration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Individualism.</field><field name="subject">Social values.</field><field name="subject">Social integration.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flute acoustics: measurement, modelling and design</field><field name="creator">Dickens, Paul, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A well-made flute is always a compromise and the job of flute makers is to achieve a musically and aesthetically satisfying compromise; a task that involves much trial and-error. The practical aim of this thesis is to develop a mathematical model of the flute and a computer program that assists in the flute design process. Many musical qualities of a woodwind instrument may be calculated from the acoustic impedance spectrum of the instrument. A technique for fast and accurate measurement of this quantity is developed. The technique is based on the multiple-microphone technique, and uses resonance-free impedance loads to calibrate the system and spectral shaping to improve the precision at impedance extrema. The impedance spectra of the flute and clarinet are measured over a wide range of fingerings, yielding a comprehensive and accurate database. The impedance properties of single finger holes are measured using a related technique, and fitformulae are derived for the length corrections of closed finger holes for a typical range of hole sizes and lengths. The bore surface of wooden instruments can change over time with playing and this can affect the acoustic impedance, and therefore the playing quality. Such changes in acoustic impedance are explored using wooden test pipes. To account for the effect of a typical player on flute tuning, an empirical correction is determined from the measured tuning of both modern and classical flutes as played by several professional and semi-professional players. By combining the measured impedance database with the player effects and various results in the literature a mathematical model of the input impedance of flutes is developed and implemented in command-line programs written in the software language C. A user-friendly graphical interface is created using the flute impedance model for the purposes of flute acoustical design and analysis. The program calculates the tuning and other acoustical properties for any given geometry. The program is applied to a modern flute and a classical flute. The capabilities and limitations of the software are thereby illustrated and possible contributions of the program to contemporary flute design are explored.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustical engineering.</field><field name="subject">Music -- Acoustics and physics.</field><field name="subject">Flute -- Construction.</field><field name="subject">Woodwind instruments -- Acoustics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software radio global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver front-end design: sampling and jitter considerations</field><field name="creator">Amin, Bilal, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the sampling and jitter specifications and considerations for Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) software receivers. Software Radio (SWR) technologies are being used in the implementation of communication receivers in general and GNSS receivers in particular. With the advent of new GPS signals, and a range of new Galileo and GLONASS signals soon becoming available, GNSS is an application where SWR and software-defined radio (SDR) are likely to have an impact. The sampling process is critical for SWR receivers where it occurs as close to the antenna as possible. One way to achieve this is by BandPass Sampling (BPS), which is an undersampling technique that exploits aliasing to perform downconversion. In this thesis, the allowable sampling frequencies are calculated and analyzed for the multiple frequency BPS software radio GNSS receivers. The SNR degradation due to jitter is calculated and the required jitter standard deviation allowable for wach GNSS band of interest is evaluated and a basic jitter budget is calculated that could assist in the design of multiple frequency SWR GNSS receivers. Analysis shows that psec-level jitter specifications are required in order to keep jitter noise well below the thermal noise for software radio satellite navigation receivers. However, analysis of a BPSK system shows that large errors occur if the jittered sample crosses a data bit boundary. However, the signal processing techniques required to process the BOC modulation are much more challenging than those for traditional BPSK. BOC and AltBOC have more transitions per chip of spreading code and hence jitter creates greater SNR degradation. This work derives expressions for noise due to jitter taking into account the transition probability in QPSK, BOC, AltBOC systems. Both simulations and analysis are used to give a better understanding of jitter effects on Software Radio GNSS receivers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="subject">Software radio.</field><field name="subject">Digital communications.</field><field name="subject">Sampling -- Software.</field><field name="subject">Digital electronics -- Testing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transplantation of fetal pig islet-like cell clusters as therapy for diabetes</field><field name="creator">Dean, Sophia Katrina, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fetal pig islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) were transplanted into the thymus or omentum of STZ-induced diabetic pigs immunosuppressed with cyclosporine (CsA) and deoxyspergualin (DSG), as a potential treatment for type 1 diabetes. C-peptide levels in response to glucagon and arginine significantly increased over time using 1 litter of ICCs with highest levels obtained at 100 days post-transplantation. Increasing the number of ICCs to 2 litters was not advantageous. Histology of the graft showed all 4 pancreatic endocrine cells. Normoglycaemia was achieved for transient periods without insulin administration in 4 out of 12 pigs. These results suggest sub-optimal insulin production, possibly due to the adverse effects of CsA on the grafted &#946; cells. The effect of CsA on adult porcine &#946; cells was investigated and adverse effects were shown. Renal toxicity and adverse changes to the haematological parameters did not occur despite high CsA levels although minimal toxicity to the liver was observed. The results indicate that the use of CsA monotherapy in the maintenance phase to prevent rejection of allografted pancreatic &#946; cells may become a subsequent problem over time. As an alternative to chronic immunossuppression, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody was administered for 10 days in pigs. Using anti-CD3 alone, only 1 out 4 pigs showed cells positive for insulin. The addition of a 5-day CsA course administered the day before transplantation did not promote allograft survival. The use of DSG for 10 days with anti-CD3 promoted graft survival with the histology showing the 4 endocrine cells 3 weeks post-transplantation. An attempt was made to replace any form of immunossuppression by encapsulating fetal pig ICCs in barium alginate, which were able to remain viable when transplanted in NOD/SCID mice. Fibrosis was detected in BALB/c mice transplanted with encapsulated fetal ICCs suggesting that fetal pig ICCs shed antigens that elicit an immune response. Results from this study show that although fetal pig ICCs may be a viable source of insulin-producing cells, the use of CsA to prevent rejection has adverse effects on graft function. Encapsulation as well as transient immunosuppression is worthy of further investigation to prevent rejection of fetal pig ICCs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Insulin.</field><field name="subject">Islands of Langerhans -- Transplantation.</field><field name="subject">Swine -- Fetuses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cranial variation of contemporary East Asians in a global context</field><field name="creator">Green, Hayley, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current study examines cranial variation of contemporary East Asians with an aim to comprehensively describe and define the morphology of people in this region. In doing so, a better understanding of the causes of variation within East Asia and compared to other geographic populations is sought. The study encompasses a broad range of samples from Northeast Asia to island Southeast Asia. Traditional linear and angular data and analytical methods (e.g Box and Whisker, Principal Components Analysis) were used to assess cranial variation. Thus the results may be compared to published studies using traditional craniometric approaches. Innovative geometric morphometric data collection and analysis techniques are also used here for the first time. Results show East Asians are distinguishable from non-Asians on the basis of their tall, round, vault, shorter cranial length, tall faces that are flattened in the upper and mid-facial regions, short malars (anteroposterior length), narrow interorbital breadth and orthognathism. A north-south East Asian cline was also detected, with the northern samples exhibiting tall, orthognathic faces, and a long low vault. This long, low vault shape is in contradiction to the purported shape of cold-climate adapted populations. Southern East Asians possess a tall, rounded vault and a short, projecting (prognathic) face. Island Southeast Asians inhabiting the Andaman and Nicobar Islands exhibit a 'mixed' morphology, possessing the southern East Asian facial form, but the long, low vault seen in northern East Asian samples. The long, low vault also characterises non-Asian samples from Australia, Africa and Melanesia. Shape differences were significantly associated with latitude, explaining most of the variation. The identification of ancestral East Asian features in recent samples suggests phylogenetics may also be contributing to variation in part. The study concludes that there is clear evidence for geographical variation among modern East Asians, some if it being continuous (clinal) and some discontinuous. Importantly, much of the variation reflects adaptation to climate, with a phylogenetic component also recognised. The study contributes to our understanding of human evolution in a region that today constitutes around half of the world?s population.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Craniology -- East Asia.</field><field name="subject">Anatomy, Comparative.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic evaluation of environmental impacts of industrial products</field><field name="creator">Manmek, Suphunnika, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Environmental costs of products are closely related to their environmental impacts incurred at all life cycle stages of a product. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods are often used to estimate these environmental costs and impacts. However, LCA analysis is known to be a costly and time-consuming method, whereas LCC analysis often neglects the social cost which is currently paid by society as a whole. Therefore, this research proposes a new methodology to assess the environmental impact and social cost for the entire life cycle of a product, which can be used as a simple and transparent tool for the early conceptual design stage. The methodology delivers the Environmental Impact Drivers and the associated Social Cost Drivers for all product life cycle stages via spreadsheets, and it provides the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method in the SimaPro software as a user interface. Furthermore, the drivers provide the values for four different geographical regions and damage categories. The conceptual model is based on the impact pathway approach which integrates the Simplified LCA (SLCA) model and the social cost databases. The SLCA model is derived from an extension of previous research whereas the social costs are based on the most suitable Economic Valuation (EV) studies such as the EPS2000d, EXMOD, Ecosense and Asian EV studies. The data collection for the SLCA database was accomplished by using the LCA analysis of the Eco Indicator 99 H/A method and the Hierarchical clustering technique. The data for the social cost database was collected using the Benefit Transfer Method which obtains the EV studies mainly from the Environmental Valuation Reference Inventory (EVRI) data source. Several case studies utilising existing products, including a product redesign case study were used to prove the concept and demonstrate the efficiency of this proposed methodology.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial ecology -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Environmental impact analysis.</field><field name="subject">Product life cycle -- Environmental aspects.</field><field name="subject">Product management.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of designers' cultural preferences on product concepts</field><field name="creator">Razzaghi, Mohammad, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Products are designed to satisfy user needs. Thus, industrial designers are expected to have a thorough understanding of user needs and to incorporate those understandings into the design of products; however, it is not a straightforward task for designers to translate their conditional understanding into a product. The gap between product and user can be even wider when latent user needs, such as cultural ones, are calculated into the problem. Therefore the meanings and functions imbued in products by the designer may not be recognized and acknowledged by users, due to the differences in cultural preferences of designers and users from separate cultures. In spite of the fact that user satisfaction has been extensively supported in the design literature, it seems that such an approach allows only a passive role for designers, who actually act as cultural intermediaries; that is, the designers' role is merely presumed to catalyze the process and match user requirements to the end product. Thus, the impact of designers' cultural preferences is considered as incidental, or at least overlooked. A content analysis method was triangulated to collect and analyze diverse visual and textual data relating to the concept generation stage of the product development process. To collect data, professional industrial designers in the two culturally diverse countries of Australia and Iran were recruited to participate in half-hour design exercise sessions to sketch to a design brief, followed by responding to an interview questionnaire. The analysis of data revealed that: (1) designers' cultural preferences do influence their approaches toward tackling the design problem; (2) there are nexuses between the design aspects of the concepts generated and the cultural dimensions of the values of the societies in which the designers were born and has lived, and; (3)potential users can unconsciously comprehend the meaning invested in the product by the designer. This thesis breaks new ground for further advancing the study of the Designer-Precedent Approach (DPA) in other cultural and social contexts, while it challenges the conventional approaches of user-centered design (UCD) broadlyperceived as the ultimate method of incorporating users' wants into products.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Industrial designers -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Creative ability in technology -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the intertrial interval in the loss of context conditioned fear responses.</field><field name="creator">Li, Sophie Huk Lahn, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Eight experiments examined the role of the intertrial interval in the extinction of conditioned fear to a context. Rats were shocked in one context (A) but not in another (B) and freezing responses to Context A were extinguished. The interval between extinction trials was spent in the home cages. Experiments 1a and 1b showed that massed extinction trials produced better response loss but worse learning than spaced trials. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the interval between the final extinction trial and test mediated the level of responding on a test exposure. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that the duration of the extinction trial affected long term response loss, whereby long durations facilitate response loss compared to shorter durations. Subsequent experiments (Experiments 5 to 8) demonstrated that the first in the series of massed extinction trials reduced the associability of subsequent trials. Associability was restored by alternating extinction trials between Context A and Context B. The results are discussed in terms of the role accorded to self-generated priming in the models developed by A. R.

It also presents a novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals as an alternative to the cycle counting methods.  Current durability testing of automatic transmission output shafts uses 50 000 stall torque cycles from zero to wide open throttle. In the majority of cases, these requirements lead to an over design that can result in an unnecessarily bulky transmission system. As a solution to this problem a novel methodology for evaluation of loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions was developed. The methodology is based on real world loading conditions and therefore leads to a more realistic estimation of the fatigue life of shafts. The methodology can be used as a tool for shaft optimisation in different drive conditions. Using the developed methodology the effects of different road conditions on the fatigue life of a transmission output shaft were compared. Four routes having differing driving conditions were investigated and of those routes, the route with most stop-start events resulted in the greatest reduction in fatigue life.  A novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals was also developed. The methodology is based on knowledge of the bandwidth and dynamic range of the expected in-service load signal. This novel methodology allows significant reduction of the volume of data to be acquired. It preserves the time sequence of peaks and valleys of the signal, which is vital in the case of fatigue analysis. This is in contrast to current methods based on cycle counting. Cycle counting methods achieve high data reduction but do not preserve the time sequence of the signal. The developed novel methodology has been validated on the newly developed data acquisition system capable of real time data acquisition and compression of shaft torque signal. The performed tests show that the proposed one-channel low cost system equipped with 1 GB compact flash card can store well over 10 000 hrs of load history.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shafting -- Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Shafting -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Automobiles -- Transmission devices, Automatic -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Metals -- Fatigue</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of international corporate finance:  initial public offerings (IPOs); American depositary receipts (ADRs); and stock analysts? recommendations</field><field name="creator">Ng, David, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of empirical studies on various aspects of international corporate finance, a series of long-run event studies examining the abnormal stock return performance of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), and stock analyst recommendations. The first two of these, presented in Chapters 2 and 3, investigate the key issues relating to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs). The next, in Chapter 4, examines the performance of new American Depositary Receipt issues from emerging markets and its determinants. The final study, presented in Chapter 5, assesses the value of stock analysts? recommendations in emerging markets. It is essentially a series of empirical studies adopting a tried and tested methodology, involving benchmarks, for measuring returns over time in emerging markets, a subject that has not been sufficiently investigated. The long-run event study approach is designed to identify anomalies in these markets, which may be much more pronounced than in developed markets. This thesis makes substantive contributions to the existing knowledge on measuring, documenting and determining various issues in international corporate finance, and provides methodological improvements over previous studies. Chapter 2 presents an examination of the stock return performance of the IPO stocks listed on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) in Hong Kong, finding that the return performance is sensitive to the benchmark employed. Two main factors contributing to the underperformance of GEM stocks are the ?technology boom? and ?IPO effects?. Moreover, the results of cross-sectional analyses suggest that the Hong Kong GEM is a unique market; since at least 70 percent of the IPO stocks listed on the GEM are technology stocks, the ?technology? factor outweighs previous hypotheses advocated by previous researchers to explain the poor performance of newly listed stocks. Chapter 3 extends this analysis by turning attention to the post-issue stock price performance of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in Asian markets, using a comparative assessment of the stock performance of Asian IPOs motivated by the ongoing discovery of biases in event studies involving long horizon returns. Various methods were used to remove such biases, while examining the robustness of the long run performance of the IPOs. The results of this examination show that the existence of long run underperformance for the Asian IPOs depends on the methodology used. The study also assesses the ?Market Timing? theory with regard to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), adding to the growing literature that suggests that Asian firms time their issuance of equity securities. Chapter 4 presents a comparative study of the post-issue stock performance and operating performance of the Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) of American Depositary Receipts (ADR) in emerging markets. The results of this study suggest that ADR IPOs are underpriced, though not to the same extent as regular IPOs. In the aftermarket, ADR IPOs underperform the Emerging Market Index. However, after controlling for differences in size and industry, underperformance of ADR IPOs compared with both home market IPOs and US IPOs could not be demonstrated. The analysis of stock and operating performance yields consistent results; aside from the ?window dressing? effect, this also demonstrates that stock price performance is a reflection of operating performance over the long run. Chapter 5 presents the first study to examine post-recommendation abnormal returns in emerging markets, based on the Emerging Market Index adjusted model and the Controlling Firm approach, demonstrating that stock prices react significantly to recommendation revisions, both on the revision day and subsequently. In this cross-sectional analysis, it appears that the Market-to-Book ratio is the primary indicator for Buy and Strong Buy recommendations. This indicates that stock analysts in emerging markets prefer high growth stocks with their attractive characteristics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Finance.</field><field name="subject">Stocks -- Rate of return.</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis.</field><field name="subject">Going public (Securities)</field><field name="subject">American depositary receipts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nothing personal</field><field name="creator">Chaitow, Tanya, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The autobiographical nature of my work deals with the space between the innocence of childhood and the wisdom of adulthood. I explore the complexities of personal experience, old and new landscapes and the scar tissue of memory. The work deals with beginnings and departures, relationships and conflict of power and vulnerability in the quest to make sense of life. My work connects with moments of childhood that I try to retain as a touchstone for authentic experience. The images are derived from personal and familial experiences, moving through to the universal to tell the human tale, using the human body as a metaphor. The body becomes the subject matter for expressing ideas about our universal and personal concerns. I explore the gulf between the real and the unreal through examining themes such as identity, vulnerability, anxiety, fear, alienation, abandonment, loss, corruption of innocence, love and death within a contemporary urban framework. These emotions are played out against the backdrop of daily domesticity and reflect the physical reality of the world around us, often exposing the contrast between the orderly veneer of our daily lives and our emotional reality. My work methodology uses narrative found in books, films, fairy tales or fables to explore the conflicting emotions which structure human identity and interaction. I use the stories as a way of approaching ideas or emotions and exploiting the story as a focus of cultural knowledge. In the search for emotional truth I draw parallels between my art practice and the search for authenticity within the theatre.  My work is an attempt to explain my own creative process in relation to the artists who have influenced me, my childhood, its rich tradition of storytelling and my passion for theatre and literature as well as a search for meaning in my own relationships and life's journey. This is conveyed through a series of paintings and works on paper.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creation (Literary, artistic, etc.) -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Artists -- Psychology.</field><field name="subject">Symbolism in art.</field><field name="subject">Art and mythology.</field><field name="subject">Figurative painting, Australian.</field><field name="subject">Chaitow, Tanya -- Symbolism.</field><field name="subject">Chaitow, Tanya -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding creativity through memes and schemata</field><field name="creator">Hawthorne, Julie, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">When it comes to the notion of creativity, both R. Dawkins and D. Dennett argue that creativity is a matter of random mutation, in the same way that genes randomly mutate. Neither Dennett nor Dawkins see anything else in the mimetic theory of creativity than a process of Darwinian evolution. However, this complete reliance upon the extension of evolution for understanding creativity needs to be supplemented by combining it with other ideas such as those of "schema theory," because creativity always occurs within a structured context and is not simply a matter of random mutation of ideas. Schema theory comes largely from the works of E.H Gombrich, who argued that "schemas" play a crucial role in how it is that we are able to be creative. He defines schemas as structure and traditions in society that help to convey the meaning of our creative efforts. Just as semantics needs syntax within language in order to formulate and convey meaning, so by analogy memes need schemas for the creation and expression of new ideas. Rather than being the antithesis of creativity, existing forms of expression and traditions are important for the creation of new ideas. This needs to be factored into any theory of creativity in order to account for the effect of the social context on creative endeavours in addition to a Darwinian account of memes. The unconscious processes at work within the brain that are involved in the generation of ideas and other creative products can be understood using the notion of a "generator", as originally conceived by D. Dennett. This notion goes beyond mere concrete Skinnerian behavioural trial and error. Within this generator, there appear to be at work processes such as those of bisociation and association, as discussed by A. Koestler, as well as processes such as the role of language, memory, generate-and-test and intentionality that must be acknowledged in addition to the syntactic operations of schemas and the replicating contents of memes. The operation of all of these ingredients within the generator, when understood together, can be seen as responsible for our ability to be creative.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative ability.</field><field name="subject">Memetics.</field><field name="subject">Schematism (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gustatory effects of dietary fat</field><field name="creator">Song, Hae-Jin, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates whether fats, akin to other taste stimuli, exhibit sensory properties such as mixture interactions. In order to determine gustatory, rather than tactile or olfactory effects, viscosity-controlled emulsions of deodorised oils were used as the base to which taste stimuli were incorporated and presented to a panel of trained assessors.  In preliminary qualitative assessments, panellists described the 10% olive oil emulsion as saltier, stronger, fattier and having a more lingering aftertaste than the non-oil control, suggesting that oil modulates taste duration as well influencing taste intensity and/or perceived quality. Panellists were unable to rate the oil/fat taste per se with any degree of certainty hence further experiments examined the effect of oil on the perception of taste mixtures. In mixture interaction experiments, the addition of oil did not result in mixture suppression or enhancement for sweet, salty, sour or bitter while it significantly enhanced umami. To determine the locus of interaction, when MSG and oil were presented to each side of the tongue separately, the enhancement effect disappeared indicating a peripheral mechanism of interaction, similar to the attenuation of chilli burn by oil. In contrast, suprathreshold sucrose sweetness was enhanced by the contralateral presentation of oil, indicating sensory processing at a higher locus. Furthermore, the addition of oil significantly reduced bitterness in a caffeine-MSG mixture. Since earlier experiments did not indicate any interaction between oil and bitterness, the decrease in the perceived bitterness of this binary mixture is attributed to an increase in umami which is likely to have suppressed bitterness, the perceptually dominant component in this mixture. These findings suggest a gustatory role for fats in modulating the taste profile of mixtures, in particular, enhancing total taste intensity, prolonging taste duration, and enhancing umami. A taste receptor-based model of fat perception provides for an orosensory mechanism capable of signalling the arrival of the most energy-dense nutrient, essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. The chemosensory signal may also be the basis for hedonic responses with subsequent implications for intake.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Low-fat diet</field><field name="subject">Oils and fats, Edible</field><field name="subject">Taste</field><field name="subject">Chemoreceptors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performative architecture: design strategies for living bodies</field><field name="creator">Spurr, Sam, School of English, Media &amp; Performance Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under the title 'Performative Architecture', this thesis draws on theories from performance studies and phenomenology in order to look beyond humanist practices that see the body as fixed and static. This thesis addresses two questions that I will be arguing are of increasing significance to contemporary architecture: Firstly, in the context of emerging digital and digitised spaces, how does the living body interact with the surrounding environment?; and secondly, what do these changing forms of human inhabitation and movement mean for the practice of architecture? The time frame spans from the work of Oskar Schlemmer in the 1920s to contemporary built works, examining the different ways that performativity has infiltrated architectural design. The case studies are divided into architectural performances that highlight the living body, and performative drawings that explore how to bring that body into the design process. In doing so a number of emerging paradigms become apparent that find built form in contemporary architectural examples. This approach is used to describe and analyse recent projects by Daniel Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, Diller and Scofidio and Lars Spuybroek, and to identify a common orientation through very different types of built environments. Acknowledging the change in both bodies and spaces in the Information Age, this research seeks to make room for the living body in the design of emerging, multidimensional, built environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architectural design.</field><field name="subject">Architecture -- Human factors.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tricky technology, troubled tribes: a video ethnographic study of the impact of information technology on health care professionals??? practices and relationships.</field><field name="creator">Forsyth, Rowena, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Whilst technology use has always been a part of the practice of health care delivery, more recently, information technology has been applied to aspects of clinical work concerned with documentation. This thesis presents an analysis of the ways that two professional groups, one clinical and one ancillary, at a single hospital cooperatively engage in a work practice that has recently been computerised. It investigates the way that a clinical group???s approach to and actual use of the system creates problems for the ancillary group. It understands these problems to arise from the contrasting ways that the groups position their use of documentation technology in their local definitions of professional status. The data on which analysis of these practices is based includes 16 hours of video recordings of the work practices of the two groups as they engage with the technology in their local work settings as well as video recordings of a reflexive viewing session conducted with participants from the ancillary group. Also included in the analysis are observational field notes, interviews and documentary analysis. The analysis aimed to produce a set of themes grounded in the specifics of the data, and drew on TLSTranscription?? software for the management and classification of video data. This thesis seeks to contribute to three research fields: health informatics, sociology of professions and social science research methodology. In terms of health informatics, this thesis argues for the necessity for health care information technology design to understand and incorporate the work practices of all professional groups who will be involved in using the technology system or whose work will be affected by its introduction. In terms of the sociology of professions, this thesis finds doctors and scientists to belong to two distinct occupational communities that each utilise documentation technology to different extents in their displays of professional competence. Thirdly, in terms of social science research methodology, this thesis speculates about the possibility for viewing the engagement of the groups with the research process as indicative of their reactions to future sources of outside perturbance to their work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospitals -- Medical staff -- Professional relationships -- Australia -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Interprofessional relations -- Australia -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Medical records -- Australia -- Data processing -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Medical records -- Australia -- Data processing -- Case studies</field><field name="subject">Diagnosis, Laboratory -- Information technology -- Australia -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Professions -- Australia -- Sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">Medical informatics -- Australia -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Health services administration -- Information technology -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Health services administration -- Information technology -- Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cosmology with Quasar Absorption Lines</field><field name="creator">Crighton, Neil, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we make a new measurement of the primordial deuterium abundance, and analyse five other systems selected as possible D/H candidates.  We also undertake an investigation of systematic errors in a system where an existing deuterium measurement has been made. We measure the number of hydrogen components and their velocity distributions in a moderate and high redshift sample of Lyman limit systems in one Angstrom resolution spectra.  We present a new measurement of the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio, D/H, at z=3.2560 in a newly-discovered low metallicity absorption system towards the quasar PG1937-1009.  We attempt to account for any systematic effects that could influence the D/H measurement.  We find a 1 sigma range for D/H*1e5 of 1.6 (+0.25) (-0.30).  Using high resolution spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, we assess the suitability of five D/H candidate absorption systems.  These systems were selected as candidates using lower resolution spectra.  We measure the neutral hydrogen column density, identify metal lines and analyse the velocity structure of each system, and show them to be unsuitable for measuring D/H. We also investigate the systematic errors in the absorber at z=0.701 towards quasar PG1718-4801 that was initially thought to show a high primordial D/H value. We analyse the dependence of the putative deuterium line's parameters on wavelength calibration errors in the HST spectra and present a revised deuterium measurement.  We examine the velocity widths of two samples of one Angstrom resolution quasar spectra showing Lyman limit absorption systems.  The first sample is at high redshifts, taken from the Sloan quasar data release 3 catalogue.  The second is at intermediate redshifts, compiled from a survey for UV quasar absorption systems taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. We use a modified version of the Voigt profile fitting program, VPFIT, to estimate the number of hydrogen velocity components and column density in the Lyman limit systems.  We compare the velocity distributions of the higher and lower redshift samples.  We find the distributions are consistent with other measures of the velocity spread in absorption systems, and find no compelling evidence for evolution between the redshift samples.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quasar absorption lines</field><field name="subject">deuterium abundance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genus category and cranial morphometrics of the Catarrhini with implications for fossil hominins</field><field name="creator">Coate, Jack Andrew, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recently, the number of hominin genera has increased dramatically. Prior to the announcement of Ardipithecus, only two genera were used by paleoanthropologists: Australopithecus and Homo. Presently, up to eight hominin genera are used: Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, Ardipithecus, Australopithecus, Praeanthropus, Kenyanthropus, Paranthropus and Homo. Unlike species concepts, the genus category has not received wide critical examination. To investigate the use of the genus category in paleoanthropology, a comparative framework drawing on morphometric data from a large number of catarrhines is developed. Cranial variables include 36 standard linear measurements from representatives of catarrhine genera across the major tribes/families. This study seeks to assess whether too few or too many hominin genera have been recognized compared with extant catarrhines. Moreover, two published hypotheses about the use of Homo are examined: 1) Wood &amp; Collard's (1999) proposal to transfer Homo habilis/rudolfensis to Australopithecus; and 2) Goodman et al's (1998) classification of both humans and chimpanzees in Homo. To analyze these cranial variables and a number of shape indices calculated from them, as well as to assess competing hypotheses, univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistical approaches are used.  The results allow the identification of a set of variables and shape indices which distinguish genera across the catarrhines. Importantly, body size seems to be the major separator of catarrhine genera, reinforcing the idea that they occupy discrete adaptive zones. Moreover, differences between these genera mostly represent contrasts in the size of the neuroversus the viscerocranium. When applied to hominins, a picture emerges which distinguishes them from extant catarrhines: cranial shape rather than size is the major component distinguishing them; this suggests that extinct hominins occupied similar habitats and adaptive zones; variability in size and shape within hominin genera is much lower than extant catarrhines; and the major differences seen in shape among hominins are the result of encephalization in Homo. It is concluded here that both Wood &amp; Collard's (1999) and Goodman et al.'s (1998) proposals appear to be premature. Moreover, while the earliest hominins may be too finely split at the genus level, the evidence for distinction of Australopithecus and Paranthropus is solid.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fossil hominids.</field><field name="subject">Fossil hominids -- Carniology.</field><field name="subject">Paleoanthropology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eidolon: adapting distributed applications to their environment.</field><field name="creator">Potts, Daniel Paul, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Grids,  multi-clusters, NUMA  systems, and  ad-hoc collections  of distributed computing  devices  all  present  diverse environments  in  which  distributed computing applications can be run.   Due to the diversity of features provided by these environments  a distributed application that is  to perform well must be  specifically designed and  optimised for  the environment  in which  it is deployed.  Such optimisations generally affect the application's communication structure, its consistency protocols, and its communication protocols.  This  thesis  explores approaches  to  improving  the  ability of  distributed applications  to   share  consistent   data  efficiently  and   with  improved functionality over wide-area and diverse environments.  We identify a fundamental separation of concerns for distributed applications. This is used to propose a new  model, called the view model, which is a hybrid,  cost-conscious approach  to  remote data  sharing.   It provides  the necessary  mechanisms  and  interconnects   to  improve  the  flexibility  and functionality  of data  sharing  without defining  new  programming models  or protocols.  We employ the  view model to adapt distributed  applications to their run-time environment without modifying the  application or inventing new consistency or communication protocols. We explore the use of view  model properties on several programming models and their consistency  protocols.  In particular,  we focus on  programming models used in  distributed-shared-memory middleware  and applications, as  these can benefit significantly from the properties of the view model.  Our evaluation demonstrates the benefits, side effects and potential short-comings of the view model by comparing our model with traditional models when running distributed applications across several multi-clusters scenarios. In particular, we show that the view model improves the performance of distributed applications while reducing resource usage and communication overheads.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grids</field><field name="subject">Distributed computing</field><field name="subject">DSM</field><field name="subject">Distributed shared memory</field><field name="subject">MPI</field><field name="subject">View model</field><field name="subject">Distributed applications</field><field name="subject">Electronic data processing -- Distributed processing</field><field name="subject">Distributed operating systems (Computers)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RPX ??? a system for extending the IPv4 address range</field><field name="creator">Rattananon, Sanchai, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent times, the imminent lack of public IPv4 addresses has attracted the attention of both the research community and industry. The cellular industry has decided to combat this problem by using IPv6 for all new terminals. However, the success of 3G network deployment will depend on the services offered to end users. Currently, almost all services reside in the IPv4 address space, making them inaccessible to users in IPv6 networks. Thus, an intermediate translation mechanism is required. Previous studies on network address translation methods have shown that Realm Base Kluge Address Heuristic-IP, REBEKAH-IP supports all types of services that can be offered to IPv6 hosts from the public IPv4 based Internet, and provides excellent scalability. However, the method suffers from an ambiguity problem which may lead to call blocking. This thesis presents an improvement to REBEKAH-IP scheme in which the side effect is removed, creating a robust and fully scalable system. The improvement can be divided into two major tasks including a full investigation on the scalability of addressing and improvements to the REBEKAH-IP scheme that allow it to support important features such as ICMP and IP mobility. To address the first task a method called REBEKAH-IP with Port Extension (RPX) is introduced. RPX is extended from the original REBEKAH-IP scheme to incorporate centralised management of both IP address and port numbers. This method overcomes the ambiguity problem, and improves scalability. We propose a priority queue algorithm to further increase scalability. Finally, we present extensive simulation results on the practical scalability of RPX with different traffic compositions, to provide a guideline of the expected scalability in large-scale networks. The second task concerns enabling IP based communication. Firstly, we propose an ICMP translation mechanism which allows the RPX server to support important end-toend control functions. Secondly, we extend the RPX scheme with a mobility support scheme based on Mobile IP. In addition, we have augmented Mobile IP with a new tunneling mechanism called IP-in-FQDN tunneling. The mechanism allows for unique mapping despite the sharing of IP addresses while maintaining the scalability of RPX. We examine the viability of our design through our experimental implementation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet addresses</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Internetworking (Telecommunication)</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guanxi in Inter-firm relationship management in China.</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaobei, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The interaction of the personnel boundary in inter-firm relationship management is viewed as particularistic in China instead of universalistic as in many Western cultures. Specifically, guanxi networks, the Chinese system of inter-personal relationship, have strong strategic implications for business interactions. The practices of guanxi and the social norms associated with guanxi are complicated. On the one hand, guanxi practices can be traced back to Confucianism; on the other hand, guanxi???s significance has been changing in line with China???s economic reform. In this research, we have attempted to find what presently constitutes good guanxi in inter-firm relationship management against this dynamic backdrop. Additionally, from the transaction cost economies (TCE) perspective, we provide an analysis that guanxi-based business practices offer transaction cost advantages as an alternative to market-based practices. We argue that such advantages partially result from guanxi???s effect on the reduction of opportunist behaviors. Backed up by 97 questionnaire responses from firms in Shanghai and 15 semi-structured interviews, our study confirms that, in inter-firm relationships management, trust, affection and long-term orientation are features of close guanxi. To enhance guanxi quality, familiarization by self-disclosure and the presence of mutual benefits are also necessary, providing practical implications for business practitioners in China. Our study also indicates that guanxi business partners are expected to be obligational in business and flexible in contingencies. Opportunistic behaviors can be mitigated by adopting guanxi practices, supporting the TCE logic. In an absence of a rationalized legal system, guanxi may fill the gaps in the enforcement of the written contract.N</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business networks -- China</field><field name="subject">Interorganizational relations -- China</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relations -- China</field><field name="subject">Corporate culture -- China</field><field name="subject">Industrial sociology -- China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stroke risk factors, outcomes and models of stroke care in a culturally and linguistically Diverse (CALD) elderly population.</field><field name="creator">Shen, Qing, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. The majority of stroke patients are elderly. Advanced age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, smoking and heavy alcohol drinking are the major risk factors. Treatment of modifiable risk factors is an important strategy for primary and secondary stroke prevention.  The primary aim of this thesis was to examine stroke risk factor profile, risk factor management and clinical outcomes, as well as their association with ethnicity (defined as English-speaking background ? ESB, and non-English-speaking background - NESB) in a group of elderly patients from a multiethnic background.  Stroke risk factor profile and outcomes of stroke were similar between English and non-English-speaking background patients. However, a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the NESB patient group was observed in the study (41% vs. 10% in the ESB patient group) (Chapter 2). In addition, predictive factors and predictive models for stroke outcomes were developed. Advanced age, visual field loss and stroke type were the main predictors for mortality and functional dependency at 12 months post-stroke (Chapter 3). Delirium occurred in one quarter of the elderly patient post-stroke and was also associated with a worse clinical outcome (Chapter 4).  Risk factor management may be suboptimal in elderly patients. For example, anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation was underused, particularly in NESB patients (Chapter 2). The reasons for under-usage of anticoagulant therapy were investigated in a general practitioner survey (Chapter 6). Results showed that NESB, older age, cognitive impairment (especially living alone) were significant potential barriers for anticoagulant prescription by general practitioners. Stroke units have been proven to be a better care model for stroke patients, with shortened hospital length of stay and improved clinical outcomes. Clinical audits from Bankstown Combined (Co-located) Acute and Rehabilitation Stroke Unit and later the newly established Blacktown Combined Co-located Stroke Unit have demonstrated these benefits (Chapter 5). However, further studies need to be performed in order to determine whether a combined co-located stroke unit care model is superior to other stroke unit care models, and if so, the reasons behind this.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Patients -- Rehabilitation.</field><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Patients -- Care.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developmental trajectories into substance use in adolescence</field><field name="creator">McAloon, Thomas John, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal developmental characteristics of the association between mental health and substance use. N=1182 adolescents aged between 11 and 20 years were recruited from schools in Australia. Participants completed the Youth Self Report (YSR) (Achenbach, 1991a) and reported on their use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, their social ability, their motivation for using substances, their ability to regulate emotion, and the influences of their parents and peers on their substance use. N=561 of time one participants were retained for testing one year later to assess the potential to predict substance use at time two from mental health at time one. Results indicated a clear and consistent cross-sectional association between externalising scores on the YSR and use of the three substances, regardless of gender. The relation between internalising scores and substance use was non-significant. When the relation between externalising scores and substance use was assessed for mediation, only the influence of parents and peers was found to be significant. A cross-sectional structural model developed to account for this association was demonstrated to be invariant across the three substances of interest, and across gender, but not age category. There was no evidence that social skills, emotion regulation, or substance use motives, had roles in mediating the relationship between mental health and substance use. A model was developed to assess the potential to predict substance use at time two from externalising scores at time one. Results showed that externalising scores predicted increases in alcohol use via parent and peer attitudes. Thus, externalising disposition, in the context of a facilitative social environment, was predictive of an increase in alcohol use over time. Structural models developed to account for the predictive relation between externalising scores and use of cigarettes and marijuana  proved unstable and could not be tested. Substance use at time one was not predictive of externalising scores at time two. The results of the present research are discussed in relation to their potential to inform the developmental substance use literature, and efforts directed against the development of substance use problems. Limitations of the present research are noted.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Substance abuse -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Youth -- Drug use -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Drug abuse surveys -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular- and culturebased approaches to unraveling the chemical cross-talk between Delisea pulchra and Ruegeria strain R11</field><field name="creator">Case, Rebecca, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Delisea pulchra is a red macroalga that produces furanones, a class of secondary metabolites that inhibit the growth and colonization of a range of micro- and macroorganisms. In bacteria, furanones specifically inhibit acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)- driven quorum sensing, which is known to regulate a variety of colonization and virulence traits. This thesis aims to unveil multiple aspects of the chemically mediated interactions between an alga and its bacterial flora. It was demonstrated that the quorum sensing genetic machinery of bacteria is laterally transferred, making traditional 16S rRNA gene based-diversity techniques poorly suited to identify quorum sensing species. Previous studies had shown that AHL-producing bacteria belonging to the roseobacter clade can be readily isolated from D. pulchra. Because of this, it was decided to use a roseobacter epiphytic isolate from this alga, Ruegeria strain R11, to conduct a series of colonization experiments on furanone free and furanone producing D. pulchra. Furanones were shown to inhibit Ruegeria strain R11's colonization and infection of D. pulchra. In addition, it was demonstrated that Ruegeria strain R11 has temperature-regulated virulence, similar to what is seen for the coral pathogen Vibrio shiloi. Rising ocean temperatures may explain bleached D. pulchra specimens recently observed at Bare Island, Australia. To assess whether quorum sensing is common within the roseobacter clade, cultured isolates from the Roseobacter, Ruegeria and Roseovarius genera were screened for AHL production. Half of the bacteria screened produced the quorum sensing signal molecules, AHLs. These AHLs were identified using an overlay of an AHL reporter strain in conjunction with thin layer chromatography (TLC). The prevalence of quorum sensing within the roseobacter clade, suggests that these species may occupy marine niches where cellular density is high (such as surface associated communities on substratum and marine eukaryotes). Diversity studies in marine microbial communities require appropriate molecular markers. The 16S rRNA gene is the most commonly used marker for molecular microbial ecology studies. However, it has several limitations and shortcomings, to which attention has been drawn here. The rpoB gene is an alternate ???housekeeping??? gene used in molecular microbial ecology. Therefore, the phylogenetic properties of these two genes were compared. At most taxonomic levels the 16S rRNA and rpoB genes offer similar phylogenetic resolution. However, the 16S rRNA gene is unable to resolve relationships between strains at the subspecies level. This lack of resolving power is shown here to be a consequence of intragenomic heterogeneity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine chemical ecology</field><field name="subject">Marine metabolites</field><field name="subject">Delisea pulchra</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Cell interaction</field><field name="subject">Red algae</field><field name="subject">Bacteria -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Marine biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear behaviour of shallow concrete arches with  elastically restrained supports</field><field name="creator">Wang, Tao, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the effects of elastic restraint at the supports on the behaviour of shallow concrete arches, and the time-dependent effects of shrinkage and creep of concrete on the nonlinear behaviour of shallow arches.  The nonlinear behaviour of shallow circular arches with elastic rotational restraints at each support and subjected to a uniformly distributed radial load is firstly investigated. A virtual work formulation is used to establish both the nonlinear equilibrium equations and the buckling equilibrium equation for shallow arches. The analytical results show that the effects of the stiffness of the rotational restraints on the prebuckling and buckling response are significant.  An analytical model is developed for the in-plane elastic stability analysis of shallow parabolic arches with horizontal spring supports subjected to a uniformly distributed vertical load. A parametric study is undertaken using the proposed analytical model. It is found that the effects of the stiffness of the horizontal springs on the prebuckling response, buckling load and buckling behaviour of arches are significant.  An analytical model is developed to simulate the time-dependent behaviour of shallow concrete parabolic arches with horizontal spring supports subjected to a sustained loading, and in particular to investigate creep buckling. The time-dependent buckling load and the critical time (or age) of the arches are calculated by using an iterative process based on the proposed model. A systematic parametric study is undertaken, and the results show that the various parameters have a profound effect on the time-dependent buckling load and the prebuckling life of arches.  Both short-term and long-term experimental investigations of shallow parabolic tied concrete arches are described and used to validate the analytical models. For the short-term tests, three concrete arches were subjected to a uniformly distributed vertical load and were loaded to failure. For the long-term tests, seven concrete arches were subjected to sustained service loads. The instantaneous and time-dependent deflections were recorded throughout the period of loading, together with the distribution of the horizontal thrust at the supports. Comparisons between the experimental results and the analytical predictions using the analytical models are made to verify the accuracy of the theoretical models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arches.</field><field name="subject">Load factor design.</field><field name="subject">Buckling (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Concrete arches.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONCEPTUALISATION, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEDICAL EMERGENCY TEAM (MET) AS A SYSTEM OF MANAGEMENT TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR SERIOUSLY ILL PATIENTS.</field><field name="creator">Hillman, Ken, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis covers research around the Medical Emergency Team (MET) system, describing its development, evaluation and other related research that evolved as a result of the MET concept. The basic problem that prompted development of the MET system was related to the inadequate care given to the seriously ill in acute hospitals. This thesis contains background research on some of the reasons why a MET system may be useful, including the limited skills and knowledge of medical training and the sort of acute problems encountered in a hospital at night. Research then describes how the MET system works, including published data on when and how often the team is called, the type of patient the team is called to, the interventions performed by the team, and the outcome of patients on whom a MET was called. At the same time research was being performed around outcome indicators used to measure the effectiveness of the MET system, resulting in the use of cardiac arrests, deaths and unanticipated admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as common end-points for research in this area. Further research demonstrated that potentially preventable antecedents were common before serious illness The thesis then concentrates on how effective the MET system was in reducing death and serious adverse events. The first study compared a hospital where a MET system had been implemented to two control hospitals and found there was a reduction in admissions to the ICU but after adjustment, not for deaths and cardiac arrests. The second study used a cluster randomised methodology, enrolling 23 hospitals across Australia, comparing the three end-points described above. The study found no difference between both groups. It did highlight some interesting areas around the importance of effective implementation in determining the effectiveness of systems in health. Other publications have described the importance of developing effective ways of caring for the seriously ill outside traditional areas such as ICUs. The MET system, or variations on it, is now implemented in many hospitals in Australia and around the world and there have been two international MET conferences held in North America and international guidelines on the MET concept established.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine</field><field name="subject">Hospital patients -- Care</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units -- Organization and administration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zero return: Directions in sound and image.</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Nathan, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research project explores a direction in the formation of sound and image. In the creation of a series of 'moving paintings' I bring together pieces of moving image and sound using techniques derived from musique concr??te. I have coined the term 'moving painting'  to describe these sound/image objects that have grown out of an attention to the form, activity, rhythm and texture of sound and image. This project develops from an understanding that sound and image can be constructed on their own terms as opposed to being organised by specific plot devices. This text offers a context for the formation of these moving paintings and outlines the systems of construction that bring them forth from noise. Firstly, I identify sound and its emergence from noise. Secondly, I address the formation of sound into music within a community. And lastly, I use these ideas to form systems for organising visual imagery. In doing this, I present a series of audiovisual works in which sound and image are woven together to form moving paintings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multimedia (Art)</field><field name="subject">Avant-garde (Music)</field><field name="subject">Musique concrete.</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Time and art.</field><field name="subject">Sound in art.</field><field name="subject">Art and music.</field><field name="subject">Art and electronics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodegradation, surface rugosities and biofilm coverage of biopolymers</field><field name="creator">Woolnough, Catherine Anne, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The increasing concern for sustainability and progress of medical research has resulted in the emergence of a wide range of biopolymers. The biodegradability of these alternative biopolymers requires investigation prior to their application in environmental and medical systems. This Thesis describes biodegradation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (P(HB-co-HV)), poly(3- hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO), poly-DL-lactide (PDLL), poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PDLLG) and ethyl cellulose (EC). Polymers were buried in garden soil for in vivo biodegradation experiments and a mixed population of microbes from the soil were incubated in laboratory in vitro biodegradation experiments. In both systems the short chain length PHA???s degraded rapidly and the medium chain length PHAs and other biomaterials displayed either slow or negligible weight loss. PHB and P(HB-co-HV) copolymers degraded to T50 6.7 to 9.7 times faster in vitro than in vivo. After 380 days burial in soil PHO had lost 60 % of the original 20 mg weight, PDLL 28 % and PDLLG 35 %. Ethyl cellulose and polystyrene did not biodegrade, Polymer-microbe surface interactions were investigated. The faster degrading polymers PHB and P(HB-co-HV) attracted a higher coverage of biofilm than the slower degrading polymers PHO, PDLL and PDLLG for both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. The non-degradable polymers (EC and polystyrene) attracted no biofilm. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated a positive correlation between biofilm coverage and polymer weight loss. Additionally the rougher air sides of solvent cast films attracted more biofilm than the smoother dish sides. Polymer surface changes were quantified with microscopy. Surface roughness of PHB, P(HB-co-8HV) and PHO increased during biodegradation, primarily due to an increase in the waviness component for both in vitro and in vivo degradation. In vitro methods provided a rapid mechanism for protocol development and sufficiently predicted both surface roughness changes and biofilm-biodegradation relationships in vivo. PHB and P(HB-co-8HV) were blended with the biodegradable antifouling agent 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (DCOI or Sea Nine 211). DCOI leached slowly from the films into the soil delaying biodegradation of the films until a lower residual level of DCOI remained. Biofouling was reduced on PHA films containing DCOI.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biopolymers -- Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Biopolymers -- Biodegradation</field><field name="subject">Biodegradation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnostics, prognostics and fault simulation for rolling element bearings</field><field name="creator">Sawalhi, Nader, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Vibration signals generated from spalled elements in rolling element bearings (REBs) are investigated in this thesis.  A novel signal-processing algorithm to diagnose localized faults in rolling element bearings has been developed and tested on a variety of signals. The algorithm is based on Spectral Kurtosis (SK), which has special qualities for detecting REBs faults. The algorithm includes three steps. It starts by pre-whitening the signal's power spectral density using an autoregressive (AR) model. The impulses, which are contained in the residual of the AR model, are then enhanced using the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) technique, which effectively deconvolves the effect of the transmission path and clarifies the impulses. Finally the output of the MED filter is decomposed using complex Morlet wavelets and the SK is calculated to select the best filter for the envelope analysis. Results show the superiority of the developed algorithm and its effectiveness in extracting fault features from the raw vibration signal.  The problem of modelling the vibration signals from a spalled bearing in a gearbox environment is discussed. This problem has been addressed through the incorporation of a time varying, non-linear stiffness bearing model into a previously developed gear model. It has the new capacity of modeling localized faults and extended faults in the different components of the bearing. The simulated signals were found to have the same basic characteristics as measured signals, and moreover were found to have a characteristic seen in the measured signals, and also referred to in the literature, of double pulses corresponding to entry into and exit from a localized fault, which could be made more evident by the MED technique. The simulation model is useful for producing typical fault signals from gearboxes to test new diagnostic algorithms, and also prognostic algorithms.  The thesis provides two main tools (SK algorithm and the gear bearing simulation model), which could be effectively employed to develop a successful prognostic model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roller bearings.</field><field name="subject">Bearings (Machinery) -- Vibration -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Knowledge acquisition (Expert systems)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy-related CO2 emissions in the Indonesian manufacturing sector</field><field name="creator">Sitompul, Rislima Febriani, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is aimed at developing policies for energy efficiency by observing the past changes of energy use in Indonesia???s manufacturing sector over the period 1980???2000, and to investigate mitigation options for energy-related CO2 emissions in the sector. The first part of the study uses decomposition analysis to assess the effect of the changes in energy consumption and the level of CO2 emissions, while the second part investigates energy efficiency improvement strategies and the use of economic instruments to mitigate CO2 emissions in the manufacturing sector. Economic activity was the dominant factor in increasing energy consumption over the whole period of analysis, followed by the energy intensity effect and then the structural effect. The increase in aggregate energy intensity over the period 1980-2000 was mainly driven by the energy intensity effect. In turn, the technical effect was the dominant contributor to changes in energy intensity effect, with the fuel-mix effect being of lesser importance. Changes in CO2 emissions were dominated by economic activity and structural change. Sub-sectors that would benefit from fuel switching and energy efficiency improvements are the textile, paper, and non-metal sub-sectors. Three main options for reducing CO2 emissions from the manufacturing sector were considered: the imposition of a carbon tax, energy efficiency initiatives, and other mitigation measures. A carbon tax was found to reduce sectoral emissions from the direct use of oil, gas and coal, but increased the demand for electricity. At the practical level, energy efficiency improvements can be implemented by adopting energy efficient technologies that can reduce aggregate energy intensity up to 37.1 per cent from the base-year level, estimated after imposition of a carbon tax at $30 per tonne of carbon. A major priority for energy efficiency improvements was found to be in the textile and the paper and chemical sub-sectors. A mitigation measure such as the Clean Development Mechanisms could be encouraged in order to reduce projected emission levels. The preferred option would be the adoption of energy efficient technologies in the textile, chemical, paper and non-metal sub-sectors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy policy -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Energy consumption -- Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Atmosperic carbon dioxide -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Manufacturing industries -- Environmental aspects -- Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic evaluation of body-related words and images</field><field name="creator">Watts, Kaaren Jane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examined automatic evaluation of body-related stimuli in female undergraduates using an affective priming task. Automaticity was tested by varying the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) and valence congruence of the prime and target pairs. The prime to target interval (SOA) was either short or long, and the valence of the paired items was either the same (congruent) or different (incongruent). Automaticity was indicated by faster responses to congruent pairs than to incongruent pairs at the short SOA (parsimonious criterion) but not at the long SOA (classic criterion). Individual differences in thin internalisation, appearance schematicity, body dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint were assessed as potential moderators. Automatic evaluation of body-related images, but not words, was demonstrated in Study 1B and Study 1A, respectively. In Study 2A, automatic evaluation of nonbody-related words was obtained and this was extended to body-related words (Study 2B). In Study 3, automatic evaluation of normatively-selected body words was examined and body image schema activation was tested as a function of level of appearance schematicity. There was a trend toward automaticity and schematicity did not moderate schema activation. Overall, elevated body image concerns did not influence automatic evaluation in Studies 1A to 3 (with the exception of Study 1B). The role of extreme levels of appearance schematicity on automaticity and schema activation was examined in Studies 4A and 4B for normative and idiographic primes. Automatic evaluation was demonstrated in Study 4A and a trend was obtained in Study 4B. Schematicity did not moderate affective processing or schema activation. Automatic evaluation of body-related images was replicated in Study 5 but it was not moderated by prime strength or individual differences. Overall, the research suggests that most female undergraduates, irrespective of differences in body image concerns, automatically evaluate body-related stimuli.

Based on 6900 known deaths, and 1455 known non-deaths, sensitivity and specificity of the linkage was estimated to be 82% and 92% respectively. Mortality rates were compared by calendar period, pre-ART (&lt;1990), pre- and early-HAART (1990-1996) and late-HAART (1997-2003). Mortality following AIDS decreased from 590.2/1000 person years pre-ART to 77.4 during the late-HAART period. Mortality following HIV diagnosis prior to AIDS increased from 9.7 to 20.2/1000 person years. The total number living with diagnosed HIV infection in Australia was estimated to have increased from 7873 at the end of 1989 to 12828 in 2003. Risk factors for survival following HIV and AIDS diagnosis were assessed using Cox regression. Age &gt;40 years and certain HIV exposure results were associated with poorer survival following HIV. Predictors of poorer survival following AIDS were age &gt;40 years, females exposed to HIV through receipt of blood, CD4 count &lt;20 and certain AIDS illnesses. Parametric models of survival following HIV and AIDS diagnosis were assessed using likelihood based criteria. Goodness of fit was assessed by comparing observed with model predicted numbers of deaths. Weibull models were found to fit best to both survival following HIV and AIDS. Parametric survival models were used to project deaths after HIV and AIDS across three scenarios of HAART usage. Deaths following HIV were projected to remain low, but to increase from 223 in 2005 to 288, 292 and 282  in 2010  if the HAART usage remains stable at 2005 levels, increases to 70% of all people with diagnosed HIV by 2010 and decreases to 39% of all people with diagnosed HIV respectively. Deaths after AIDS diagnosis were projected to increase unless if HAART usage increases to 100% of AIDS diagnoses by 2010.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Mortality -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resistance, Regeneration and the Figuring of the 'New Jew': Ephraim Moses Lilien and 'Muscular Jewry'</field><field name="creator">Swarts, Lynne Michelle, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis embraces a cross-disciplinary approach to the examination of Jewish body culture, and integrates aspects of Jewish studies with new theories of gender and visual culture, thus contributing specifically to the field of Jewish body culture in relation to the visual arts. It demonstrates that at the fin de si??cle the Zionist artist, Ephraim Moses Lilien, integrated Nordau's concept of 'Muscular Jewry' and Buber's notion of a 'Jewish Cultural Renaissance' in order to figure the 'New Jew'. It establishes that Lilien's figuring of 'Muscular Jewry' as a visibly athletic, explicitly heterosexual, male body, bearing Jewish distinction, was developed as a crucial strategy to overcoming the twin dilemmas of Jewish alterity: antisemitism and assimilation. By proving that Lilien's art serves as a crucial model for both regenerating the Jewish male body and resisting antisemitic projections of decadence and degeneracy, this thesis expands upon current scholarship. It applies Margaret Olin's theory of ' visual redemption' to Lilien's figuring of the 'New Jew'  and Daniel Boyarin's articulation of Homi Bhaba's Post-Colonial theory of mimicry as imitation, inversion and resistance to determine how Lilien's images functioned as an art of resistance against the dominant Christian European culture. By demonstrating how Lilien drew upon the modern and rebellious Jugendstil to figure the 'New Jew' and produce a new, defiant and authentic Jewish visual culture, this thesis proves he transformed the image of the diaspora Jew into the New Hebrew or Israeli tsabar, forty years before it became part of Israeli identity. Nevertheless, this thesis also uncovers the double-binded predicament inherent to Lilien's quest; despite his attempt to use mimicry of the athleticised, hyper-masculine, genetically pure, normative body as a strategy to resist antisemitic rhetoric and invert its projection, the closest parallel to Lilien's figure of 'Muscular Jewry' remained this same image which became instrumental to eugenic campaigns across Europe, particularly in Nazi Germany. Ultimately what is exposed by this thesis is the illusion underpinning Lilien's figuring of the 'New Jew'; that the Christianised Eurocentric body culture, designed to eradicate decadence, degeneration and Semitism, could resolve the problematic struggle for a Jewish national identity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jews in art.</field><field name="subject">Jews -- Identity.</field><field name="subject">Art and religion.</field><field name="subject">Art and society.</field><field name="subject">Lilien, Ephraim Mose, 1874-1925.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implicit and explicit attitudes of health care workers and their injecting drug using clients with hepatitis C: is this related to treatment experiences?</field><field name="creator">Brener, Loren, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">People with hepatitis C (HCV) face stigma and discrimination because of the association of this disease with injecting drug use (IDU). Research has found that many instances of HCV-related discrimination occur in the health care sector. Health care workers' beliefs about their HCV positive clients are likely to influence how they relate to clients and their treatment delivery. This research assessed the implicit and explicit attitudes of both health care workers and their HCV positive injecting drug using (HCV+) clients toward each other and then established whether these affect the treatment experiences of health care workers and clients. The sample consisted of 60 health care workers (doctors and nurses), 120 HCV+ and 120 HCV- clients, recruited from the same treatment facility. Participants were given a series of attitude and treatment experiences measures to complete. Data illustrate that while health care workers' and HCV+ clients' explicit attitudes towards each other were positive, clients with HCV still rated their health care workers less highly and reported less satisfaction with their treatment than HCV- clients. Analyses also indicated that more conservative health care workers displayed greater prejudice toward their HCV+ clients because they believe that injecting drug use is controllable. This prejudice toward IDUs on the part of health care workers was associated with worry about the behaviour of IDU clients and this worry in turn predicted differences in treatment experiences reported by HCV+ and HCV- clients. These data support the contention that health care worker concerns, particularly those related to injecting drug use, underlie discriminatory treatment of people with HCV. Finally the research also addressed the impact of health care worker contact with HCV+ clients on their attitudes towards this group. Analysis revealed that while health care workers who have had more contact with people with HCV show more positive explicit attitudes, they also show less favourable implicit attitudes toward IDUs. This may reflect the difficulties and stresses associated in caring for IDUs and may provide insight into the hidden costs involved for health care workers working with a population that may be challenging and at times difficult to manage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Patients.</field><field name="subject">epatitis C -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Physician and patient.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of PYY in regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis</field><field name="creator">Boey, Dana, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Peptide YY (PYY) is a gut-derived hormone that is renowned for its effects on satiety. Reduced satiety in obese people has been attributed to low fasting and postprandial PYY levels. However, it has not been determined whether low PYY levels are the cause or the outcome of obesity. Moreover, the long-term role of PYY in regulating energy balance is unclear.  Results presented in this thesis, using PYY-deficient mice (PYY-/-) and PYY transgenic mice (PYYtg) highlight that PYY indeed has an important role in regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis in vivo. PYY knockout mice became obese with ageing or high-fat feeding linked to a hyperinsulinemic phenotype associated with hypersecretion of insulin from isolated pancreatic islets. These findings suggested that PYY deficiency may be a predisposing factor for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, PYYtg mice exhibited decreased adiposity and increased metabolism under high-fat feeding. Furthermore, PYYtg/ob mice had improved glucose tolerance and decreased adiposity. These latter studies suggested that high circulating PYY levels may protect against the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, both animal models support PYY as an important regulator of the somatotropic axis. These preliminary findings prompted investigations in understanding whether low PYY levels may be a predisposing factor for the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes in human subjects. In a population of healthy human subjects that had a predisposition to the development of type 2 diabetes and obesity, fasting PYY levels were lower than in normal subjects. Moreover, low fasting PYY levels strongly correlated with decreased insulin sensitivity and high levels of fasting insulin. Collectively, these findings suggest that low circulating levels of PYY could contribute to increased adiposity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Therefore determination of PYY levels may be a method of detecting whether people are predisposed to becoming obese and insulin resistant. This work also suggests that treatments that enhance circulating PYY levels may be protective in the development of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peptides -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Obesity -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Non-insulin-dependent diabetes -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Neuropeptides.</field><field name="subject">Homeostatis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The triumphal arch motif in Sant'Andrea, Mantua: Respondeo and rhetoric in Alberti's architecture and theory</field><field name="creator">Carrer, Tomaso, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">Leon Battista Alberti's church of Sant' Andrea in Mantua has been closely studied by many Renaissance scholars in relation to its layout, dimensions, proportions, chronology, style and aesthetics, as well as earning its place in both Alberti's corpus and the sweep of Renaissance architecture. The thesis investigates how eloquence is embodied in the sequential repetition of the triumphal arch motif between inside and outside. This thesis it is based on extensive and critical review of historical and theoretical literature. It marks a close examination of Sant?Andrea and to lesser extent San Francesco in Rimini, revisiting key ideas, texts and words. The principal finding of the thesis is that Alberti?s concept of respondeo, as developed in De Re Aedificatoria is the key to understanding the triumphal arch motif and its repetition in the interior. The thesis also comprehensively outlines the variety of contexts in which repondeo can be understood. This term, correlated to the passing of time and to rhetorical-based Albertian terms as decorum and convenio, means a 'sensitive suitability' between parts.  The analysis of the triumphal arch motif of Sant?Andrea suggests that formalism has played a more important role in Alberti's design for this church than previously believed. This is by the motif's rigorous outline changing between the interior nave and the exterior fa??ade according to the observer's different visual perceptions. The rhetorical structure of the triumphal arch, in the way that it moves became from two to three dimensions in the fa??ade, seeks familiarity with the city's surrounding environment to establish simultaneity of actions. In this way, by joining the historical-religious point of references to a strategy of perception, the triumphal arch achieves public consensus. This rhetorical program is addressed especially by the patron of the church of Sant' Andrea Ludovico Gonzaga II also the ruler of Mantua with popular aspects of his public representations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture, Renaissance -- Italy.</field><field name="subject">Triumphal arches.</field><field name="subject">Alberti, Leon Battista, 1402-1472 -- De re aedificatoria.</field><field name="subject">San Sebastiano (Church : Mantua, Italy)</field><field name="subject">San Francesco (Rimini)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Revisitation behaviour in a non-transactional website context</field><field name="creator">Maulana, Amalia Ernawaty, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines revisitation behaviour in the context of non-transactional websites. A holistic framework based on theories from repeat purchase behaviour and satisfaction was developed and tested. This study is among the first to consider revisitation as analogous to repeat purchase behaviour. The premise of the model is that revisitation is determined through an evaluation of prior visits and that the elements influencing revisitation included satisfaction, involvement (site, product category and medium) and social influences. Five non-transactional websites were examined with the selection based on the website typology developed in this thesis - a typology that will benefit website research as it provides a consistent and generic framework. Data were collected using a crosssectional web-based online survey via the homepage of the websites. Since satisfaction is considered to be a central factor in traditional repeat purchase behaviour and in website use, the antecedents of satisfaction were also examined. Overall the findings support the importance of content quality as a factor in satisfaction and even though website users are increasingly more proficient, ease of use is still an influential factor as is the attitude to the brand that the site supports. It was found that the users??? motives for using the site affected the relationship between the quality of the perceived benefits and satisfaction. If the motivation to use the site was for information, then the impact of information quality on satisfaction was weaker than the impact of entertainment quality on satisfaction. Alternatively, if the motivation was for entertainment, then once again the impact of information quality on satisfaction was weaker than that of entertainment quality. Initial model testing showed that the only factor to influence revisitation behaviour was enduring site involvement. Cognizant of the dangers of ???data driven theory???, the relationship of the elements was reassessed. The resultant model shows that product category involvement directly influences enduring site involvement and that enduring site involvement is a central construct operating as a direct and a mediating influence between each of satisfaction, social influence, medium involvement and website revisitation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet marketing</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Internet users</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self neglect and squalor among older people: the ethics of intervention</field><field name="creator">McDermott, Shannon Cumming, School of Social Science &amp; International Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Self neglect among older people refers to situations in which older individuals fail to adequately maintain their environment and to perform essential self care tasks. This concept has been variably addressed in the fields of biomedicine, adult protection, and suicide prevention, yet minimal research has been conducted on this topic in Australia. While the existing literature acknowledges that these situations can pose considerable challenges for professionals, no research has explored the actual experience of these dilemmas in professional practice. This thesis aims to address these gaps by critically exploring how self neglect among older people is understood in the Australian context, investigating the content of ethical dilemmas that arise in these situations, and examining how professionals resolve these ethical dilemmas. A two-part, qualitative methodology was used to address the research aims. In Part One, a five-month period of participant observation was conducted at a community-based organisation that had obtained funding to provide case management to people living in squalor. In Part Two, 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals who worked with situations of squalor and self neglect in the community. The results from both parts of the research were analysed using NVivo, a software program specifically designed to assist in the analysis of qualitative data.  This research uncovered that, unlike the definition of self neglect used in the wider literature on this topic, participants clearly differentiated between personal neglect (self neglect) and environmental neglect (squalor and hoarding). Ethical dilemmas were common in these situations and fully understanding how professionals resolved these dilemmas required that both objective and relational approaches to ethics be used to analyse participant responses. In this way, a pluralistic approach to ethics emerged as the theory best suited to fully explore ethical decision-making in situations where older people were self neglecting or living in squalor. Decisions that resulted in good outcomes were found to be increasingly constrained by changes to services driven by neoliberalism and managerialism. Individual reflection and peer support emerged as important elements that helped professionals to cope with the ethical dilemmas and the practical constraints that were encountered in these situations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental illness.</field><field name="subject">Older people -- Mental health.</field><field name="subject">Community mental health services.</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Moral and ethical aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of apoptosis and cell cycle to augment transfection efficiency in CHO cell lines .</field><field name="creator">Wanandy, Nico Stanislaus, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the biopharmaceutical industry, essentially, there are three components that play the main role in producing biopharmaceutical products, the host cell, the expression vector and the bioreactor and/or production environment. To produce the highly valued and desired products, the choice of a suitable host is one of the most important aspects. The host required is not only required to produce the desired product, but also needs to demonstrate robustness in a bioreactor system. Constantly facing challenges in a bioreactor, cells often undergo apoptosis, a well-known limiting factor in biopharmaceutical production, which ultimately leads to low yield of valuable protein(s).  We have genetically engineered a CHO-K1 cell line to constitutively express human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and murine polyoma large T-antigen (PyLT-Ag) to generate Super-CHO and CHO-T respectively, two cell lines that can potentially serve different niches in the biopharmaceutical industry. In the first part of the project, we hypothesised that suspension-adapted Super-CHO and CHO-T cells are both resilient cell lines relative to the suspension-adapted CHO-K1 (designated as CHO-XL-99) when facing nutrient depletion, one of the most common problems in a bioreactor.  Furthermore, in the second part of this project, the suspension-adapted CHO cell lines were also tested against a cytotoxic heavy metal, cadmium. Without the protection of the metal-resistance element, metallothionein, both Super-CHO and CHO-T cells were also challenged with cadmium to demonstrate their robustness over the parental cell line, CHO-XL-99. In the subsequent study, this project also focussed on the transfection efficiency of each parental and engineered CHO cell lines. Different strategies have been employed in the past in an attempt to improve productivity in the biopharmaceutical industry, from alterations in vector construction, improved culture condition, down to enhanced product recovery. However, the transfer and expression of the gene-of-interest (GOI) has still proven to be the limiting factor for achieving increased specific productivity. In an effort to improve transfection efficiency, strategies including cell cycle synchronisation and various transfection methods to deliver the GOI into the cells have been employed. Thus, the third part of this project has used synchronising agents in conjunction with commercially available lipid- and polymer-based reagents as delivery vehicle for the model protein, EGFP. The combination of cell synchronisation and transfection vehicle on transfection efficiency is studied here, in addition to their individual or collective effect on cell growth, apoptosis and viability. In summary, this project demonstrates the incidence of apoptosis in the cell culture induced by nutrient depletion and heavy metal, and that the use of transfection reagents solely, or in combination with synchronising agents also correlates with the increase of apoptotic indices in the cell culture. The use of the robust cell lines for transfection is an important aspect, and the balance between cell viability and the effort for augmenting transfection efficiency has to be met in order to achieve the maximum biopharmaceutical yields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="subject">Transfection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemical signals in transported regolith in response to deeply buried Cu-Au mineralisation.</field><field name="creator">Mokhtari, Ahmad Reza, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transported regolith has the capacity to mask underlying mineralisation by restricting the migration of most trace elements to the surface. Oxidation of sulphides generates highly mobile H+ which may migrate to surface, resulting in alteration of minerals and redistribution of elements within transported regolith cover.  A detailed geochemical and geophysical study has been conducted at the Mandamah Cu-Au deposit in central-western New South Wales, where sub-economic mineralisation is covered by ~50 m of transported regolith and ~30 m of in situ regolith. A shallow-penetration electromagnetic survey was undertaken on nine transects and detailed mineralogical and selective extraction/ICP-MS geochemical analysis performed on regolith samples obtained from 107 soil cores and 16 pits spanning three extensive traverses across buried mineralisation. The selective extractions used were ammonium acetate, hydroxylamine.HCl and aqua regia.  A distinct vertical zonation exists in the upper two metres of the transported regolith cover across the site and is related to soil mineralogy, soil pH, electrical conductivity and the amount of selectively extractable elements using the different geochemical extractions. The upper zone of near-neutral soil pH contains organic material but little carbonate; the intermediate high-pH zone has up to 2% Mg-calcite; the underlying low-pH zone displays Fe mottling. This zonation results from precipitation of salts due to evaporation, changes in redox potentials and accumulation of organic materials, in an otherwise relatively homogeneous quartz-clay alluvium.  Ground conductivity measurements and selective extraction geochemistry display a strong response to parts of the underlying mineralisation. The principal signature is the depletion of Ca, S and Na, a reduction in the cation exchange capacity, the presence of non-carbonate alkalinity and a low electrical conductivity. A model to account for these patterns has been developed and involves a "prograde" stage of alteration of clay mineralogy and a redistribution of carbonates and various trace elements due to the development of an "acid chimney" above the oxidizing mineralisation during a period of elevated water tables and a "retrograde" stage involving a redistribution of some mobile elements back into the former acid chimney zone following the onset of more arid conditions. The results of this research demonstrate that the effects of sulphide mineralisation on the upper transported regolith at Mandamah can be detected using a combination of selective extraction geochemistry and shallow depth conductivity measurements. This technique has potential application in similar arid to semi-arid terrains.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regolith.</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origin and detection of bacterial species associated with lettuce and salad vegetables.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Peter James, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ready-to-eat vegetable salads containing lettuce as a main ingredient have become popular food items in recent years. Microorganisms associated with these products determine their shelf-life, sensory appeal and safety. This thesis investigates the bacterial ecology of lettuce, aspects of their pre-harvest contamination with microorganisms, and the presence of antimicrobial constituents in such produce. Commercial pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides), used during lettuce cultivation were examined as potential sources of microbial contaminants. None of the pesticide concentrates contained viable microorganisms. After reconstitution in water, two of the pesticides supported growth of inoculated species of Pseudomonas, Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Pesticides reconstituted in agricultural waters (bore, dam and river) supported the growth of microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas spp. and coliforms) naturally present in these waters. Unless properly managed, pesticide application could contribute microbial contaminants to vegetable produce, thereby affecting their quality.  Bacterial species associated with retail samples of lettuce were examined by plate culture on Tryptone Soy Agar and PCR-DGGE analysis. Macerates and rinses of lettuce sub-samples with and without addition of Tween 80 were examined to maximize bacterial recoveries. Predominant bacteria isolated by agar culture included species of Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Curtobacterium and Burkholderia, at populations of 103-106 cfu/g. PCR-DGGE was unable to recover the same incidence of species as agar culture and failed to detect bacteria in many samples. In some samples, PCR-DGGE detected species of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Serratia and Acinetobacter, not found by culture. Failure of the PCR-DGGE analyses was attributed to interference by plant chloroplast DNA. Preparative agarose gel electrophoresis of lettuce macerates was necessary to remove chloroplast DNA before application of PCR-DGGE analysis. Thirty percent of lettuce samples contained Acinetobacter species at 101-104 cfu/g when examined after culture on minimal salts agar or enrichment in Baumann enrichment medium. Other Acinetobacter media failed to give reliable isolation of these species from lettuce and salad vegetables. Lettuce could be an environmental source of Acinetobacter nosocomial infections.  Juices, solvent extracts and supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extracts of lettuce and capsicum samples did not exhibit antimicrobial action against a range of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacteriology, Agricultural.</field><field name="subject">Lettuce, Diseases and pests.</field><field name="subject">Vegetables -- Analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimedia theatre in the virtual age.</field><field name="creator">Klich, Rosemary, School of Media Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research aims to delineate various modes and means of communication in the field of multimedia theatre and to relate this field of practice to contemporary debates in both theatre and media studies. This thesis defines 'multimedia theatre' in two ways: firstly to include performance where media technologies are brought into the theatrical frame as a feature of the mise en scene, and secondly to refer to the area of new media performance, where a live performer may not be present but a high degree of performativity and liveness are achieved. Discourse in the field of digital aesthetics and new media theory is applied to examples and case studies of contemporary multimedia theatre practice to highlight the formal structures and modes of audience engagement operating within such work. Multimedia theatre may be characterised by the qualities of intermediality, immersion, interactivity, and postnarratvity, and these characteristics are used in this thesis as focal points to structure analysis and investigation.  The thesis also argues that recent developments in the field of multimedia theatre and performance may be viewed as related to a larger cultural shift predicated on the dissolution of the separation of the real and the virtual. It is further argued that multimedia theatre is acting as a forum for the exploration of the contemporary human experience, an experience shaped by the ubiquity of digital media and the development of a 'posthuman' perspective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multimedia (Art)</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Aethestics.</field><field name="subject">Virtual reality in art.</field><field name="subject">Performance art.</field><field name="subject">Theater -- Technological innovations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electronic and optical characterisations of silicon quantum dots and its applications in solar cells</field><field name="creator">Fangsuwannarak, Thipwan, Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the structural, optical and electrical properties of crystalline silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) are examined for application to silicon based tandem cells. The approach has been to concentrate on all silicon devices by taking advantage of quantum confinement in low-dimensional Si. RF magnetron co-sputtering provided the capability of creating superlattice structures in conjunction with high temperature annealing, to form Si nanocrystals in an oxide matrix. Structural techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), micro-Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIM) were employed to gather structural information about the SiQD/SiO2 SLs. The result combine presents that the packing density of Si QDs, correlated to the oxygen content of the silicon rich oxide layer can be control independently.  The effect of Si nanocrystallite density on Raman scattering is investigated. The preliminary results present that a decrease in the oxygen content (x) results in an increased sharpness of the Strokes-mode peak of nanocrystalline Si, attributed to an increase in the proportion of crystalline Si because of the increased number of SiQDs. However the influence of the surface region on the crystallite core intensity scattering becomes dominant, when SiQD size diameter is very small (less than 3 nm). The present work shows that a decrease in x-content leading to an increase of the SiQD concentration, initially results in the enhancement of the lateral conductivity in the SiQD superlattice material.  In this work, the Al contacting scheme, using a prolonged heat treatment technique at elevated temperature less than the eutectic point of Al and Si (577C) has been successfully applied to making Ohmic contacts on both SiQD SLs in oxide and nitride matrices. Activation energy (Ea) of SiQDs, extracted from a linear Arrhenius plot is investigated in the present work in order to expand the understanding of engineering electrical injection in laterally active paths. It is found that a lower barrier height of dielectric matrix influences to the lateral electron transport of the SiQDs in such dielectric matrix.  PL results confirm that the band gap of surface oxidized SiQDs widens due to quantum confinement. The present results reveal that the strong peak (Q-peak) due to quantum confinement is more effective in the emission with increasing SiQD concentration. The surface oxide is believed to play an important role in the reduction of SiQD luminescence due to a trapped exiciton. It is concluded that SiQDs surface oxide accompanied by a SiO2 matrix may not provide a good passivation in very small SiQD size. However the energy band gap and conductivity of the SiQDs are tunablity, in the optimum range of SiQD size and concentration. This observation may be important for future nanoelectronics applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Third generation.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Solar cells -- Materials.</field><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells -- Materials.</field><field name="subject">Quantum dots.</field><field name="subject">Silicon dioxide matrix.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation.</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power systems.</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor nanocrystals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being mobile: personalising the virtual, virtualising the physical.</field><field name="creator">Strakowicz, Sebastian, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the relationship between the mobile phone and its user and argue that this relationship is crucial in merging the contexts of public and private, the physical and virtual, imagined and real, past and present, author and audience. I view this relationship as crucial to understanding the shift in the role of the audience from passive receivers of content to active producers ('Mobile Produsers'). Further, I argue that the diverse contexts of mobile content production and the definition of the content itself have become the central means by which mobile phone practices are emerging. I draw on anthropology, social science and media studies in order to explore the impact of mobile contexts, content, and use on identity. I propose that this approach allows for a new understanding of mobile practices as a form of spectacle, especially what I refer to as the spectacle of the self. Produsership theory informs an understanding of mobile practices, content production and performance, and the Bahktinian concept of carnival becomes a useful term in analysing the mobile as both performance and spectacle. Through an analysis of mobile content within cinematic culture, social interaction, and mixed media environments I consider the ways in which the mobile functions not only as a tool for positioning the individual, but also as performing an integral part in a multi-user process of mobile content production. In this sense, mobile content can be understood as a map, and the mobile as a compass used by the produser to navigate the mobile?s diverse contexts. Furthermore, I demonstrate that mobile content is collectively constructed while being individually absorbed. It is reflective of both the context and its user and open to constant questioning and interpretation, which is then shared with others. Finally, this thesis explores the notion of being t/here as mode of participating with the mobile in time and space, where one's identity is distributed across virtual and physical spaces, simultaneously locating the user as both here and there (t/here).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular telephones -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Mass media -- Technological innovations.</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal communication -- Technological innovations -- Social aspects.</field><field name="subject">Digital media -- Social aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Osmoadaptation mechanisms of cyanobacteria and archaea from the stromatolites of hamelin pool, Western Australia.</field><field name="creator">Goh, Falicia Qi Yun, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The stromatolites of Shark Bay Western Australia, located in a hypersaline environment, is an ideal biological system for studying survival strategies of cyanobacteria and halophilic archaea to high salt and their metabolic cooperation with other bacteria. To-date, little is known of the mechanisms by which these stromatolite microorganisms adapt to hypersalinity. To understand the formation of these sedimentary structures, detailed analysis of the microbial communities and their physiology for adaptation in this environment are crucial. In this study, microbial communities were investigated using culturing and molecular methods. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene was carried out to investigate the diversity of microorganisms present. Unique phylotypes from the bacteria, cyanobacteria and archaea clone libraries were identified. Representative cyanobacteria isolates and Halococcus hamelinensis, a halophilic archaea isolated from in this study, were the focus for identifying osmoadaptation mechanisms. The presence of osmolytes in these microorganisms was detected by Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). It was found that the cyanobacterial isolates studied utilised different osmolytes. Glucosylglycerol, unique to marine cyanobacteria was not identified; instead various saccharides, glycine betaine and TMAO were the predominant solutes present. Thus cyanobacteria are likely to possess more complex mechanisms of adaptation to osmotic stress than previously thought. Findings here also indicated that H. hamelinensis accumulates glycine betaine and glutamate instead of potassium ions. DNA molecular methods were employed to identify candidate genes for the uptake of osmoprotectants. Three putative glycine betaine transporters from Halococcus hamelinensis were identified. Functionality of one of these glycine betaine transporters was determined by complementation studies. For the first time, an archaeal glycine betaine transporter was shown to be successfully complemented in a glycine betaine transport deficient mutant (E. coli MKH13). This study has increased our understanding of how microorganisms co-exist in fluctuating environments in response to solubilisation/precipitation or dilution/evaporation processes, resulting in a hypersaline environment. It also provides an excellent platform for the identification of any novel osmolytes/compatible solutes that might have been produced by these microorganisms that have been isolated for the first time from stromatolites.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stromatolites.</field><field name="subject">Stromatolites -- Westyern Australia.</field><field name="subject">Archaebacteria.</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria.</field><field name="subject">Microbial ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Truth, meaning and representation: questioning modes of analysis in interpretations of women's alcohol use.</field><field name="creator">Clayton, Belinda, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">At present, there is speculation that women's alcohol use is a growing biomedical concern. Whilst not dismissing the potential health problems from excessive alcohol use by women that the evidence suggests, this thesis does not necessarily take the view that women's alcohol use/abuse is merely a reflection of a biomedical concern. Drawing predominantly from feminist tools of analysis, this thesis examines the discourse of alcohol use/abuse and reveals that mainstream interpretations of the epidemiological evidence are informed by an underlying sexism inherent in the research process itself. However, it is also argued that although popular interpretations can be contested on the grounds of sexism, there is a significant body of evidence that suggests women suffer more alcohol-related biological harm than men do. Given that epidemiological researchers are evidently observing something organically manifest, something perfectly correlative with the popular representation of a female vulnerability to alcohol related harm, this investigation cannot be reduced to the realm of cultural analysis and interpretation. The question then emerges, how can cultural assumptions that guide interpretations of the evidence become biologically manifest?  Upon deeper reflection, this investigation turns its attention to relations of power and reveals the biological body and the discourses that produce it to be more closely aligned than generally presumed. This thesis argues that nature (the body) and culture (discourse) are not inherently oppositional, thus, the way we "conceptualise" the world must be inseparable from the "matter" under investigation. Based on this revelation, it is reasonable to consider that normalising discourse, which founds the meaning-making process of alcohol use, is not simply a re-presentation of the natural/organic world, but is constitutive of, and inherently writing the biological world it describes. Thus, rather than erecting material/conceptual borders that reinforce the polarisation of the nature/culture division, this thesis proposes a way to think difference more generously, in a way that allows for a closer reconciliation of the historical division between the "theory" and the "lived" experience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women -- Alcohol use.</field><field name="subject">Women in mass media.</field><field name="subject">Sexism.</field><field name="subject">Feminism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of heterocyclic dimers derived from isoflavones and flavones.</field><field name="creator">Deodhar, Mandar, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this project was to synthesize new heterocyclic dimers of isoflavones and flavones, and investigate various methodologies for their synthesis. The secondary aim of the project was to synthesize some flavonoid natural products. Dimeric systems were synthesized using various methodologies including acid catalyzed arylation of isoflavanols and flavanols, acid catalyzed dimerization of flavenes, oxidative dimerization, Sonogashira coupling, Ullmann coupling and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions. The acid catalyzed arylation of isoflavanols was found to proceed in a very stereoselective fashion to give trans-4-arylisoflavans in good yield in a single step. However, related flavanols under similar conditions gave mixtures of cis and trans isomers of 4-arylflavans. Interestingly, it was found that appropriately substituted flavenes, upon treatment with acid undergo stereoselective rearrangement and dimerization to give benzopyranobenzopyrans in high yields. A rationale for the rearrangement is proposed and this dimerization was used for the stereoselective synthesis of the natural product dependensin. As part of the project, some polycyclic natural products such as octandrenolone, flemiculosin, 3-deoxy-MS-II and laxichalcone were also synthesized.  Oxidative dimerization of activated isoflavones was found to be very regioselective, and novel isoflavone dimeric systems were synthesized. Related flavones however, failed to undergo dimerization under similar conditions. A probable explanation for high regioselectivity in the case of isoflavones and unreactivity of flavones has been presented. Phenol oxidative coupling was used for the one-step synthesis of another natural product kudzuisoflavone-A from daidzein. Sonogashira coupling was utilized for the synthesis of dimeric systems linked via an acetylic linker. A variety of soflavone isoflavone, flavone-flavone and isoflavone-flavone dimers were synthesized in "one-pot" by this methodology and in excellent yields. Although Ullmann coupling was found not to be suitable for the synthesis of isoflavone or flavone dimers, one-pot Suzuki-Miyaura methodology gave flavone dimers and various other heterocyclic dimers in good yields.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Synthesis.</field><field name="subject">Dimers.</field><field name="subject">Flavonoids -- Synthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The troubled surface of architecture: John Ruskin, the human body, and external walls.</field><field name="creator">Chatterjee, Anuradha, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">The meaning of the architectural surface was thoroughly reconsidered by architects and historians in England and Europe between early and mid-nineteenth century. There were two major trends. The first one was historicist. Ornament and colour was considered important because it represented the origins of architecture. The second approach was rational and tectonic. It suggested that an honest surface had to be created by emphasizing the structure and by truthfully expressing materials. An unusual response to these debates was John Ruskin??s history of medieval and Renaissance architecture. This was published as The seven lamps of architecture (1849), and the three volume study, The stones of Venice (1851-1853). Ruskin??s writings were difficult to grasp. On the one hand, they were fragmented, historically inaccurate, and lacking in explanatory power. On the other hand, they emphasized surface ornament, without ever indicating its architectural ??use??. As a result, nineteenth and twentieth century historians and architects declared Ruskin??s writings as being irrelevant to architectural theory and practice. By examining Ruskin??s writings on architecture through the theoretical lens of dress, body, and gender, the thesis demonstrates that he proposed the theory of the adorned ??wall veil??.This was a two-part theory. Firstly, architecture was defined by the presence of planar walls. The masonry structure of these walls was masked and decorated by a seamless dress-like surface, consisting of relief and polychromatic ornaments. Secondly, Ruskin distinguished between the ideal and the corrupt dress. The ideal dress celebrated the spiritual aspects of the body (surface, skin, and colour). The corrupt dress represented the scientific image of the body (depth, bones and muscles, and form). The ideal dress was reflected by the surfaces of medieval buildings, and the corrupt dress was mirrored by the Renaissance architectural surface. Through these arguments, the thesis makes two major contributions. Firstly, it shows that Ruskin??s views were consistent with the architectural modernism of the twentieth century, in which the free fa??ade and the atectonic surface were key concerns. Secondly, it establishes that Gottfried Semper??s writings were not the sole origin of the debates on dress and architecture.

Experiments 1 to 3 examined the claim that the representations formed through inference learning are based only on the encoding of prototypical features (e.g., Yamauchi &amp; Markman, 1998, 2000). Adults learned artificial categories through exemplar classification or feature inference. Inference learning either did or did not require attention to prototypical features. At test, all participants classified exemplars and inferred the values of missing features. Classification learning resulted in the encoding of both prototypical and atypical features. Inference learning also led to the representation of both prototypical and atypical features when attention to both was required during learning. Experiment 4 extended these results to inferences about novel items varying in similarity to training items. Inference learners required to attend to prototypical and atypical features during training were more sensitive to exemplar similarity when making novel inferences than those who attended only to prototypical features.  Experiment 5 examined developmental change in the impact of noun and feature labels on feature inferences. Adults, 7-year-olds, and 5-yearolds were shown pairs of base and target exemplars. The base was given a noun or feature label. Participants were asked to predict the value of a missing feature of the target, when it was given the same or a different label as the base. Both adults and children were more likely to make inferences based on noun than feature labels. Hence, by five years of age, children grasp the inductive potential of noun labels. Experiments 6 to 9 compared incidental category learning with intentional classification. Adults classified categories of geometric shapes or learned the categories through an incidental task. Incidental recognition learning resulted in a broader allocation of attention than classification learning. Performing recognition before classification resulted in a broader attentional allocation than performing recognition after classification. Together with the results from mathematical modelling, these findings support a view of category learning in which the specific attentional demands of different learning tasks determine the nature of the category representations that are acquired.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning, Psychology of.</field><field name="subject">Categorization (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Inference.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</field><field name="creator">Vucic, Ostoja Steve, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the pathophysiology of motor neurone dysfunction, along with site of disease onset, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The rationale for this thesis is the "dying forward" hypothesis, which suggests that corticomotoneurons cause anterograde excitotoxic degeneration of motor neurons in ALS. Initially, axonal excitability studies were applied to ALS patients and revealed widespread axonal ion channel dysfunction, with increases in persistent Na+ conductances and reduction in K+ currents. Such changes result in axonal hyperexcitability, thereby resulting in generation of fasciculations and cramps. Subsequently, axonal excitability studies were applied to Kennedy's disease (KD) patients, a pathological control group, revealing similar changes to ALS and suggesting that upregulation of persistent Na+ conductances was responsible for generation of fasciculations.  To better understand the mechanisms underlying fatigability and to assess whether Na+/K+ pump dysfunction contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS, activity-dependent changes in axonal excitability were measured after a maximal voluntary contraction. The increase in threshold was more pronounced in ALS patients with predominantly lower motor neuron involvement, suggesting that peripheral factors were responsible for fatigue in ALS and that Na+/K+ pump function was preserved.  Having documented abnormalities of axonal excitability, a novel threshold tracking transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique was developed for assessment of cortical excitability. This technique overcomes the marked variability in the motor evoked potential with consecutive stimuli, a major limitation of the previous "constant stimulus" technique. After establishing normative data, threshold tracking TMS established that cortical hyperexcitability was an early and prominent feature in ALS. Similar changes were found in flail-arm variant ALS, a pure lower motor neuron form of ALS. In KD patients, cortical excitability was normal, thereby suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability is a primary event in ALS rather than a down-regulation of inhibitory control over the motor cortex in order to compensate for anterior horn cell loss.  In order to determine whether cortical hyperexcitability underlies motor neurodegeneration, longitudinal studies were undertaken in familial ALS subjects with the copper/zinc superoxide-dismutase-1 gene mutation. These studies established that cortical hyperexcitability precedes the development of clinical ALS, thereby suggesting that cortical hyperexcitability underlies the basis of motor neurodegeneration in familial ALS.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</field><field name="subject">Physiological, Pathological.</field><field name="subject">Motoer Neuron Disease -- Therapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I am because we are</field><field name="creator">Love, Rodney, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contextualizes the three series of work that I have produced for my MFA. My chief concerns are with the dynamic between the individual and the collective, and how this is symbolically represented in lists of names. I also suggest that an underlying sense of communitas, or equality, is evoked through lists of names. I explore this idea further in an examination of various memorials where the naming of those commemorated is a major element of the work. I then describe the work that I have made, and connect it to other artworks that also use lists of names in order to explore the idea of what it is to be both an individual and a member of a group. I suggest that artworks and memorials are potent as carriers of symbolic meaning because they allow space and time for contemplation. In addition to the use of names, I also look at artworks that use items that have belonged to people as substitutes for those people, and as metaphors for humanity. My work utilises human hair and socks, but other artists use different types of contiguous possessions as stand-ins for individuals. The examples are chosen to investigate the variety of tropes available for memorial designers and artists, and in order to see the way diverse materials can be used to investigate similar concerns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Names in art.</field><field name="subject">Memorials.</field><field name="subject">Textile fabrics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of the variation of fundamental constants in atoms</field><field name="creator">Angstmann, Elizabeth, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Interest in the variation of fundamental constants has recently been stimulated by claims that the fine structure constant, &#945;, was smaller in the past. Physicists are investigating whether &#945; is currently varying using a number of methods including atomic clock experiments and quasar absorption spectra. To date atomic clock experiments have not reached the same level of precision as the quasar results but the precision to which transition frequencies are being measured is increasing dramatically and very soon atomic clock experiments based on Earth will be able to rival or surpass the quasar results. In order to relate the change in transition frequencies to a variation of &#945; accurate calculations of relativistic effects in atoms and their dependence upon &#945; are needed. Other effects, such as the small shift of transition frequencies due to blackbody radiation also need to be accounted for.  In this thesis we perform accurate calculations of the dependence of transition frequencies in two-valence-electron atoms and ions on a variation of &#945;. The relativistic Hartree-Fock method is used with many-body perturbation theory and configuration interaction methods to calculate transition frequencies.  We also consider transitions with an enhanced sensitivity to &#945; variation. In particular, narrow lines that correspond to atomic transitions between close lying, long-lived atomic states of different configurations. The small transition frequency, coupled with differences in the electron structure ensures a strong enhancement of the relative frequency change compared to a possible change in &#945; . We also show that using the modified form of the Dirac Hamiltonian, as suggested by Bekenstein, does not affect the analysis of the quasar data pertaining to a measurement of &#945; variation, nor does it affect atomic clock experiments.  Finally we have performed calculations of the size of the frequency shift induced by a static electric field on the clock transition frequencies of the hyperfine splitting in Y b+, Rb, Cs, Ba+, and Hg+. The calculations are used to find the frequency shifts due to blackbody radiation which are needed for accurate frequency measurements and improvements of the limits on variation of &#945;. Our result for Cs [??v/=E2 = -2:26(2) x 10-10Hz/(V/m)2] is in good agreement with early measurements and ab initio calculations. We present arguments against recent claims that the actual value might be smaller. The difference (~ 10%) is due to the continuum spectrum in the sum over intermediate states.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics.</field><field name="subject">Particles (nuclear physics)</field><field name="subject">Atomic units.</field><field name="subject">Fine structure constant.</field><field name="subject">Variational principles.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global television formats in the People's Republic of China: popular culture, identity and the 'Mongolian cow sour yoghurt super girls contest'.</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Xi Wen, School of English, Media &amp; Performing Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the television program known as 'Super Girls', which aired on Hunan Satellite Television from 2004-2006 in the Peoples' Republic of China. In the West, this program is sometimes referred to as 'Chinese Idol' because of its similarities to the globally popular television format, 'Idol'. Although 'Super Girls' shares many similarities with 'Idol'  there are also equally important differences. This thesis examines these differences as a way of theorising the how the program negotiates the localisation of a Western television format. First, the program is placed in the broader context of the increased liberalisation and commercialisation of the Chinese television industry. Secondly, the thesis analyses the concept of format television and presents the logic behind the global shift toward producing this type of programming. Next, specific aspects of Super Girls are analysed in detail to bring out how the program functioned culturally in the context of China. These aspects of Super Girls include, the way the program represents the changing role and potential of television from the PRC to contribute to negotiations on Chinese identity that take place among the various symbolic universes of Cultural China, including the global Chinese Diaspora. The thesis also explores the nature of the celebrities produced by the contest through isolating their meaning and significance within the Chinese context. The thesis argues that the contest winners are celebrated for their individuality and come to stand for the rise of 'ordinary power'. The thesis also examines the ways in which Super Girls embraces its audience through new modes of address and offering new types of agency for its audience. As a result, Super Girls offers insight into how Chinese culture is now shaped by a rise of 'ordinary empowerment' where the bottom-up cultures are hybridised with the traditional high culture in television broadcasting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Television broadcasting -- China.</field><field name="subject">Popular culture -- China.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playing in the in-between: implications for early childhood education of new views on social relations.</field><field name="creator">?? Beckett, Cynthia June, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Social relations are commonly seen as exchanges between entities, a view implicitly indebted to Hegel?s account of the development of independent subjectivity. It is an analysis that explains many social interactions but that cannot explain key moments in social life. These moments occur in the non-Euclidean space and time of the in-between. This concept will be elucidated in this thesis through analysis of fieldwork examples and in relation to the work of Martin Buber and Donald Winnicott. The in-between arises when adults and children play together in the way described by Winnicott as playing in the third zone.  A phenomenological, interpretive analysis of forms of relations between parents and their two year old children revealed playing in the in-between during everyday family life. While the fieldwork focuses on families at home, the arguments are not restricted to this arena. It has implications for those working with young children, challenging the current emphasis on a task-oriented focus on teaching and learning.  A focus on social exchange creates early childhood programs that lack opportunities for being in the present moment in an unforced, un-knowing way. Such programs achieve set goals but may lack moments of infinite mutuality and tenderness such as those observed in the research. Relations cannot form when there is a continual focus on what is understood and known, on past  accomplishments and future objectives.  The in-between has three aspects; being fully present, un-knowing and mutuality through love. This analysis provides new views that will encourage opportunities for children and staff to be with one another in simple but profound moments of the in-between.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parent and child.</field><field name="subject">Child development.</field><field name="subject">Education -- Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Education, Preschool.</field><field name="subject">Play -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of Algal Epifauna to pulsed and chronic contamination of temperate Algal beds.</field><field name="creator">Roberts, David A, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contaminants may affect marine organisms through various pathways with impacts evident across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Organisms may encounter short pulsed exposures which contaminate surface waters for hours to days, or more persistent but patchy contamination of benthic habitats throughout their entire life-cycle. This thesis examines the responses of epifauna associated with macroalgae to a pulsed exposure of contaminants (storm-water input) and to chronic contamination via metal accumulation within temperate algal beds. The effects of storm water were monitored during a two-year survey of Sydney Harbour which sampled epifauna before and after heavy rainfall. Epifaunal assemblages declined throughout the harbour following storm events but for the most part these declines were not attributable to storm-water runoff. However, transient (&amp;lt 4 d) and localized impacts of storm water upon physico-chemical characteristics of recipient water and some epifaunal groups were identified around storm drains. A novel field dosing technique tested the relative importance of freshwater and associated metals as causative agents of behavioural avoidance and direct mortality responses. Strong avoidance of storm-water plumes was found which could be entirely explained by freshwater inundation, with no additional effects of metals. No direct mortality was observed following brief exposures. Contaminants introduced by storm water may accumulate within the tissues of macroalgae and potentially pose persistent threats to epifauna. Colonisation of epifauna was reduced on algae with enhanced copper levels, and the nesting behaviour, feeding and survival of an abundant amphipod were all negatively affected by copper load. Subsequent field surveys identified sufficient copper, lead and zinc contamination in Sydney Harbour algal beds to pose direct toxic threats to epifauna. The abundance of herbivorous amphipods correlated negatively with the copper content of a common algal species. However, differences in metal accumulation between algal species resulted in spatially variable levels of contamination. Small-scale patchiness of contaminants within these landscapes may allow populations of mobile species to persist if contaminated hosts are avoided. In summary, epifaunal assemblages appeared resilient to storm-water pulses. Recovery of affected groups was rapid and large fluctuations in abundance appear to be part of the natural flux of epifaunal communities. In contrast, assemblages responded strongly to algal-bound contaminants and this has emerged as an important pathway of contaminant exposure and impact within algal habitats.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Marine pollution</field><field name="subject">Water -- Pollution</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">Chronic toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">Copper -- Toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">Metals -- Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Individuals' responses to changes in risk: a person-specific analysis.</field><field name="creator">Schwartz, Carmit M, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we consider two comparative statics questions of changes in risk. The first question concerns situations where an individual faces some risk and has no control over the uncertain environment. In these situations we ask what kind of changes in risk will cause the individual's expected utility to increase. The second comparative statics question concerns situations where an individual faces some risk and has some control over the uncertain environment. In particular, we consider situations where the individual maximizes her expected utility with respect to some control parameter. Here we ask what kind of changes in risk will cause the individual's optimal value of the control parameter to increase.  The existing literature has answered these questions for a class of individuals (for example, the class of risk averse individuals). This thesis differs from existing literature as it focuses on a given individual, and thus reveals some of the person-specific factors that affect individual?s responses to changes in risk. The aim of the thesis is to show how an order on distributions, termed single crossing likelihood ratio (SCLR) order, can intuitively answer both questions for a given individual.  The main contributions of the thesis are as follows. First, the thesis presents the SCLR order and its main properties. Second, the thesis shows that the SCLR order can answer the above comparative statics questions in an intuitive way. In particular, the thesis shows that the answer to the above questions, with the use of the SCLR order, depends on a risk reference point which can be interpreted as a "certainty equivalent" point. Thus it is demonstrated that individual's responses to changes in risk are affected by her "certainty equivalent" point. Lastly, the results of the thesis can be used to provide an intuitive explanation of related existing results that were obtained for a class of individuals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk assessment -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Risk management -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Risk -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Utility theory -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Statics and dynamics (Social sciences) -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Stochastic orders.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and verification of web services protocols.</field><field name="creator">Ramsokul, Pemadeep Kumar, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Among the plethora of solutions to the Business-to-Business interoperability problem, no other solution has obtained as much attention asWeb Services Technology (WST), which allows entities to exchange data regardless of their underlying platforms. WST also allows services to be composed in order to provide high quality customer service over the web.  In order to perform transactions across different service providers, standard protocols need to be supported by participating providers. Many useful protocols are coming into the market, but are often ambiguously specified by protocol designers and not fully verified. Furthermore, even if the specifications are reasonably clear, programmers often make subtle assumptions, possibly leading to errors that are hard to detect and locate, especially when the number of participating entities is dynamic. Consequently, these can lead to interoperability problems among implementations of the same protocol and high software maintenance costs.  To address these issues, a hierarchical automata-based framework is proposed to model the functional aspects of Web Services (WS) protocols that also assists in verifying their correctness. The modelling formalism has a sound mathematical foundation and aims to reconcile desirable features while still maintaining syntactic and semantic simplicity.  The properties to be verified are specified using a pattern system and/or 'observer' states, which have been adapted for WS protocols. In particular, always in a  positive observer state implies proper termination and partial functional correctness while reachability of a negative observer state signifies deadlock and/or violation of a safety property. Verification itself is handled by automatic translation of the model and its properties into a model-checker's input code and interpretation of the output produced by the model-checker.  A test-bed is proposed to check the conformance of a protocol implementation to its specification It helps in locating errors in the implementations of WS protocols especially where the number of participating entities is dynamic. Conformance checking is achieved by capturing sequences of exchanged messages of the actual implementations and checking them against the formal specification.  Experience using the framework is also described and illustrated using two non-trivial WS protocols, namely WS-BusinessActivity and WS-AtomicTransaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services</field><field name="subject">Web services -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols -- Specifications</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Computer programs -- Verification</field><field name="subject">Electronic data interchange</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A software system for radionuclide dosimetry with applications.</field><field name="creator">McKay, Erin, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Radiation dosimetry is necessary for optimising radiation-based medical procedures for individual patients but in the field of nuclear medicine there are few widely available or widely used tools for performing this kind of analysis. Those tools that are available tend to focus on one particular component of the dosimetry problem and integrating tools to form a complete system is left to the end-user.  A software system for performing individual, image-based dosimetry analysis of nuclear medicine studies has been developed and validated. The system consists of a suite of tools that use common file formats and data models. The tools can be integrated to form applications by means of a simple scripting system. One tool is a gamma camera simulator that can produce realistic images of dynamic activity distributions in planar or tomographic formats. Simulated imaging studies produced by this tool are used to validate the other tools in the system. In addition, the system implements a method of simulation assisted quantitation which is shown to achieve high accuracy in both software and physical phantom studies.  The system is applied to the dosimetry of I-131 Lipiodol, a therapeutic agent used to treat primary and secondary cancers of the liver. Simulation studies are used to validate the analytic methods used. Studies of a series of patients, treated over a period 10 years, are retrospectively analysed using a selection of methods appropriate to the available data.  The results of the analysis demonstrated a large range of lung doses from 1 to 10 Gy/GBq administered. The median absorbed dose in liver was 3 Gy (range 1 - 10 Gy) and the median absorbed dose in tumor was 19 Gy (range 5 - 84 Gy).

There were two groups of Febase alloys; ferritic alloys that were Fe-Al-Cr and others that also contained approximately 9.3 at% Ni in order to make them austenitic. Ni?base alloys were oxidised in oxygen partial pressures of either 4.6 ?? 10-11 atm or 9.8 ?? 10-13 atm and Febase alloys were oxidised in an oxygen partial pressure of 1.2 ?? 10-16 atm  The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of internal oxidation on Fe- and Ni-base alloys containing Al or Al with Cr. The morphology of the precipitates formed and rates of reaction were of interest. Oxidation of the ferritic Fe-base alloys produced internal oxidation only at lower solute concentrations. In these alloys steady state diffusion-controlled precipitation was prevented from occurring due to the formation of an oxide barrier at the reaction front, and cracking off of the internal oxidation zone. In all of the austenitic alloys (Ni-base and y-Fe-base) internal oxidation was observed after all exposures. In y-Fe-base alloys and in Ni-base alloys oxidised at the higher oxygen partial pressure (4.6 ?? 10-11 atm) precipitation zones were found to widen according to parabolic kinetics, indicating diffusion control. In Ni-base alloys oxidised at 9.8 ?? 10-13 atm, precipitation zones were observed to widen according to parabolic kinetics up to 40.9 hours. However, the rate slowed for longer reaction times due to coalescence of precipitates at the reaction front. The rate of internal oxidation decreased with increasing Cr, and thus total solute, concentration. The parabolic rate constants measured for internal oxidation were higher than predicted by Wagner's theory of internal oxidation, which is consistent with observations in previous studies. Kinetics were accelerated by the presence of elongated precipitates, aligned approximately normal to the alloy surface. Chromium alloy additions led to precipitate coarsening, and at lower oxygen partial pressures, to loss of elongated morphology. The precipitates formed were found to be a mixture of M2O3 and AM2O4, where M represents either Al or Cr, and A represents either Fe or Ni. Both oxide forms were detected at all depths within the internal oxidation zone. However, Cr-containing oxides were limited to the part of the internal oxidation zone closer to the alloy surface, while Al-containing oxides were present at all depths. This is consistent with thermodynamic predictions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nickel alloys.</field><field name="subject">Iron alloys.</field><field name="subject">Oxidation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pressure effects on neurons: investigations into the pathogenesis of glaucoma.</field><field name="creator">Agar, Ashish, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cellular responses to changes in pressure are implicated in numerous disease processes. In glaucoma apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is associated with elevated intra-ocular pressure (IOP), however the exact cellular basis of this link remains unclear. This research aimed to examine the direct response of neuronal cells to elevated hydrostatic pressure in terms of apoptosis. We developed an in vitro model consisting of a pressure chamber to adjust ambient hydrostatic pressure, a source of neuronal cells and methods to measure apoptosis in these cells. The neural cells examined were primary retinal cultures, four neuronal cell lines (B35, PC12, C17, NT2), and the RGC-5 cell line. Pressure conditions selected were within physiological limits; 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure (as seen clinically in severe acute glaucoma) and extended in RGC-5 neurons to 30 mmHg (chronic glaucoma) and 15 mmHg (normal IOP). Apoptosis was detected by cell morphology and specific immunochemical markers: TUNEL and Annexin V. Caspase-3 activation, a known pathway of apoptosis, was also investigated in RGC-5 neurons. These fluorescent markers were detected and quantified by automated Laser Scanning Cytometry. Negative controls were treated identically except for the application of pressure, while positive controls were generated by treatment with a known apoptotic stimulus. The results showed that neurons responded to elevated hydrostatic pressure directly and that an apoptotic process was induced. There was a greater level of apoptosis in pressurised cells compared to the negative controls. This apoptotic effect at high pressures was seen in primary rat retinal cultures and in both undifferentiated (B35, C17, NT2, RGC-5) and differentiated (PC12, RGC-5) neuronal cell lines. RGC-5 neurons showed a graded response, proportionate to the level of pressure elevation, representative of the severity of analogous clinical settings (acute, chronic glaucoma &amp; normal). RGC-5 neurons also showed increased activation of Capsase-3. Thus this pathway may play a role in pressure induced apoptosis. Our findings indicate that pressure alone may act as a stimulus for apoptosis in neuronal cells. We suggest the possibility of novel mechanisms of pressure related mechanotransduction and cell death, relevant to the pathogenesis of glaucoma.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intraocular pressure</field><field name="subject">Glaucoma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real time communications over on-board mobile networks</field><field name="creator">Malik, Muhammad Ali, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has recently released routing standards that allow deployment of TCP/IP local area networks (LANs) onboard a moving vehicle and yet maintain permanent connectivity of the onboard LAN to the Internet via a vehicular mobile router. This recent development opens up new opportunities for providing efficient mobile computing for users on the move, especially for commuters traveling on public transports. Supporting real-time communications, e.g. IP Telephony, on-line video on demand, etc., over such onboard mobile networks is the main motivation of this thesis. Due to the volatility of the wireless bandwidth available to connect the moving LAN to the Internet at different locations of the trip, supporting on-line services that require bandwidth guarantees becomes a challenging task. The main problem investigated is how to provide bandwidth guarantee efficiently, effectively, and in a scalable manner in the context of moving onboard networks. To achieve the goal, a systematic approach is taken that involves (i) designing a signalling protocol that allows transparent bandwidth reservation for the aggregate demand of all onboard users in the vehicle, and (ii) proposing effective aggregation and bandwidth reservation policies that aim to maximize the chances of successful reservation and minimize the bandwidth and processing overhead in critical network elements. Mathematical models are derived to evaluate the performance of proposed solutions. These models are validated using discrete event simulation. One important conclusion reached is that onboard mobile communication provides significant aggregation and centralized management opportunities that must be exploited to provide a scalable solution to the bandwidth guarantee problem in mobile communications. The techniques proposed and analyzed in this thesis to exploit such aggregation opportunities constitute the original contribution to knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="subject">Personal communicaiton communication service systems.</field><field name="subject">Wireless Internet.</field><field name="subject">Local area networks (Computer networks)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spin and charge properties of Si: P probed using ion-implanted nanostructures</field><field name="creator">McCamey, Dane Robert, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the defects, charge states and spin properties of phosphorus doped silicon, and is motivated by a number of proposals for quantum information processing (QIP) that involve using the spin or charge of individual donors in silicon as qubits. The implantation of phosphorus into silicon is investigated; specifically the ability to remove damage and activate the implanted donors. The impact of implantation on the transport properties of silicon MOSFETs at cryogenic temperatures is used to investigate the damage. Implanting phosphorus into the MOSFET channel leads to reduced electron mobility. The defect density increases linearly with implant density (??ndefect = 0.08 ?? 0.01nimplant). Silicon implantation does not show this effect, suggesting that the additional defects are ionised P donors in the channel. Implant activation for low density donors was complete for an implant density of 2 x 1012 cm2. Similar studies were undertaken on devices with a variety of dielectrics. Thermally grown SiO2 was found to have the lowest defect density of those studied, although Al2O3 deposited via atomic layer deposition was found to have properties that may be useful for the fabrication of devices with low thermal processing budgets. The as-grown defect density of the thermal silicon dioxide was found to be 2.1 ?? 0.3 x 1011 cm2. Ion implantation of nanoscale devices allowed the spin properties of a small number of phosphorus donors in silicon to be probed via electrically detected magnetic resonance. This allowed the detection of the spin resonance of as few as 100 spins. This represents an improvement in number detection of 4 orders of magnitude over previous EDMR studies of donors in silicon. EDMR was used to investigate the properties of P donors in isotopically purified 28Si . The material had a background doping level too high to detect small numbers of spins, however, the narrow linewidth of the phosphorus resonance confirm that the isotopic purity is greater than 0.999. A proof-of-principle demonstration of pulsed EDMR of ion-implanted donors in silicon is presented. The spin dependent transient that results from manipulating the donor spins via pulsed ESR is sensitive to as few as 104 donors, and is a required component for observation of spin Rabi oscillations by this technique.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nanostructures.</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Electron para magnetic resonance.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Ion implantation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capital structure and dividend policy in a personal tax free environment: the case of Oman</field><field name="creator">Al Yahyaee, Khamis, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines four specific aspects of capital structure and dividend policy. The first issue concerns the determinants of capital structure dynamics. The primary objective is to examine whether stock returns are important factors in firm???s capital structure choice, and if so, whether this effect is persistent. In so doing, we use a data set which (1) avoids the complexity of tax rates faced by previous studies, (2) we introduce new variables that are unique to Oman, and (3) we distinguish empirically between bank debt and non-bank debt. We find stock returns are a first order determinant of capital structure. Firms do show some tendency to rebalance towards their target capital structure. However, the impact of stock returns dominates the effects of rebalancing. We also find new evidence that firms do take countermeasures to offset changes in their leverage that stem from equity value variations, but do so at a low speed. The next topic studied concerns the ex-dividend day behaviour. We investigate this issue using a unique data set where there are no taxes on dividends and capital gains and stock prices are decimalized. In this economy, any price decline that is smaller than the dividends can not be attributed to taxes and price discreteness. We find that the stock price drops by less than the amount of dividends and there is a significant positive ex-day return. We are able to account for our results using market microstructure models. The third issue investigated is the stock price reaction to dividend announcements. Tax-based signaling models argue that dividends would not have  information and be informative if it is not for the higher taxes on dividends relative to capital gains that they apply to shareholders. The absence of personal taxes in Oman presents a valuable opportunity to test this prediction. Our results show that the announcements of dividend increases (decreases) are associated with a stock price increase (decrease) which contradicts the tax-based signaling models. The final chapter analyzes the determinants and stability of dividend policy of financial and non-financial firms. Investigating this issue is important for at least two reasons. First, Omani firms distribute almost 100% of their profits in dividends which led the Capital Market Authority (CMA) to issue a circular (number 12/2003) arguing that firms should retain some of their earnings for ???rainy days???. This allows us understand the characteristics of firms that pay dividends. Second, firms are highly levered mainly through bank loans which render the role of dividends in reducing the agency costs less important. Unlike most previous studies, we include both dividend paying and non-dividend paying firms to avoid a selection bias. We find that there are some common factors that determine dividend policy of both financial and non-financial firms and there are some factors that affect only non-financial firms. We also find that the factors that influence the probability to pay dividends are the same factors that drive the amount of dividends paid for both financial and non-financial firms. We document that non-financial firms adopt a policy of smoothing dividends while financial firms do not have a stable dividend policy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Oman -- Finance</field><field name="subject">Dividends</field><field name="subject">Stocks -- Prices</field><field name="subject">Bank capital -- Oman</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sociology of numbers: statistics and social policy in Australia</field><field name="creator">Neylan, Julian, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents an historical-sociological study of how governments of the modern western state use the language and techniques of quantification in the domain of social policy. The case material has an Australian focus. The thesis argues that by relying on techniques of quantification, governments risk introducing a false legitimacy to their social policy decisions. The thesis takes observed historical phenomena, language and techniques of quantification for signifying the social, and seeks meaningful interpretations in light of the culturally embedded actions of individuals and collective members of Australian bureaucracies. These interpretations are framed by the arguments of a range of scholars on the sociology of mathematics and quantitative technologies. The interpretative framework is in turn grounded in the history and sociology of modernity since the Enlightenment period, with a particular focus on three aspects: the nature and purpose of the administrative bureaucracy, the role of positivism in shaping scientific inquiry and the emergence of a risk consciousness in the late twentieth century. The thesis claim is examined across three case studies, each representative of Australian government action in formulating social policy or providing human services. Key social entities examined include the national census of population, housing needs indicators, welfare program performance and social capital. The analysis of these social statistics reveals a set of recurring characteristics that are shown to reduce their certainty. The analysis provides evidence for a common set of institutional attitudes toward social numbers, essentially that quantification is an objective technical device capable of reducing unstable social entities to stable, reliable significations (numbers). While this appears to strengthen the apparatus of governmentality for developing and implementing state policy, ignoring the many unarticulated and arbitrary judgments that are embedded in social numbers introduces a false legitimacy to these government actions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Social policy -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Social policy -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Social indicators</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Social policy -- Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression through Chinese eyes: a window into public mental health in multicultural Australia</field><field name="creator">Chan, Bibiana Chi Wing, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under-utilisation of mental health services is widespread globally and within Australia, especially among culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities. Improving service access is a priority, as is the need to deliver culturally competent services to the CALD communities. Having migrated to Australia in waves for approximately 150 years from China and South East Asia for various social, political and economic reasons, the Chinese population in Sydney is now the fastest growing non-English speaking ethnic group.  There is a need to better understand the impact of culture on the emotional experiences of these Chinese in Australia. How do Chinese make sense of their depressive episodes?  To address this question, this study explored the ways participants reach out for medical and/or non-medical help. Lay concepts of illness underpin these decisions and were thus unveiled. Mixed-method research design provided the opportunity to bring together multiple vantage points of investigation: population mental health, transcultural psychiatry and medical anthropology. A study combining quantitative survey and qualitative focus groups was undertaken in metropolitan Sydney. Narratives on symptoms, explanatory models and help-seeking strategies were articulated by focus group informants. Surveys covered demographics, symptom-recognition, previous depressive experiences and professional help sought. Depression measurement tools were cross-culturally validated. Self-ratings of ethnic identities and the Suinn-Lew Self-Identity Acculturation Scale were used to quantify Chinese participants' acculturation level. This allowed comparisons between 'low-acculturated' Chinese', highly-acculturated' Chinese and Australians. Survey results showed comparable levels of symptom-recognition in all subgroups. Focus group discussions provided rich data on informants'  help-seeking strategies. Highly acculturated Chinese closely resembled the Australians in many study variables, yet qualitative data suggested cultural gaps beyond language barriers in influencing service use.  Participants believed that trustful relationships could work as the bridge to link services with those in need. The implications for Australia's mental health policy include recognising the importance of rapport-building and the existence of cultural gaps.  The study indicated professionals can benefit from acquiring information about the mental health beliefs both of individual clients and the wider ethnic communities in which they belong, and respecting the cultural differences between helper and helped as the first step towards cultural competency.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental health.</field><field name="subject">Depression.</field><field name="subject">Mental illness.</field><field name="subject">Acculturation.</field><field name="subject">Cultural competency.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Mental health -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Mental health services -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Community mental health services -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Community mental health services -- Planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic modelling studies of As(III) oxidation in dark pH 3 and 8 Fenton - mediated and pH 8 Cu(II) - H2O2 systems</field><field name="creator">Botfield, Andrew, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a combination of laboratory experimentation under well defined conditions coupled with a kinetic modelling approach is used to verify the existence and respective kinetic rates of previously unconfirmed or postulated mechanisms that drive and limit dark Fenton (Fe(II)/H2O2) - mediated As(III) oxidation at pH 3 and 8 and dark Cu(II) - H2O2 - mediated As(III) oxidation at pH 8. Dark Fenton - mediated oxidation of As(III) at pH 3 is first examined and the effects of the variation in the concentration of reactants (As(III), Fe(II) and H2O2), oxygen, phosphate and organics (2 - propanol, formate, and citrate) are reported and analysed. The kinetic models developed for these systems show high applicability to full scale water treatment application and key mechanistic findings include the significance of the cycling of Fe(II) / Fe(III) via HO2 ???/O2 ??????, the effects of As(IV) termination reactions in the absence of oxygen and the retarding effects of phosphate due to the postulated formation of a Fe(III) - phosphate complex (at a derived rate constant of 2.2 x 106 M-1s-1, that also appears to have negligible kinetic activity in terms of reduction to Fe(II) by HO2 ???/O2 ??????). The work also demonstrates the significance of the free radical by products of formate and citrate oxidation by ???OH (HCOO???/CO2 ?????? and 3HGA???2???). The examination of the dark Cu(II) - H2O2 - mediated oxidation of As(III) at pH 8 with variation in the concentration of reactants (As(III), Fe(II) and H2O2), carbonate and organics (2 - propanol, formate and citrate) demonstrated for the first time the high applicability of this system to the  pre - oxidation of As(III) in water treatment and mechanistically that ???OH and CO3 ?????? are the dominant As(III) oxidants in this system. The As(III) oxidant CO3 ??????, is suggested to be generated by the interaction of ???OH and O2 ?????? with the carbonate matrix, at the respective rate constants of 4.9 x 107 M-1s-1 and 5.5 x 106 M-1s-1. Examination of the dark Fenton - mediated oxidation of As(III) at pH 8 and the effects of variation in the concentration of reactants (As(III), Fe(II) and H2O2), carbonate, organics (2 - propanol, formate and citrate) and Cu(II) demonstrates the varied potential mechanistic pathways in relation to the generation of As(III) oxidants from the Fenton reaction, Fe(II) + H2O2 such as Fe(IV) and CO3 ?????? and the previously dismissed ???OH, due to the presence of Fe(II) - citrate complexes.

Many educational efforts have taught knowledge and skills to persons with an intellectual disability to improve their functioning in the work and leisure domains. More recently, retirement concerns have become particularly salient because so many individuals now live much longer. The present study looked at using a conceptual approach to improve education in these three domains. It employed the principles that instruction works much better when it proceeds from an individual=s existing concepts and that instruction should teach useful concepts that an individual can apply to improve his or her real world functioning. This conceptual approach has not been used much with the education of persons with an intellectual disability. In Study 1, sixty adults with an intellectual disability were interviewed to determine their existing concepts of work, leisure and retirement and their work and leisure histories. Most had solid concepts of work and leisure, but with some gaps, particularly in notions of volunteer work and occupational status. Most reported satisfactory work and leisure lives. Most had  a relatively poor concept of retirement at best and had done little or no retirement planning. These data suggested some key targets for an educational program to improve their knowledge and functioning in these domains. In Study 2, these data were used to develop an instructional program that focussed on gaps in knowledge of volunteer work, banking, budgeting and participation in satisfying leisure activities and in retirement planning. This instructional program was delivered over eight weeks to a class consisting of nine adults with an intellectual disability, with some success. This general conceptual approach can be usefully applied to teaching in other important domains with persons with an intellectual disability. They can be taught key concepts which they can use to live their lives more purposely and independently.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People with mental disabilities</field><field name="subject">People with mental disabilities -- Educaiton</field><field name="subject">Mental retardation -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An automated micro-grinding system for the fabrication of precision micro-scale profiles</field><field name="creator">Milton, Gareth Edward, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Production of micro-scale components is an important emergent field. One underdeveloped area is the production of micro-scale 3D surfaces, which has important applications in micro-optics and fibre optic sensors. One particular application is the production of micro-lenses. With scales of less than 200 ??m these lenses can improve light coupling efficiencies in micro-optic systems. However, current lens production techniques have limitations in accuracy and versatility. Creating these surfaces through mechanical micro-grinding has the potential to improve the precision and variety of profiles that can be produced, thus improving transmission efficiencies and leading to new applications. This work presents a novel micro-grinding method for the production of microscale asymmetric, symmetric and axisymmetric curved components from brittle materials such as glasses. A specialised micro-grinding machine and machining system has been designed, constructed and successfully tested and is presented here. This system is capable of producing complex profiles directly on the tips of optical fibre workpieces. A five degree of freedom centring system is presented that can align and rotate these workpieces about a precision axis, enabling axisymmetric grinding. A machine vision system, utilising a microscope lens system and sub-pixel localisation techniques, is used to provide feedback for the process, image processing techniques are presented which are shown to have a sensing resolution of 300 nm. Using these systems, workpieces are centred to within 500 nm. Tools are mounted on nanometre precise motion stages and motion and infeed are controlled. Tooling configurations with flat and tangential grinding surfaces are presented along with control and path generation algorithms. The capabilities and shortcomings of each are presented along with methods to predict appropriate feed rates based on experimental data. Both asymmetric and axisymmetric flat and curved micro-profiles have been produced on the tips of optical fibres using this system. These are presented and analysed and show that the system, as described, is capable of producing high quality micro-scale components with submicron dimensional accuracy and nanometric surface quality. The advantages of this technique are compared with other processes and discussed. Further development of the system and technique are also considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grinding machines</field><field name="subject">Grinding and polishing</field><field name="subject">Fiber optics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling, information capacity, and estimation of time-varying channels in mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Sadeghi, Parastoo, School of Electrical Engineering And Telecommunications, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the first part of this thesis, the information capacity of time-varying fading channels is analysed using finite-state Markov channel (FSMC) models. Both fading channel amplitude and fading channel phase are modelled as finite-state Markov processes. The effect of the number of fading channel gain partitions on the capacity is studied (from 2 to 128 partitions). It is observed that the FSMC capacity is saturated when the number of fading channel gain partitions is larger than 4 to 8 times the number of channel input levels. The rapid FSMC capacity saturation with a small number of fading channel gain partitions can be used for the design of computationally simple receivers, with a negligible loss in the capacity. Furthermore, the effect of fading channel memory order on the capacity is studied (from first- to fourth-order). It is observed that low-order FSMC models can provide higher capacity estimates for fading channels than high-order FSMC models, especially when channel states are poorly observable in the presence of channel noise. To explain the effect of memory order on the FSMC capacity, the capacities of high-order and low-order FSMC models are analytically compared. It is shown that the capacity difference is caused by two factors: 1) the channel entropy difference, and 2) the channel observability difference between the high-order and low-order FSMC models. Due to the existence of the second factor, the capacity of high-order FSMC models can be lower than the capacity of low-order FSMC models. Two sufficient conditions are proven to predict when the low-order FSMC capacity is higher or lower than the high-order FSMC capacity. In the second part of this thesis, a new implicit (blind) channel estimation method in time- varying fading channels is proposed. The information source emits bits ???0??? and ???1??? with unequal probabilities. The unbalanced source distribution is used as a priori known signal  structure at the receiver for channel estimation. Compared to pilot-symbol-assisted channel estimation, the proposed channel estimation technique can achieve a superior receiver bit error rate performance, especially at low signal to noise ratio conditions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Radio -- Transmitters and transmission-- Fading -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Adaptive signal processing -- Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative performance of alternative investment vehicles: hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTA funds</field><field name="creator">Madigele, Loago Thabang wa ga Mmamogapi, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the degree to which alternative funds deviate from their style-benchmark and how this is related to past performance and fund size, and how it impacts future risk and returns. Additionally the thesis examines how security selection and market timing skills differ across varying degrees of deviation from the benchmark. The thesis uses data for hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTA funds from the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets and employs fund???s tracking error relative to their style-benchmark to estimate the level of drift. The style-benchmarks used are the median return for all reporting funds that follow a particular style and funds are assigned a benchmark based on their self-reported style. First, this thesis documents statistically significant differences in the tracking errors of portfolios of funds with the highest tracking error versus funds with the lowest tracking error, implying that some managers drift from their self-reported style-benchmarks. Second, funds??? benchmark-inconsistency is less severe in the case of funds that have a regulatory obligation to disclose their performance, suggesting that the absence of regulation fosters an environment where managers can be more flexible with their investment approach. Third, the tendency to drift from the benchmark is most prevalent amongst funds with superior past performance as well as small funds. Fourth, future total portfolio risk increases as funds display more benchmarkinconsistency, suggesting that managers adopt riskier strategies as they attempt to enhance returns. Fifth, the thesis demonstrates that CTA funds that display drift from their benchmark produce higher absolute and relative returns in subsequent  periods regardless of the direction of the general market. In contrast, the findings show for hedge funds and funds of funds, benchmark-inconsistent funds are likely to outperform in bull markets and underperform in bear markets. Finally, this thesis shows that more benchmark-consistent managers have better security selection skill. The main contribution of this thesis is in identifying the group of hedge funds, funds of funds, and CTA funds that are likely to deviate from their self-reported style-benchmark and the risk-return consequences of such deviations. The findings have implications for investors and regulators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hedge funds -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Commodity trading advisors</field><field name="subject">Portfolio management</field><field name="subject">Investment analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Death among a cohort of prisoners in New South Wales Australia ??? a data linkage study</field><field name="creator">Kariminia, Azar, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines mortality rates among adults who experienced full-time imprisonment in New South Wales between January 1988 and December 2002, by record linkage to the Australian National Death Index. The cohort included 76383 men and 8820 women. Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 5137 deaths (4724 men, 423 women) were identified. Three hundred and three deaths (295 men, eight women) occurred in custody. The median age at death was 36.6 years for men and 32.7 years for women. The prominent causes of death were drug overdose, suicide, accidental and cardiovascular disease. The crude mortality rate was 797 per 100000 person-years for men and 685 per 100000 person-years for women. Risk of mortality was 3.7 times greater in male and 7.8 times greater in female prisoners than the standard population. The excess mortality was substantially raised following release from prison in both men (standardised mortality ratio 4.0 vs 1.7) and women (standardised mortality ratio 8.2 vs 2.1). The period of highest risk of death was the first two weeks after release. Drug overdose was the main cause of death, responsible for 68% of the deaths in the first two weeks for men and for 90% of the deaths in this period for women. In men, there was also a clustering of suicide directly after release. Prisoners admitted to prison psychiatric hospital, repeat offenders and those in the early stage of followup were at increased risk of mortality. Violent offenders were overrepresented in suicide figures and property offenders in death from overdose. Minority groups, in particular men, had a lower risk of death than white people. The above findings reinforce how disadvantaged prisoners are, measured by mortality as the most fundamental scale of human wellbeing. Prison represents a potential opportunity for treatment and public health intervention to address some of the health problems underlying the high mortality found in this study. The key challenge is, however, to provide a continuum of care between the prison and community.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prisoners -- New South Wales -- Mortality</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- New South Wales -- Death</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- New South Wales -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- Suicidal behavior -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Prisoners -- Rehabilitation -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional repression mechanisms of sporulation-specific genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Reodica, Mayfebelle, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">For organisms undergoing a developmental process it is ideal that specific genes are induced and repressed at the correct time and to the correct level in a coordinated manner. The process of meiosis and spore formation (collectively known as sporulation) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a convenient system to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms of gene repression and the contribution such repression mechanisms offer to cells capable of undergoing a developmental process. This thesis focuses on transcriptional repression of sporulation-specific genes during both vegetative/mitotic conditions and sporulation. The fitness contribution of transcriptional repressors that regulate sporulationspecific genes during vegetative growth were investigated considering the similarities between meiosis and mitosis such as DNA replication, chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Well-characterised sporulation genes of different functions were expressed in vegetative cells and ectopic expression of these genes was found not to be lethal. It was ascertained through strain competition studies that ectopic expression of the genes IME1, SMK1, SPR3 and DIT1 during mitotic growth did not affect cellular fitness. The expression of NDT80 in vegetative cells, however, caused a marked reduction in fitness and cells were also further compromised in the absence of the Sum1p repressor that regulates NDT80 transcription. The role of NDT80 as a transcriptional activator of middle sporulation genes, rather than the over-expression of NDT80 as a protein, caused the reduction of cell viability. Transcriptional regulation of the middle sporulation-specific gene SPR3 by the meiosis-specific Set3p repressor complex was investigated using synchronous sporulation cultures of the W303a/?? strain commonly used for sporulation studies. In a mutant W303a/?? ??set3/??set3 strain, lacking a key component of the Set3p repression complex, the transcription of SPR3 was uncharacteristically expressed at higher levels and derepressed during late sporulation. This SPR3 expression was consistent for both SPR3 transcript and SPR3::lacZ reporter protein studies. This preliminary work will enable future studies, using SPR3 promoter deletions fused to a lacZ reporter, aimed at determining the region of the SPR3 promoter that the Set3p complex may interact with to transcriptionally repress the gene during sporulation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetics</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Molecular genetics -- Technique</field><field name="subject">Genetics, Experimental</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aptamers to the hepatitis C virus polymerase</field><field name="creator">Jones, Louisa Alice School of Biotechnology And Biomolecular Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Treatments for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are currently only partially effective. Research into antivirals directed at HCV viral proteins are commonly based and tested on a single genotype, namely genotype 1. This is despite the high level of variability of the RNA virus and the frequency of infection with genotypes other than 1. The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) is a novel in vitro approach for the isolation of antiviral agents. SELEX allows rapid screening of vast nucleic acid libraries to isolate sequences (termed aptamers) that bind to target proteins with high affinity. The SELEX approach was used in the present study to isolate DNA aptamers to the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [non-structural protein B (NS5B)] protein of HCV subtype 3a, with the aim of inhibiting polymerase activity. Ten rounds of selection were performed using a Biacore 2000 and resultant aptamers cloned from rounds 2, 4, 8 and 10. Sequences of aptamers were aligned to elucidate common motifs and a proportion of the aptamers from rounds 8 and 10 (29/48) were screened for binding ability using the Biacore. The five ???best binding??? aptamers were investigated for inhibition of 3a polymerase activity in an in vitro polymerase assay. Two aptamers, r10/43 and r10/47, were chosen for further studies based on their ability to inhibit polymerase activity. The inhibition constants (Ki) of r10/43 and r10/47 were estimated to be 1.4 + 2.4 nM and 6.0 + 2.3 nM respectively. The affinity (Kd) of these aptamers for the 3a polymerase was estimated to be 1.3 + 0.3 nM (r10/43) and 23.5 + 6.7 nM (r10/47). The estimated inhibition and dissociation constants of these two aptamers are among the best for inhibitory aptamers of the HCV enzymes (polymerase and protease). Inhibition of HCV 3a polymerase appeared to be specific for r10/47, whilst r10/43 also had some inhibitory effect on norovirus and ??6 polymerase activity. This study is the first description of an inhibitor to the HCV subtype 3a polymerase that investigates genotypic specificity of targeted antivirals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular biology</field><field name="subject">RNA polymerases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physio-chemistry and rheology of Australian lentil flour and starch, and their implications for extrusion</field><field name="creator">Lee, Huang Chun, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Among three varieties of Australian lentils, Len culinaris, Matilda had larger physical dimensions and higher protein contents, but no significant difference in chemical composition or physical dimensions existed between Digger and Cobber. Optimum conditions for the extraction of lentil flours which passed through a 0.79 mm screen were pH 9.0 at 30??C for Matilda and pH 8.5 at 35??C for both Digger and Cobber. These conditions enable a high yield of lentil starches and proteins, with minimal changes or damage to their quality. Matilda offered advantages for processors over the other varieties: it had higher protein and fibre; lower lipid; and greater foam-forming capacity and foam stability. Its starch had higher Tg, lower Tm and better expansion behaviour.  All lentil starches were shear-thinning. The flow of the molten lentil starches under limited moisture content differed from starches sheared in excess moisture condition. When extruded, lentil starches offered good expansion and had higher Tg than did cereal starches in extruded products. The overall rheological behaviour of lentil flours differed from that of their corresponding starches. The lentil flours had poorer pasting quality and expansion possibly because of interference by their lipid and protein components. Starch rheological behaviour was greatly affected by the amylose/amylopectin ratio and the molecular weight of starches, while flour behaviour was more influenced by the interfering components.  The ?? value obtained from capillary rheometry (CR) could be used for the screening of materials for their expansion behaviour. The CR data gave excellent agreement to the results achieved from the extruder and in predicting the expansion indices and calculated viscosity of six flour blends. In all, the quantitative and qualitative knowledge on the physico-chemistry and rheology of lentils give a better understanding of the behaviour of lentil flours and starches in the expansion of extruded products, producing suitable end products with acceptable quality and storage stability. This project highlights the lentil flour and starch rheology characteristics in view of possible application in extruded products.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lentils -- Processing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and molecular aspects of HIV-associated lipodystrophy</field><field name="creator">Mallon, Patrick William Gerard, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">HIV-associated lipodystrophy (HIVLD) syndrome is a condition comprising abnormalities in distribution of body fat and metabolism of lipids and glucose that arises in HIV-infected patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy. This thesis describes clinical research into aspects of the natural history and treatment of HIVLD, as well as molecular research into its pathogenesis centred on subcutaneous adipose tissue. Results demonstrate HIVLD to be a treatment-induced syndrome characterised by initial gains in body fat followed by selective, progressive loss of limb fat. Exposure to thymidineanalogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tNRTI) induces lipoatrophy through mitochondrial dysfunction of which inhibition of mitochondrial RNA expression, rather than mitochondrial DNA depletion, is an early feature. Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with decreases in expression of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR??), an adipocyte transcription factor, which helps explain how tNRTI exposure leads to the loss of adipocyte function. Once established, lipoatrophy is characterised by mitochondrial DNA depletion, although this depletion occurs throughout the mitochondrial genome, suggesting an underlying cause other than inhibition of DNA polymerase gamma. HIVLD is a difficult syndrome to treat. Lipoatrophy is resistant to treatment with rosiglitazone, an agonist of PPAR??, which is ineffective in the setting of ongoing tNRTI therapy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Dyslipidaemia is also difficult to treat as use of pravastatin in the setting of ongoing exposure to protease inhibitors results in only modest declines in fasting cholesterol concentrations. Gains in central fat, such as that seen in patients with buffalo hump, are associated with insulin resistance and diabetes, but only occur in a relatively small percentage of treated patients, suggesting a role for  genetic factors in its development. Use of strategies such as avoidance of tNRTI in firstline ART, genetic screening to identify those at risk of toxicities and targeted selection of interventions in subgroups of affected patients, may help prevent this syndrome occurring and better treat those patients in which it has already occurred.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antiretroviral agents.</field><field name="subject">HIV infections -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Toxicology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33048</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution and phenotypic diversification in serratia marcescens biofilms.</field><field name="creator">Koh, Kai-Shyang, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The release of cells from a biofilm to the surrounding environment is poorly understood and the importance of this stage of biofilm development has only recently been realized. A key part of this process is the generation of phenotypic variants in the biofilm dispersal population. This thesis reports on the characterization of biofilm development of Serratia marcescens MG1, the analysis of the biofilm dispersal population, and the identification of the conditions that trigger phenotypic diversification. Furthermore, it provides an insight into the molecular understanding of how phenotypic variation is being generated, and demonstrates the clinical and environmental implications of phenotypic diversification during bacterial pathogenesis and bacterial persistence. Characterization of the microcolony biofilm development of S. marcescens revealed that the S. marcescens biofilm develops through a process involving microcolony formation, hollowing of mature microcolonies, and a sudden biofilm expansion within a very short period (&amp;lt 24h) resulting in an increase in biofilm biomass with a radiation of biofilm structures at days 3 to 4. The biofilm expansion phase consistently correlated to an increase in the number of dispersal variant morphotypes. Studies of variant induction in planktonic cultures and biofilm flow cells demonstrated that phenotypic diversification in S. marcescens is not only a biofilm-specific phenomenon, but also involves biofilm-specific morphotypes. These morphological variants can only be isolated from the microcolony biofilm morphotype and not from the filamentous biofilms, leading to the hypothesis that there is a strong diversifying selection that is specific to the microcolony biofilms. To further explore how these variants were generated, molecular analyses revealed that  exopolysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides are important moieties that are involved in phenotypic variation in S. marcescens biofilms. The etk gene, encoding a tyrosine protein kinase within the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis operon, was found to contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were present in the 'sticky' variants but not in the 'non-sticky' wild-type or the 'non sticky' small colony variants. Furthermore, infrequent-restriction-site PCR (IRS-PCR), BIOLOG metabolic profiling, and gene sequence analyses, suggest that phenotypic diversification in S. marcescens is likely to involve mutational hotspots in specific genes.  The biofilm-derived morphotypic variants differed extensively in cell ultrastructure properties, and exhibited specialized colonization and virulence traits, such as attachment, biofilm formation, swimming and swarming motilities, protease production, and hemolysin production. It was also demonstrated that phenotypic diversification contributed to a varying degree of resistance to protozoan predation, and bacterial pathogenecity in Caenorhabditis elegans, highlighting the complexity of the dispersal populations from S. marcescens biofilms. Furthermore, mixed-culture experiments involving multiple variant isolates (with or without the parental wild-type) showed that the persistence and virulence potential of S. marcescens can be synergistically enhanced in the Acanthamoeba castellanii grazing model and in the C. elegans infection model, respectively. This indicates that the different bacterial morphotypes work in concert to provide S. marcescens with enhanced protection against environmental perturbations and a competitive edge during the infection process. It was proposed that phenotypic diversification is not only an integral part of S. marcescens biofilm life-cycle, but also represents an important strategy for bacteria to greatly enhance its survival and persistence in different environments, ranging from aquatic and soil ecosystems, to those of the infected hosts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenotype.</field><field name="subject">Evolution (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Serratia marcescens.</field><field name="subject">Biofilms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological studies of sbs based interpenetrating polymer networks</field><field name="creator">Markotsis, Martin G., School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene (SBS) block copolymers and polystyrene (PS) were prepared using sequential network formation with the polybutadiene (PB) of the SBS crosslinked thermally and the styrene network formed thermally or by ??-radiation. The use of ??-radiation to cure the added PS network at room temperature successfully avoided thermal degradation of the butadiene segments within the SBS which had been observed in earlier studies. Both linear SBS and radial SB4 IPNs were studied to compare the influence of linear or branched block copolymers on the IPN morphology. The molecular morphology was examined using a suite of techniques including thermal analysis (DSC and DMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and smallangle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS). The primary SBS/SB4 network morphology was found to dominate the IPN morphology with the secondary styrene network limited to selectively swelling the PS domains. The linear SBS IPNs displayed a more ordered morphology than the radial SB4 IPNs, and this morphology was investigated in pseudo three-dimensions by sectioning samples in two perpendicular directions. The morphology was found to be consistent with thermally formed systems prepared in previous studies, and contained styrenic domains of 20-50 nm within a continuous butadiene matrix. The weight of evidence suggested that the lamella structure dominated the linear SBS IPNs and a cylindrical structure for the radial SB4 IPNs. Maximum values of tensile strength and elongation at break (20 MPa and 140% respectively) were observed in samples with a styrene cure ??-radiation dose of 200 kGy. The SANS analysis of these polymer systems was expanded to investigate the thermal formation of the added PS network in real time. Time-resolved SANS allowed the development of nanostructures in the bulk samples to be measured, and compared to previous time-independent TEM studies on thin sections. The formation of the styrene network was most noticeably observed in a linear SBS IPN system, in which an increase in long-range order was observed and attributed to movement of styrene monomer into the styrenic domains and sharpening of the phase boundaries between the PS and the PB regions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymers</field><field name="subject">Polymer networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and CFD simulation investigations into fouling reduction by gas-liquid two-phase flow for submerged flat sheet membranes</field><field name="creator">Ndinisa, Nkosinathi Vincent, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Submerged flat sheet membranes are mostly used in membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment. The major problems for these modules are concentration polarization and subsequent fouling. By using gas-liquid two-phase flow, these problems can be ameliorated. This thesis aimed to optimize the use of gas-liquid two-phase flow as a cleaning mechanism for submerged flat sheet membrane. The effect of various hydrodynamic factors such as airflow rate, nozzle size, nozzle geometry, intermittent bubbling, intermittent filtration, channel gap width, feed concentration and membrane baffles were investigated for model feed materials (yeast suspensions and mixed liquor from activated sludge plants). Insights into mechanisms by which two-phase flow reduces fouling for submerged flat sheet membranes were obtained by using Computational Fluid Dynamics. Experiments conducted showed that an optimal airflow rate exists beyond which no further flux enhancement was achieved. Fouling reduction increased with nozzle size at constant airflow. Nozzles of equal surface area but different geometries performed differently in terms of fouling reduction. Bubble size distribution analyses revealed that the percentage of larger bubbles and bubble rise velocities increased with the airflow rate and nozzle size. Thus the results of this study suggest that the effectiveness of two-phase flow depends on the bubble size. CFD simulations revealed that average shear stress on the membrane increased with airflow rate and bubble size and further indicated that an optimal bubble size possible exists. Using intermittent filtration as an operating strategy was found to be more beneficial than continuous filtration. This study also showed the importance of the size of the gap between the submerged flat sheet membranes. Increasing the gap from 7 mm to 14 mm resulted in an increase in fouling by about 40% based on the rate of increase in suction pressure (dTMP/dt). Finally, this is the first study which investigated the effect of baffles in improving air distribution across a submerged flat sheet membrane. It was found that baffles decreased the rate of fouling at least by a factor of 3.0 based on the dTMP/dt data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Two-phase flow</field><field name="subject">Membrance filters</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The single source chemical vapour deposition of alkaline earth metal oxide thin films</field><field name="creator">Hill, Matthew Roland, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal oxide thin films are dynamic materials that have revolutionised the nature of semiconductor and electronic thin film devices. Recently, progress has stagnated in some aspects due to the increasingly complex deposition apparatus required, and the dearth of suitable precursor complexes of certain ???difficult??? metals. This thesis seeks to address both of these issues. The application of a precursor complex, Mg6(O2CNEt2)12 to the SSCVD of MgO thin films delivered the highest quality films ever reported with this technique. The resultant films were found to be of purely (111) orientation. Due to the nature of the precursor, the chemical reactions occurring at the surface during SSCVD growth result in a high growth rate, low flux environment and films of (111) orientation have been achieved without the amorphous underlayer. This finding has important implications for buffer layers in perovskite thin film devices. The unprecedented precursor chemistry has been used as a basis for the extremely high quality material produced, along with the unusual, yet beneficial structural morphology it possesses. A new range of barium complexes with single encapsulating ligands have been prepared for use in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of BaTiO3 thin films. A novel pathway to an unprecedented class of barium carbamates is reported, and also new dianionic bis ??-ketoesterates and their barium, strontium, and calcium analogues were synthesised. High resolution mass spectrometry showed the barium bis ??-ketoesterate derivatives to be monomeric, and preliminary testing indicated some volatility in these species. Insights were gained into the likely successful pathways to building a volatile heterobimetallic precursor complex containing an alkaline earth metal. The knowledge of intimate mixing in heterobimetallic precursor complexes was extended by some novel chemistry to develop the first mixed Zn/Mg carbamato cluster complexes. These complexes were found to be excellent SSCVD precursors for ZnxMg1-xO thin films. Thin films were deposited with these precursors and exhibited a single preferred orientation, with a constant amount of magnesium throughout the bulk of the films. Investigation of the light emission properties of the films revealed significant improvements in the structural order commensurate with the incorporation of magnesium, and the formation of the ZnxMg1-xO alloy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metal oxide semiconductors -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Chemical vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Alkaline earth metals</field><field name="subject">Thin films -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogeology, hydrochemistry and isotope hydrology of Palm Valley, Central Australia</field><field name="creator">Wischusen, John David Henry, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Palm Valley oasis in arid central Australia is characterised by stands of palm trees (Livistona mariae). How these unique plants, separated by nearly a 1000 kilometres of arid country from their nearest relatives persist, has long fascinated visitors. Defining the hydrogeology of the Hermannsburg Sandstone, a regionally extensive and thick Devonian sequence of the Amadeus Basin that underlies Palm Valley, is the major thrust of investigation. Appraisal of drilling data shows this aquifer to be a dual porosity fractured rock aquifer which, on a regional scale, behaves as a low permeability, hydraulically continuous resource. Groundwater is low salinity (TDS &amp;lt1000 mg/L) and bicarbonate rich. Slight variations in cation chemistry indicate different flow paths with separate geochemical histories have been sampled. Stable isotope (????H, ???????O) results from Palm Valley show groundwater to have a uniform composition that plots on or near a local meteoric water line. Radiocarbon results are observed to vary from effectively dead (&amp;lt 4%) to 87 % modern carbon. To resolve groundwater age beyond the radiocarbon window the long lived radioisotope 36Cl was also used. Ratios of 36Cl/Cl range from 130 to 290 x 10-15. In this region atmospheric 36Cl/Cl ratio is around 300 x 10-15. Thus an age range of around 300 ka is indicated if, as is apparent, radioactive decay is the only significant cause of 36Cl/Cl variation within the aquifer. A review of previous, often controversial, 36Cl decay studies shows results are usually ambiguous due to lack of certainty when factoring subsurface Cl- addition into decay calculations. Apparently, due to the thickness of the Hermannsburg Sandstone, no subsurface sources of Cl- such as aquitards or halites, are encountered along groundwater flow paths, hence the clear 36Cl decay trend seen. The classic homogenous aquifer with varying surface topography, the &amp;quotToth&amp;quot flow model, is the simplest conceptual model that need be invoked to explain these isotope data. Complexities, associated with local topography flow cells superimposed on the regional gradient, signify groundwater with markedly different flow path lengths has been sampled. The long travel times (&amp;gt 100 ka) indicate groundwater discharge would endure through arid phases associated with Quaternary climate oscillations. Such a flow system can explain the persistence of this arid zone groundwater-dependent ecosystem and highlight the possibility that Palm Valley has acted as a flora refuge since at least the mid- Pleistocene.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrogeology</field><field name="subject">Water chemistry</field><field name="subject">Radioisotopes in hydrology</field><field name="subject">Hydrology -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cultural reinvention of planning</field><field name="creator">Young, Gregory, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Culture is expanding and has greater weight and explanatory potential in our culturalised age. Following the earlier literature of the ???cultural turn???, culture is now perceived as ubiquitous in society, the economy, and theory, and with the capacity to intervene on itself. Further, it may be seen to characterise both the nature and the progressive potential of a range of contemporary social and intellectual technologies such as planning, education, health, and organisational development.  While this general process of ???culturalisation??? proceeds apace, the capacity of culture to act as an organising idea and category for sectors such as planning is still largely underdeveloped, most particularly in planning itself. A new Culturised Model for planning that is reflexive and ethical is proposed. Differentiated from the trend to culturalisation and its association with commodification, ???culturisation??? has true sustainable and transformational potential.  The thesis consists of three main parts ??? each of three chapters - with a substantial scenesetting Introduction and a Conclusion. Part One examines culture and planning, Part Two develops a new Culturised Model for planning, and Part Three illustrates the Model.  In Part One the grounds of culturisation are prepared by: 1) describing our culturalised age; 2) developing a new positionality for planning; 3) presenting a critical analysis of neomodern and postmodern planning theory; and 4) outlining an original history of culture and planning in the 20th and 21st centuries.  In Part Two a practical Culturised Model for planning is developed, based on the three elements of 1) principles for culture; 2) a planner???s ???literacy trinity???; and 3) a methodology. The Model employs an integrated concept of culture and an integrated approach to research, and is applicable to the full spectrum of planning forms, scales and purposes. In Part Three the Culturised Model is illustrated in principle through a range of global examples, and in specific terms, for two major Australian places. The first study illustrates culture and urban and regional planning for metropolitan Sydney, NSW, at four nested geographical scales. The second illustrates strategic planning in its aspatial form for the Port Arthur Historic Site, in Tasmania, a major international convict heritage site proposed for UNESCO World Heritage listing.  The thesis represents an original multi-dimensional synthesis on culture and planning. It also presents a ???breakthrough??? paradigm for the sustainable integration of culture in planning, previously only foreshadowed in the planning literature, and developed in randomised practices internationally.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model studies of the cub-histidine-tyrosine centre in cytochrome c oxidase</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sang Tae, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the synthesis and copper coordination chemistry of covalently-linked aryl-imidazole derivatives designed as models for the crosslinked imidazole-phenol sidechains of the His-Tyr cofactor in the CcO. Three new imidazole- (HL1 - HL3) and three new indole- (HL4 - H2L6) containing tripodal ligands were synthesised. The conjugate addition of an imidazole to activated quinone derivatives was developed as a new route to organic models for the Tyr His cofactor. Two monodentate imidazole-aryl, Im-hq(OH)2 and Im-ArOH, and an imidazole-quinone, Im bq were obtained using this route. The X-ray crystal structure of Im-hq(OH)2.EtOH was determined. The route was also used to give new chelating ligands, H2L10 and HL12, containing a cross-linked imidazole-phenol surrogate for the Tyr244-His240 cofactor.            Copper complexes of Im-hq(OH)2, Im-bq, Im-ArOH, H2L10-HL12, and HL1-H2L6 were prepared, and the X-ray crystal structures of [Cu(terpy)(Im-bq)][BF4]2 and five other copper complexes were determined. The physiochemical properties of the copper complexes were characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis-NIR, EPR and (spectro)electrochemical studies. Key results include: the oxidation of Im-ArO- anion affords the semiquinone radical, Im-sq(4OH)(1O??????), in a hydrous solvent. However, the oxidations of neutral Im-ArOH and [Cu(tpa)(Im-ArOH)]2+ produce the corresponding phenoxy radical species that rapidly and reversibly dimerise to give quinol cyclohexadienone, QCHD, dimers. Significantly [Cu(tpa)(Im-sq(4OH)(1O??????))]2+ was EPR silent, perhaps due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the Cu(II) (S=1/2)  and semiquinonyl radical (S=1/2) centres. Deprotonation of the hydroquinone in [Cu(tpa)(Im-hq(OH)2]2+ produces the hydroquinone dianion which reduces the Cu(II) centre. The semiquinone radical is coordinatively labile and dissociates from the Cu(I) centre.

The mutants fell into two groups based on their responses to acute and chronic doses of H2O2. Transcription factors Yap1p, Skn7p and Gal11p were important for both acute and chronic responses to H2O2. Yap1p and Skn7p were needed for up-regulation of anti-oxidant functions rather than generation of NADPH or glutathione. Adaptation was reduced in strains deleted for GPX3 and YBP1, which are involved in sensing H2O2 and activating Yap1p, but to a lesser extent than YAP1 deletion. RPE1, TKL1 and IDP1 deletants affected in NADPH production were chronically sensitive to H2O2, but resistant to an acute dose and other mutants affected in NADPH generation were also affected in adaptation. These mutants overproduced reduced glutathione (GSH) but maintained normal cellular redox homeostasis. Over-production of GSH was not regulated by transcription of the gene encoding -glutamylcysteine-synthetase. The Skn7p transcription factor is therefore important for the adaptive response to oxidative stress-induced by H2O2, and NADPH generation is also required for adaptation.  The roles of sumoylation in stress responses and transcriptional regulation were examined by deleting the SUMO ligases Siz1p and Siz2p. Siz1p is required for tolerance to copper ions and DNA damage repair. Siz2p is involved in repression of stress responses, particularly oxidative stress and is required for activation of nucleotide and RNA metabolism, DNA processing and cell division. Both Siz1p and Siz2p act in parallel in the repressing heat-shock responses and in reducing chronological life span. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis showed that Siz1p and Siz2p repress the mitochondrial retrograde pathway and arginine biosynthesis, while activating some carbon and nitrogen metabolism genes. Sumoylation of proteins in the wild type was induced by nitrogen starvation or mitochondrial inhibition during the initial treatment. However, nitrogen starvation led to some protein degradation, while the SUMO-conjugated proteins were recycled in cells with disrupted mitochondrial functions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- Biotechnology.</field><field name="subject">Oxidation, Physiological.</field><field name="subject">Stress (Physiology).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trauma nursing case management: impact on patient outcomes</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Kathleen Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aim The purpose of the study was to formally identify trauma care delivery problems at the study institution, implement a solution in the form of trauma case management (TCM), and measure the effect of TCM on staff satisfaction, clinical coding accuracy and patient outcomes, using practice-specific outcome variables such as in-hospital complication rates, length of stay, resource use and allied health service intervention rates. This research also aimed to make a unique contribution to the international trauma literature by addressing the lack of any evidence specifically measuring the impact of trauma case management intervention. Methods St George Hospital is a 600 bed urban Teaching Hospital of the University of NSW. It is a designated Trauma Centre, seeing around 200 severely injured patients and around 2500 injury admissions per year. A series of focus groups and a staff satisfaction survey identified perceived problems associated with trauma care, and a trauma case management program was implemented. A preliminary study was conducted with positive results and funding was obtained to provide TCM seven days a week to all trauma patient admissions. A larger clinical trial was conducted and data from 754 patients were collected over fourteen months after TCM was introduced at the study hospital. These data were compared with 777 matched patients from the previous 14 months as a control group. An audit was conducted on trauma patient clinical coding using the daily progress record kept by the trauma case manager. The data were analysed with SPSS. The statistical tests used were Mann-Whitney U, chi-squared (2) logistic regression and generalised linear models. Results Focus groups and the staff satisfaction survey identified communication and coordination as the main problems associated with trauma care delivery. Following the initial implementation of the program, staff support for TCM was overwhelming. TCM greatly improved the rate of and time to Allied Health intervention (p&amp;lt0.0001). Results demonstrated a decrease in the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis (p&amp;lt0.038), coagulopathy (p=0.041) and respiratory failure. A reduced hospital length of stay (LOS), particularly in the paediatric (p&amp;lt0.05) and 45 - 64 years age group was noted. There were 6621 fewer pathology tests performed (p&amp;lt0.0001) and the total number of bed days was 483 days less than predicted from the control group. Many hospital clinical coding errors and omissions were highlighted by the TCM record comparison. The use of TCM records resulted in Twenty eight percent of recoded records having their Australian national diagnostic related group (AN-DRG) changed, which resulted in the identification over $39,000 in unidentified funding. Conclusion TCM improves staff satisfaction, communication and clinical coding accuracy. The introduction of TCM improved the efficiency and effectiveness of trauma patient care in our institution. This initiative demonstrates that TCM results in improvements to quality of care, trauma patient morbidity, financial performance and resource use.

This project was made possible with the synthesis of a series of lengths of ferrocene derived alkanethiols, a series of lengths of ferrocene derived norbornylogous bridges and a series of lengths of anthraquinone derived norbornylogous bridges. The series of ferrocene derived alkanethiols were used to study the effect of gradually varying the polarity of the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) surface on the standard electron transfer rate constant and formal potential. This was achieved by varying the portion of hydroxyl to methyl terminated alkanethiol diluent in the SAM preparation step. It was found that the formal potential increased with a decreasing proportion of hydroxyl terminated diluent and increasing length of the diluent. For pure hydroxyl terminated diluent the formal potential was relatively independent of length. It was found that the rate constant increased for short alkane chain lengths with decreasing proportion of hydroxyl terminated diluent. However, it decreased in magnitude with long alkane chain lengths for low proportions of hydroxyl terminated diluent. The norbornylogous bridges were shown to stand proud above the diluent with a similar tilt angle as the alkanethiol diluent. The ferrocene derived norbornylogous bridges showed hydroxyl terminated monolayers had a slower rate constant then methyl terminated diluents independent of length and that it is highly probable that an alkane bridged redox moiety is located very close to the surface of the monolayer. SAMs were created with the ferrocene of the ferrocene derived norbornylogous bridges located at various heights above the monolayers surface. This was done by using various lengths of hydroxyl terminated diluent. It was found that the rate constant and the formal potential decreased with height above the surface. Interfacial potential distribution was used to account for this and to estimate a ??true?? formal potential. The anthraquinone derived norbornylogous bridges were tested at various pH values and heights above the surface. It was found that an accurate estimate for the electron transfer mechanism can not be made for surface bound species due to the effects of interfacial potential distribution.

Insulin for the management of diabetic symptoms is an ideal candidate for re-engineering.  Current subcutaneous therapy results in low patient compliance and is ineffective in meeting the physiological need for post-prandial insulin.  Implementation of dose titration for more efficient blood-glucose management is also inconvenient and uncomfortable.  Inhaled insulin is presented as a superior alternative to current therapy.  The lungs offer excellent access to the circulatory system.  Aerosols suspended in inspired air may deposit on lung epithelia and be available for systemic absorption.  To evade the defense mechanism of the human respiratory tract, particle sizes have traditionally been minimized to achieve necessary aerosol performance.  Recent developments indicate that more efficient performance augmentation may also be achieved by decreasing the bulk density of powders and modifying surface characteristics.  Light and fluffy powders with rough surfaces experience much higher drag forces within an airstream.  The Atomized Rapid Injection for Solvent Extraction (ARISE) process is a unique precipitation platform devised by incorporating a rapid injection technique for energetic solution delivery into supercritical fluid (SCF) media to effect recovery of previously dissolved pharmaceutical compounds.  The quasi-instantaneous delivery of solutions alleviates the drawbacks of the use of capillary nozzles or micro-orifices, gradual elution and mixing controlled precipitation kinetics in existing SCF precipitation techniques.  Most importantly, the energetic release of solution into SCF media effects supersaturation over a much larger spatial volume and promotes the homogeneous precipitation of low bulk density powders.  ARISE processed insulin powders displayed characteristics that were highly influenced by anti-solvent conditions and powders of different qualities were obtained as a function of anti-solvent pressures.  At lower anti-solvent pressures, powders of narrow particle size distribution were achieved, an indication of homogeneous supersaturation levels within processing.  Span, the index of size distribution was as low as 0.991.  At higher anti-solvent pressures, supersaturation rates were increased while mixing efficiencies decreased, resulting in powders of wider size distribution, and powder bulk densities as low as 0.01 g/ml.  Low bulk density insulin displayed in-vitro respirable fractions as high as 78%.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particle Inhalation Technology</field><field name="subject">Supercritical Fluid Technology</field><field name="subject">ARISE Technology</field><field name="subject">Particle Design</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical technology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping children's theory of critical meaning in visual arts</field><field name="creator">Maras, Karen Elizabeth, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Through the lens of a realist conception of artworks as artefacts, this research investigates the underlying ontological constraints governing children&#146;s aesthetic understanding in art. Challenging structural conventions of research into aesthetic development in art, a realist philosophical framework provides a neutral space within which the ontological basis for children's aesthetic concepts of pictorial meaning and value can be analysed, and developmental differences mapped. The study employs an analytical schema which brings together analytical tools borrowed from Feldman's &#145;ontic dumping&#146; and Wollheim's twofolded &#145;seeing-in.&#146; This schema is used to classify qualitative changes in concepts of pictorial value and meaning in three groups of children aged 6, 9, and 12, and two teachers, as employed in the experimental curation of an exhibition of portrait paintings. The curatorial policy developed by children from each group, in justification of their choice of eight pictures and accompanying exhibitions, are interpreted using quantitative and qualitative methods. Characteristic-to-defining shifts from na??ve accounts to more autonomous aesthetic judgements of value are identified relative to the ontological stance children adopted in their critical reasoning about the portraits they chose. Findings include differences in the level of conceptual integration in justification of portraits chosen, differences in the breadth and autonomy of identity brought to bear in choices of portraits, but few differences in the representational abstraction of the images chosen by different age groups. The authenticity of the experimental tasks, as well as the rich characterisation of the developmental differences described in the study have significance for pedagogical explanations of critical practice in art education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On and off-axis monochromatic aberrations and myopia in young children</field><field name="creator">Martinez, Aldo A., Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To study ???on??? and ???off-axis??? wavefront aberration of eyes of children and to determine the relationship with refractive error development.  Methods: On and off-axis ocular aberrations of cyclopleged eyes of children (mostly 12 year olds) were measured and compared to data obtained from a group of mostly 6 year old children. Only data from the right eyes were analysed (pupil diameter=5 mm) and categorised into refractive error groups based on ???M???. Differences in ???on??? and ???off-axis??? aberrations between refractive and ethnic groups were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses of variance with adjustment for multiple comparisons. Off-axis refraction was analysed using skiagrams and mean relative spherical equivalent.  Results: Data from 1,636 12 year old children (mean age 12.6 ?? 0.4 years) was analysed. Lower order aberrations were the largest and higher order aberrations contributed to only 25% of the wavefront. There were no differences in the amount of total higher orders between refractive groups. Of the individual higher orders, spherical aberration was greater in hyperopic eyes (0.07 ?? 0.06 ??m) in comparison to emmetropic and myopic eyes (0.05 ?? 0.04 ??m and 0.05 ?? 0.04 ??m) (p&lt;0.001). Myopic eyes had more positive values of Z(3,-1) (p&lt;0.05). Similar results were obtained for the 1,364 6 year old children (mean age 6.7 ??? 0.4 years). Despite East Asian children being more myopic than other ethnic groups (p&lt;0.01), there were no differences in higher orders except for low hyperopic East Asian eyes presenting with higher levels of positive spherical aberrations (p&lt;0.001). When compared to the fovea, off-axis myopic eyes had hyperopia (0.55 to 1.66 D) and emmetropes and hyperopes had myopia (0.10 to -2.00 D). Astigmatism and defocus were the dominant off-axis aberrations. The magnitude of higher order aberrations (mostly 3rd orders) increased with eccentricity but was similar across refractive error groups.  Conclusions: Myopic eyes do not have abnormal or excessive levels of on and off-axis higher order aberrations but had patterns of off-axis refraction that may be associated with progression. Considerable inter-subject variability in higher order aberrations was seen for all refractive groups. However, their magnitude was small and suggests that any impact on the optical quality of the eye is negligible.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peripheral Refraction</field><field name="subject">Myopia</field><field name="subject">Monochromatic Aberrations</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Sydney Myopia Study</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy-driven framework for manageable and adaptive service-oriented processes</field><field name="creator">Erradi, Abdelkarim, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dynamic selection and composition of autonomous and loosely-coupled Web services is increasingly used to automate business processes. The typical long-running characteristic of business processes imposes new management challenges such as dynamic adaptation of running process instances. However, current process orchestration engines provide limited flexibility to dynamically adapt to changing runtime conditions (e.g., presence of faults). Additionally, current process specification languages exhibit some limitations regarding modularity of crosscutting management concerns. In particular, monitoring and adaptation logic is often scattered across several process definitions and intertwined with the business logic. This leads to monolithic and complex processes that are hard to understand, reuse, maintain, and evolve. To address these limitations, we developed a policy-based change management framework, named Manageable and Adaptable Service Compositions (MASC), to declaratively express crosscutting monitoring and process adaptation concerns in a separate and modular way. MASC policies use a set of simple, but flexible and relatively powerful, constructs to declaratively specify policies that govern: (1) discovery and selection of services to be used, (2) monitoring to detect the need for adaptation, (3) reconfiguration and adaptation of the process to handle special cases (e.g., context-dependant behaviour) and recover from typical faults in service-based processes. The identified constructs are executed by a lightweight service-oriented management middleware named MASC middleware. The adaptation is transparent because it preserves the original functional behaviour of the business process and does not tangle the adaptation logic with that of the business process. Additionally, policies do not have to be necessarily defined when designing the process; they can also be introduced later during deployment or at runtime. We implemented a MASC proof-of-concept prototype and evaluated it on Stock Trading case study scenarios. We conducted extensive studies to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed techniques and illustrate the benefits of our approach in providing adaptive composite services using the policy-based approach. Our performance and scalability studies indicate that MASC middleware is scalable and the introduced overhead are acceptable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MASC Middleware</field><field name="subject">Manageable and Adaptive Web Services</field><field name="subject">Policy-Driven Framework for Web services management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery and adaptation of process views</field><field name="creator">Motahari Nezhad, Hamid Reza, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Business process analysis and integration are key endeavours for today's enterprises. Recently, Web services have been widely adopted for the implementation and integration of business processes within and across enterprises. In this dissertation, we investigate the problem of enabling the analysis of service interactions, in today's enterprises, in the context of business process executions, and that of service integration. Our study shows that only fraction of interactions in the enterprise are supported by process-aware systems. However, enabling above-mentioned analyses requires: (i)  a model of the underlying business process to be used as a reference for the analysis, and (ii) the ability to correlate events generated during service interactions into process instances. We refer to a process model and the corresponding process instances as a "process view". We propose the concept of process space to refer to all process related information sources in the enterprise, over which various process views are defined.  We propose the design and development of a system called "process space discovery system" (PSDS) for discovering process views in a process space. We introduce novel approaches for the correlation of events into process instances, focusing on the public processes of Web services (business protocols), and also for the discovery of the business protocol models from the process instances of a process view.  Analysis of service integration approaches shows that while standardisation in Web services simplifies the integration in the communication level, at the higher levels of abstractions (e.g., services interfaces and protocol models) services are still open to heterogeneities. We characterise the mismatches between service interfaces and protocol specifications and introduce "mismatch patterns" to represent them. A mismatch pattern also includes an adapter template that aims at the resolution of the captured mismatch. We also propose semi-automated approaches for identifying the mismatches between interface and protocol specifications of two services. The proposed approaches have been implemented in prototype tools, and experimentally validated on synthetic and real-world datasets. The discovered process views, using PSDS, can be used to perform various analyses in an enterprise, and the proposed adaptation approach facilitates the adoption of Web services in business process integration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web services integration.</field><field name="subject">Business processes.</field><field name="subject">Service oriented computing.</field><field name="subject">Business process discovery.</field><field name="subject">Web services adaptation.</field><field name="subject">Events correlations in business processes.</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises.</field><field name="subject">Correlation (Statistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutions and decentralised urban water management</field><field name="creator">Livingston, Daniel John, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Physically decentralised water management systems may contribute to improving the sustainability of urban water management. Any shift toward decentralised systems needs to consider not just physical system design but also social values, knowledge frames, and organisations, and their interconnections to the physical technology.  Four cases of recent Australian urban water management improvement projects were researched using qualitative methods. Three cases were of decentralised water management innovation. The other was of a centralised system, although decentralised options had been considered. These cases were studied to identify institutional barriers and enablers for the uptake of decentralised systems, and to better understand how emerging environmental engineering knowledge might be applied to overcome an implementation gap for decentralised urban water technologies.  Analysis of each case focused on the institutional elements of urban water management, namely: the values, knowledge frames and organisational structures. These elements were identified through in-depth interviews, document review, and an on-line survey. The alignment of these elements was identified as being a significant contributor to the stability of centralised systems, or to change toward decentralised systems.  A new organisational home for innovative knowledge was found to be common to each case where decentralised innovation occurred. ??Institutional entrepreneurs??, strong stakeholder engagement, and inter-organisational networks were all found to be linked to the creation of shared meaning and legitimacy for organisational and technological change.  Existing planning frameworks focus on expert justification for change rather than institutional support for change. Institutional factors include shared understandings, values and organisational frameworks, and the alignment of each factor. Principles for, and examples of, appropriate organisational design for enabling and managing decentralised technological innovation for urban water management are proposed.  This research contributes to the understanding of the institutional basis and dynamics of urban water management, particularly in relation to physical centralisation and decentralisation of urban water management technologies and, to a lesser extent, in relation to user involvement in urban water management. Understanding of factors that contribute to enabling and constraining decentralised technologies is extended to include institutional and organisational factors. New and practical pathways for change for the implementation of decentralised urban water systems are provided.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">institutions</field><field name="subject">urban water management</field><field name="subject">decentralised</field><field name="subject">sustainable water management</field><field name="subject">decentralisation</field><field name="subject">institionalisation</field><field name="subject">Water-supply -- Australia -- Management</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="subject">Water quality management</field><field name="subject">Water resources development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some antecedents of Leibniz's principles</field><field name="creator">Castro, Martinho Antonio Bittencourt de, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Leibniz considered that scepticism and confusion engendered by the disputes of different sects or schools of metaphysics were obstacles to the progress of knowledge in philosophy. His solution was to adopt an eclectic method with the aim of uncovering the truth hidden beneath the dispute of schools. Leibniz's project was, having in mind the eclectic method, to synthesise a union between old pre-modern philosophy, based on formal and final causes, and new modern philosophy which gave preference to efficient causes. The result of his efforts is summarised in the Monadology. But the question remains: to what degree was Leibniz successful in this enterprise? An objective of this thesis is to investigate whether philosophical tradition can justify or support some of the arguments that are at the basis of Leibniz's system (for example, monads have no window to the exterior world, a phrase that summarises the structure of Monadology). I shall demonstrate how Leibniz reflects the concerns and the positions of his key predecessors. Thus, the aim of the thesis is to explore key antecedents to Leibniz's central doctrines. The thesis argues that Leibniz carried out a logical development of some principles in the eclectic system of Plotinus, which resulted in the structure of Monadology. Whether Leibniz's project was successful or not will depend on how we view those principles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monadology.</field><field name="subject">Leibniz.</field><field name="subject">History of philosophy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrazine in late transition metal-mediated N-C bond formation</field><field name="creator">Dabb, Serin Lloyd, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the metal-mediated formation of nitrogen-carbon bonds from hydrazines and alkynes. Rh, Ir, Ru and Os metal complexes containing bidentate P,N- and N,N-donor ligands were all studied during the course of this work.  A series of stereoisomers of metal complexes of general formula MCl2(PyP)2 (where M = Ru and Os, PyP = 1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl)pyrazole) (2.01-2.05) were synthesised. The isomerisation process of complexes 2.01-2.05 in solution was investigated. The ruthenium complex RuCl2(CO)(&#61547;1-P-PyP)(&#61547;2-P,N-PyP) (2.14), which contains one pendant PyP ligand bound through the P-donor ligand was synthesised, confirming the potential hemilability of the mixed P,N-donor ligand PyP.  Chloride abstraction from the ruthenium complex trans,cis,cis-RuCl2(PyP)2 (2.01) was achieved using either a sodium or silver salt to yield the dimeric complexes of general formula [Ru(&#956;-Cl)(PyP)2]2[X]2 (where M = Ru, X = OSO2CF3 (2.06), BF4 (2.07), BPh4 (2.08), and BArF 2.09). [Os(&#956;-Cl)(PyP)2]2[BPh4]2 (2.10) was synthesised from sodium tetraphenylborate and trans,cis,cis-OsCl2(PyP)2 (2.04).  The reactivity of dimeric complexes 2.06 and 2.08 towards substituted hydrazines was investigated. The methylhydrazine complex [Ru(PyP)2(NH2NHMe)][Cl][BPh4] (3.12) was synthesised. The methylhydrazine adduct of 3.12 binds to the metal centre in an end-on fashion via the NH2 group in solution, and in a bidentate fashion in the solid-state. This is the first reported example of a ruthenium complex containing a bidentate hydrazine ligand.  The ruthenium-vinylidene complexes [RuCl(Me2PyP)2(=C=C(H)Ph)]BPh4 (4.15) and [RuCl(Me2PyP)2(=C=C(H)n-Bu)]BPh4 (4.16) (Me2PyP = 1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)ethyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole) were synthesised from trans,cis,cis-RuCl2(Me2PyP)2 (4.10) and the appropriate terminal alkyne. The reaction of alkynes with ruthenium complexes containing the PyP ligand was also investigated. Nitrogen-carbon bond formation was achieved through reaction of mono-substituted hydrazines with 4.06 and 4.07 to yield complexes of general formula [RuCl(&#61547;1-P-Me2PyP)(&#61547;2-P,N-Me2PyP)(&#61547;2-N,C-(NH2N(R2)C(CH2R1)]BPh4 (where R1 = R2 = Ph (4.19), R1= Ph, R2 = Me (4.20), R1 = n-Bu, R2 = Ph, (4.21) or R1 = n-Bu, R2 = Me (4.22)). The mechanism of the formation of the stable metallocyclic complexes 4.19-4.22 was elucidated through studies of the reactivity of 4.15 towards a series of amines and hydrazines and relies on the labile nature of the N-donor of the P,N-donor ligand Me2PyP. A method for the synthesis of triflate complexes of rhodium Rh(PyP)(CO)(OSO2CF3) (5.13) and Rh(PyPhP)(CO)(OSO2CF3) (PyPhP = 1-(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)pyrazole) (5.14) from rhodium chloride complexes was developed. The solid-state structure of rhodium triflate complex 5.14, which contained the more sterically rigid ligand PyPhP, exhibited a much greater distortion from the ideal square planar geometry than the rhodium analogue 5.13 which contains the PyP ligand. The triflate group of 5.13 and 5.14 was displaced by substituted hydrazines to yield new hydrazine complexes of rhodium. A series of Rh and Ir complexes with bidentate P,N- and N,N-donor ligands were found to catalyse the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes with hydrazines. [Ir(bpm)(CO)2]BArF (6.08) was found to be the most efficient catalyst of those studies for this transformation, and was amongst the most efficient catalysts reported to date for this transformation. The influence of counter-ion was highly significant in the catalysed intermolecular hydroamination reaction. The substrate scope of the intermolecular hydroamination of alkynes with hydrazines was investigated using [Ir(bpm)(CO)2]BArF (6.08) as the catalyst.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrazine</field><field name="subject">Alkynes</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen -- Chemistry</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41428</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology mapping: a logic-based approach with applications in selected domains</field><field name="creator">Wong, Alfred Ka Yiu, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In advent of the Semantic Web and recent standardization efforts, Ontology has quickly become a popular and core semantic technology. Ontology is seen as a solution provider to knowledge based systems. It facilitates tasks such as knowledge sharing, reuse and intelligent processing by computer agents. A key problem addressed by Ontology is the semantic interoperability problem. Interoperability in general is a common problem in different domain applications and semantic interoperability is the hardest and an ongoing research problem. It is required for systems to exchange knowledge and having the meaning of the knowledge accurately and automatically interpreted by the receiving systems. The innovation is to allow knowledge to be consumed and used accurately in a way that is not foreseen by the original creator. While Ontology promotes semantic interoperability across systems by unifying their knowledge bases through consensual understanding, common engineering and processing practices, it does not solve the semantic interoperability problem at the global level. As individuals are increasingly empowered with tools, ontologies will eventually be created more easily and rapidly at a near individual scale. Global semantic interoperability between heterogeneous ontologies created by small groups of individuals will then be required.	Ontology mapping is a mechanism for providing semantic bridges between ontologies. While ontology mapping promotes semantic interoperability across ontologies, it is seen as the solution provider to the global semantic interoperability problem. However, there is no single ontology mapping solution that caters for all problem scenarios. Different applications would require different mapping techniques.	In this thesis, we analyze the relations between ontology, semantic interoperability and ontology mapping, and promote an ontology-based semantic interoperability solution. We propose a novel ontology mapping approach namely, OntoMogic. It is based on first order logic and model theory. OntoMogic supports approximate mapping and produces structures (approximate entity correspondence) that represent alignment results between concepts. OntoMogic has been implemented as a coherent system and is applied in different application scenarios. We present case studies in the network configuration, security intrusion detection and IT governance &amp; compliance management domain. The full process of ontology engineering to mapping has been demonstrated to promote ontology-based semantic interoperability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic interoperability</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">ontology mapping</field><field name="subject">compliance management</field><field name="subject">network management</field><field name="subject">network security intrusion detection</field><field name="subject">network configuration management</field><field name="subject">integrated network management</field><field name="subject">Mappings (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tetrahydrofolate and iron-sulfur metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Gelling, Cristy Lee, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tetrahydrofolate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is required for the biosynthesis of many central metabolites, including some amino acids, nucleobases, and nucleotides, and hence dysfunction of one-carbon metabolism is associated with many human diseases and disorders.  The mitochondrial glycine decarboxylase complex (GDC) is an important component of one-carbon metabolism, generating 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-H??4folate) from glycine.  Previous work has shown that the genes encoding the unique sub-units of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GDC (GCV1, GCV2 and GCV3) are regulated in response to changes in the levels of cytosolic 5,10-CH2-H??4folate (Piper et al., 2000).  Given the centrality of 5,10-CH2-H??4folate to many aspects of metabolism, it was hypothesised that other genes may be regulated by the same mechanism. Using microarray analysis of S. cerevisiae under a number of conditions that affect 5,10-CH2-H??4folate levels, the ??one-carbon regulon??, a group of genes that were co-regulated with the GCV genes was identified.  The one-carbon regulon corresponds closely to genes whose promoters are bound by the purine biosynthesis regulator Bas1p, but not all one-carbon regulon members are significantly purine regulated.  Genetic approaches demonstrated that the one-carbon unit response and the purine response are distinct, though both depend on the presence of Bas1p.   This demonstrated that the close metabolic connections of one-carbon and purine metabolism are reflected in over-lapping, but separable regulatory mechanisms. The identity of the sensor of one-carbon unit depletion remains unknown, but in the course of investigation of the candidate regulator Caf17p, it was demonstrated that Caf17p is in fact involved in Fe/S cluster protein maturation.  Examination of the effects of Caf17p depletion revealed that Caf17p is required for the function and maturation of the related mitochondrial Fe/S proteins aconitase and homoaconitase, as well as the function of, but not de novo iron incorporation into, the mitochondrial radical-SAM Fe/S protein biotin synthase.  Because other Fe/S proteins were unaffected, Caf17p appears to be a specialised Fe/S maturation factor.  The presence of a putative H4folate binding site indicates that Caf17p may constitute a metabolic link between one-carbon and iron metabolism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase</field><field name="subject">Iron sulphur proteins</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the cutting performance in multipass abrasive waterjet machining of alumina ceramics with controlled nozzle oscillation</field><field name="creator">Zhong, Yu, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation has been undertaken to study the depth of cut in multipass abrasive waterjet (AWJ) cutting of an 87% alumina ceramic with controlled nozzle oscillation. The experimental data have been statistically analysed to study the trends of the depth of cut with respect to the process parameters. It has been found that multipass cutting with controlled nozzle oscillation can significantly increase the depth of cut. Within the same cutting time and using the same cutting parameters other than the jet traverse speed, it has been found that multipass cutting with nozzle oscillation can increase the depth of cut by an average of 74.6% as compared to single pass cutting without nozzle oscillation. Furthermore, a multipass cutting with higher nozzle traverse speeds can achieve a larger depth of cut than a single pass cutting at a low traverse speed within the same cutting time. A recommendation has been made for the selection of appropriate process parameters for multipass cutting with nozzle oscillation. In order to estimate the depth of cut on a mathematical basis, predictive models for the depth of cut in multipass cutting with and without nozzle oscillation have been developed using a dimensional analysis technique. The model development starts with the models for single pass cutting which are then extended to multipass cutting where considerations are given to the change of the actual standoff distance after each pass and the variation of kerf width. These predictive models has been numerically studied for their plausibility by assessing their predicted trends with respect to the various process variables, and verified qualitatively and quantitatively based on the experimental data. The model assessment reveals that the developed models correlate very well with the experimental results and can give adequate predictions of this cutting performance measure in process planning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multipass operation</field><field name="subject">Abrasive waterjet cutting</field><field name="subject">Controlled nozzle oscillation</field><field name="subject">Depth of cut</field><field name="subject">Dimensional analysis</field><field name="subject">Predictive mathematical model</field><field name="subject">Abrasives</field><field name="subject">Water jet cutting</field><field name="subject">Ceramics</field><field name="subject">Nozzles</field><field name="subject">Oscillations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of idealised image features in determining post-exposure body image and social comparisons</field><field name="creator">Aldridge, Fiona Jane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examined the role that idealised image characteristics have in determining post-exposure body image and amount of self-reported social comparisons. This was tested by exposing female undergraduate students to media-portrayed idealised images that varied in their level of relevance, salience, or attainability. A negative impact of these images was indicated by greater post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation inaccuracy. In contrast, a positive impact was considered to have occurred when body dissatisfaction decreased and body size estimation was more accurate. If the images had a neutral impact on body image, one would expect little difference between groups or over time. A further aim was to determine whether a higher level of trait tendency to compare was related to more negative responding at post-exposure. In addition, thin ideal internalisation and restraint were examined as possible moderators. Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 indicated that idealised image relevance and salience had little differential impact on post-exposure body image. That is, exposure to thin idealised images, irrespective of the salience and relevance manipulations, resulted in similar post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation. In contrast to this, the attainability of the image seemed to influence post-exposure responding, at least in terms of body size estimation (Study 4). Higher trait tendency to compare was associated with a greater amount of self-reported comparison with the images, but had little impact on body image. Surprisingly, these results were not moderated by thin ideal internalisation or restraint. The role of individual differences was explored with additional analyses in Study 5, which revealed that, when the power is sufficient, thin ideal internalisation, restraint, and self-reported comparisons with the images predicted post-exposure body dissatisfaction, but not body size estimation. Overall, this program of research suggests that idealised image features do not play a vital differential role in determining post-exposure body image, unless it is the body itself that is being manipulated.

Secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is the second most common form of congenital heart disease (CHD). Most cases have no known cause. Chromosomal, syndromal and teratogenic causes account for a minority of cases. The hypothesis that mutations in the ASD genes NKX2-5 and GATA4 may cause apparently sporadic ASD was tested by sequencing them in unrelated probands with ASD. In this study, 1/102 individuals with ASD had an NKX2-5 mutation, and 1/129 had a deletion of the GATA4 gene.  The cardiac transcription factor TBX20 interacts with other ASD genes but had not previously been associated with human disease. Of 352 individuals with CHD, including 175 with ASD, 2 individuals, each with a family history of CHD, had pathogenic mutations in TBX20. Phenotypes included ASD, VSD, valvular abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy.  These studies of NKX2-5, GATA4 and TBX20 indicate that dominant ASD genes account for a small minority of cases of ASD, and emphasize the considerable genetic heterogeneity in dominant ASD (also caused by mutations in MYH6 and ACTC). A new syndrome of dominant ASD and the Marcus Gunn jaw winking phenomenon is reported. Linkage to known loci was excluded, extending this heterogeneity, but a whole genome scan did not identify a candidate locus for this disorder.  Previous studies of inbred laboratory mice showed an association between patent foramen ovale (PFO) and measures of atrial septal morphology, particularly septum primum length (???flap valve length??? or FVL). In humans, PFO is associated with cryptogenic stroke and migraine, and is regarded as being in a pathological contiuum with ASD. Twelve inbred strains, including 129T2/SvEms and QSi5, were studied, with generation of [129T2/SvEms x QSi5] F1, F2 and F14 mice. Studies of atrial morphology in 3017 mice confirmed the relationship between FVL and PFO but revealed considerable complexity. An F2 mapping study identified 7 significant and 6 suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTL), affecting FVL and two other traits, foramen ovale width (FOW) and crescent width (CRW). Binary analysis of PFO supported four of these.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mapping.</field><field name="subject">Heart.</field><field name="subject">Genetics.</field><field name="subject">QTL.</field><field name="subject">Atrial septal defects.</field><field name="subject">Congenital heart disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in stem cell biology and developmental pathway regulation in the pancreas and breast</field><field name="creator">O'Toole, Sandra Alison, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Breast and pancreatic cancers are among the major causes of cancer mortality in our society. There has been a significant decline in mortality from breast cancer over the last two decades, while pancreatic cancer has an exceptionally poor prognosis. Although these malignancies have very different clinical outcomes they share the common feature that metastatic disease is almost uniformly fatal. The existence of cancer stem cells has been postulated as a major factor in tumour recurrence after traditional chemo- or radio-therapy. Addressing this important clinical question requires a deeper understanding of the biology of normal and cancer stem cells and the signalling pathways involved in their regulation. The identity of the pancreatic stem cell remains elusive. However, using a murine model of haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation I have demonstrated for the first time transdifferentiation of these bone marrow derived cells into mature pancreatic acinar cells, where they appear to contribute to cell turnover ultimately forming acini and lobules. These data show that HSC have surprising developmental plasticity and provide insight into a potential stem cell niche in the pancreas. The Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch signalling pathways play a critical role in early development and in the maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells. There is also increasing evidence that dysregulation of these pathways contributes to the development of many malignancies. There is relatively little information regarding their role in breast cancer development and progression. I used immunohistochemistry for key proteins in these pathways, sonic hedgehog, beta-catenin and Notch 1 in three substantial series of human breast lesions and determined that abnormal expression of these proteins is an early event in the development in breast cancer, and is associated with particular breast cancer subtypes, Shh and beta-catenin expression is associated predominantly with the basal-like phenotype and Notch 1 with the HER2 amplified phenotype. Overexpression of Shh in particular confers a worse clinical outcome in invasive ductal carcinoma. Furthermore, increased levels of Shh in a 3D culture model of non-transformed mammary epithelial cells resulted in disorganisation of acini and the development of an abnormal discohesive phenotype. Finally the role of Shh was investigated in a mammary epithelial transplantation model, where overexpression of Shh resulted in the development of hyperplasia of the mammary ductal epithelium.  Together these data confirm that the Hedgehog, Wnt and Notch developmental pathways are dysregulated in breast cancer and represent viable targets for further investigation of potential novel therapies in breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wnt</field><field name="subject">Hedgehog</field><field name="subject">Notch</field><field name="subject">Breast</field><field name="subject">stem cell</field><field name="subject">pancreas</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of a novel class of peptide mimics derived from N-acylisatins</field><field name="creator">Cheah, Wai Ching, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to synthesize a new class of peptide mimics derived from N-acylisatins and to investigate various methodologies for their synthesis.  N-Acetylisatin 15 and its derivatives 39 and 40 were found to undergo facile nucleophilic ring-opening with amino acid esters yielding a range of 2-acetamidophenylglyoxylamide derivatives in moderate to good yields. This type of reaction was also found to work for di- and tripeptide methyl ester hydrochlorides leading to a range of N-glyoxylamide peptide mimics. The methodology of the reaction conditions was further extended to N,N&#8242;-oxalyl bisisatins 17 and 134, and 1,3,5-tris(2,3-dioxoindoline-1-carbonyl)benzene 168 substrates and their reaction with amino acid esters gave a new range of C,C&#8242;-linked-bis-glyoxylamide peptide mimics and C,C&#8242;,C&#8242;&#8242;-linked tris-glyoxylamide peptide mimics respectively. Meanwhile, reactions of N-acylisatins with 1,10-diaminodecane 155 and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine 167 gave the corresponding bis and tris-glyoxylamides.  In the event of introducing amino acids at the N-1 position of isatin 9, a range of NH protecting groups for the synthesis of N-protected amino acid acyl isatins 193 were examined. It was found that the phthalamido group, e.g. phthaloylglycine 197, was the best protecting group for the introduction of a glycine unit at the N-1 position of isatin 9. Additionally, a viable and interesting alternative approach utilizing N-succinyl acylisatin 158 as the starting material was also demonstrated. In continuation of our interest in the peptidomimetic approach, a new class of cyclic peptide mimics using Grubbs?? ring-closing metathesis approach was also successfully synthesized. A range of bis-O-allyl substrates 237, 240, 242 and 246 were prepared from reaction of the corresponding N-acylisatins with L-valine allyl ester hydrochloride 236 and 1,10- diaminodecane 155 respectively. High conversion yields of the target macrocyclic systems 238, 241 and 243 were observed when the bis-Oallyl substrates were irradiated with Hoveyda-Grubb catalyst in a microwave reactor.

The CCFL that I have proposed is formed by writing three wavelength matched fibre Bragg gratings directly into a continuous length of doped fibre. I have also examined the relative advantages and disadvantages of interferometric and intensity-based hydrophone systems, and have established a hydrophone system that can be switched between the two modes of operation, by making use of digital signal processing. I have established a theoretical model to study the lasing and spectral characteristics of the CCFL. My analysis showed that whilst the CCFL have significantly different phase and threshold conditions from the common semiconductor diode lasers with external cavity, the CCFL also have mode-limiting properties that are often sought after. Through simulations, I was able to identify that a non-uniform straining scheme, that is, when one of the sub-cavities of the CCFL is restrained from strain, can improve the sensitivity with respect to existing single cavity fibre lasers, in both the frequency and intensity domains. My simulations also showed that the sensitivity of such a straining scheme can be optimised by tuning the reflectivity of the gratings, sub-cavity lengths, doping concentration and pump power. I have fabricated multiple CCFLs using the in-house grating writing facilities, and have experimentally assessed their power and spectral related lasing characteristics. Whilst having a significantly longer total cavity length compared to typical fibre lasers, the CCFLs demonstrated stable single longitudinal mode operation and narrow linewidth in the order for a few tens of kHz. Asymmetric output power and frequency as a result of unequal sub-cavity lengths were also examined. Finally, I conducted sensing experiments by applying the CCFLs in strain monitoring and intensity-based hydrophone. My results showed that the non-uniform straining scheme had significantly improved the intensity response of the CCFL, and that the acoustic pressure and frequency can be determined by directly sampling and applying Fourier transform to the output intensity of the fibre laser.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fibre Hydrophone</field><field name="subject">Fibre Laser</field><field name="subject">Fibre Optic Sensing</field><field name="subject">Laser communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Internal difference/where the meanings, are": a theory of productive mourning</field><field name="creator">Curran, Rebecca Alison, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a response to the abstract phenomenon of bereavement as well as to the death of an actual beloved. It situates mourning as ethically and politically significant, reading it as an instance of crisis for the bereaved subject as well as for the culture in which she is located. Via theorists as diverse as Julia Kristeva, Luce Irigaray, Jacques Derrida, Dominick LaCapra and Donald Winnicott, the thesis considers the enabling potential that is implicated in this crisis. It suggests that mourning has the capacity to manifest productively as a form of localised intervention or "revolt" that simultaneously invigorates the inner life of the subject and subverts certain ideological aspects of contemporary, Western culture. In particular, the thesis suggests that the significance of productive mourning lies in its capacity to attenuate, via an anti-elegiac approach to narrative, the normative discourse of "identity", a crucial element of the discursive network that sustains a socio-political system mired in the "truth" of liberal individualism. Productive mourning facilitates an interrogation of the self-other/subject-object dialectic embedded in Western culture. This interrogation might be conceived as a deconstruction of the subject in its privileged status relative to alterity, the deconstruction of, in other words, "identity" and its processes. The thesis is informed by the author's experience of bereavement and mourning following suicide. Utilising a fictocritical approach, it performs a commentary in addition to an argument, evincing a unique approach to delineating the personal, cultural and ethical significance of loss.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">suicide</field><field name="subject">mourning</field><field name="subject">bereavement</field><field name="subject">fictocriticism</field><field name="subject">friendship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/34956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lost in the archive: vision, artefact and loss in the evolution of hypertext</field><field name="creator">Barnet, Belinda, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">How does one write the history of a technical machine? Can we say that technical machines have their own genealogies, their own evolutionary dynamic? The technical artefact constitutes a series of objects, a lineage or a line. At a cursory level, we can see this in the fact that technical machines come in generations - they adapt and adopt characteristics over time, one suppressing the other as it becomes obsolete. It is argued that technics has its own evolutionary dynamic, and that this dynamic stems neither from biology nor from human societies. Yet 'it is impossible to deny the role of human thought in the creation of technical artefacts' (Guattari 1995, p. 37). Stones do not automatically rise up into a wall - humans 'invent' technical objects. This, then, raises the question of technical memory. Is it humans that remember previous generations of machines and transfer their characteristics to new machines? If so, how and where do they remember them? It is suggested that humans learn techniques from technical artefacts, and transfer these between machines. This theory of technical evolution is then used to understand the genealogy of hypertext. The historical differentiations of hypertext in different technical systems is traced. Hypertext is defined as both a technical artefact and also a set of techniques: both are a part of this third milieu, technics. The difference between technical artefact and technical vision is highlighted, and it is suggested that technique and vision change when they are externalised as material artefact. The primary technique traced is association, the organisational principle behind the hypertext systems explored in the manuscript. In conclusion, invention is shown to be an act of exhumation, the transfer and retroactiviation of techniques from the past. This thesis presents an argument for a new model of technical evolution, a model which claims that technics constitutes its own dynamic, and that this dynamic exceeds human evolution. It traces the genealogy of hypertext as a set of techniques and as series of material artefacts. To create this geneaology I draw on interviews conducted with Douglas Engelbart, Ted Nelson and Andries van Dam, as well as a wide variety of primary and secondary resources.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the RNAi pathway in influenza a virus infected mammalian cells</field><field name="creator">Yu, Yi-Hsin, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The interferon (lFN) signalling and RNA interference (RNAi) pathways are the major antiviral pathways in animals and plants, respectively. Although the mechanism of RNAi remains to be completely characterised, the genes that encode the proteins involved in this process have been identified in the plant, fungi and animal kingdoms (Fagard et al., 2000, Grishok et aI., 2000, Hall et al., 2003, Kanellopoulou et al., 2005, Kolb et al., 2005); with comparative analyses indicating that RNAi is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Several studies have identified RNAi suppressors encoded by animal viruses, suggesting an antiviral role for the RNAi pathway in animals as well as plants (Andersson et al., 2005, Bennasser et al., 2006, Garcia et al., 2006, Li et al., 2004, Lichner et al., 2003, Lingel et al., 2005, Lu &amp; Cullen, 2004, Wang et al., 2006). However, most of these studies were performed in non-mammalian systems and as yet, there is no direct evidence indicating that the RNAi pathway plays a significant antiviral role during the infection of mammalian cells. Interestingly, several viruses have now been shown to express their own microRNA (miRNA) in infected cells (Grey et al., 2005, Pfeffer et al., 2005, Pfeffer et al., 2004, Samols et al., 2005, Sullivan et al., 2005). Further, in the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV), there is evidence that the virus usurps the host cell miRNAs to enhance viral replication (Jopling et al., 2005). The principal aim of this project was to investigate the role of RNAi in mammalian cells during viral infection, particularly infection with the influenza A virus.  This thesis is divided into six major chapters followed by a brief general discussion. Chapter 1 contains a general introduction to the RNAi pathway. It describes the history of the discovery of RNAi and summarizes the known and proposed antiviral roles of the RNAi pathway in plants and mammalian cells. Chapter 2 describes the general materials and methods used for this project.  There are four main result chapters, each dealing with a specific experimental system. Each chapter is divided into a brief introduction, specific materials and methods used, followed by presentation of the experimental results and a brief discussion.  Chapter 3 describes the development of an in vitro Dicer activity assay to study the effect of viral proteins on the activity of the mammalian Dicer protein. It was demonstrated that crude cell lysates derived from influenza A virus infected cells impaired the activity of Dicer and this observation was not due to degradation of the Dicer protein by virally-induced proteases.  Chapter 4 describes the use of a GFP reporter assay for screening potential RNAi suppressors. This assay is suitable for studying viral proteins in isolation. The effect of the influenza NS1 protein on the RNAi pathway in HEK293 cells was investigated and it was shown that NS1 could exert modest, but nevertheless significant, suppression of the RNAi pathway. Northern studies, performed to examine the processing of shRNA in the presence of NS1, demonstrated that NSI suppressed the RNAi mechanism through interfering with the maturation ofshRNA into siRNA.  Chapter 5 describes the effect of over-expressing components of the RNAi pathway on influenza A virus infection. In these experiments, Exportin 5, which encodes a protein involved in the transport of pre-miRNA/shRNA into the cytoplasm, was over-expressed during influenza A virus infection. Reduced viral infection was observed in cells over-expressing Exportin 5, suggesting that this treatment protects cells from virus infection.  Chapter 6 describes the expressed small RNA profile during influenza A virus infection in MDCK cells. Novel canine miRNA homologues were identified through cloning and sequencing. No definitive evidence for virally-derived siRNA/miRNA was found but a general reduction of endogenous miRNA expression was detected.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RNAi pathway.</field><field name="subject">RNA.</field><field name="subject">NS1.</field><field name="subject">Virus.</field><field name="subject">Mammalian cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resistance and cultural revitalisation: reading Blackfoot agency in the texts of cultural transformation 1870&#150;1920</field><field name="creator">Tov??as de Plaisted, Blanca, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The radical transformations attendant upon the imposition of colonial rule on the Siksikaitsitapi or Blackfoot of northern Alberta and southern Montana are examined in this dissertation in order to emphasise the threads of continuity within a tapestry of cultural change c.1870-1920. The dissertation traces cultural persistence through the analysis of texts of history and literature that constructed Blackfoot subjectivity in the half-century following the end of traditional lifeways and settlement on three reserves in Canada and one reservation in the United States of America.  This interdisciplinary thesis has been undertaken jointly in the School of History and Philosophy, and the School of English, Media and Performance Studies. It combines the tools of historical research and literary criticism to analyse the discourses and counter-discourses that served to construct Blackfoot subjectivity in colonial texts. It engages with the ways in which the Blackfoot navigated colonisation and resisted forced acculturation while adopting strategies of accommodation to ensure social reproduction and even physical survival in this period. To this end, it presents four case studies, each focusing on a discrete process of Blackfoot cultural transformation: a) the resistance to acculturation and cultural revitalisation as it relates to the practice of Ookaan (Sun Dance); b) the power shifts ushered in by European contact and the intersection between power and Blackfoot dress practices; c) the participation of Blackfoot "organic intellectuals" in the construction of Blackfoot history through the transformation of oral stories into text via the ethnographic encounter; and d) the continuing links between Blackfoot history and literature, and contemporary fictional representations of Blackfoot subjectivity by First Nations authors. This thesis acknowledges that Blackfoot history and literature have been constructed through a complex matrix of textual representations from their earliest contacts with Europeans. This dissertation is a study of the intersection between textual representations of the Blackfoot, and resistance, persistence and cultural revitalisation 1870-1920. It seeks to contribute to debates on the capacity of the colonised Other to exercise agency. It engages with views articulated by organic intellectuals, and Blackfoot and other First Nations scholars, in order to foster a dialogue between Blackfoot and non-Blackfoot scholarship.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Siksika Indians.</field><field name="subject">Indians of North America -- Foreign influences.</field><field name="subject">Indians of North America -- Cultural assimilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bromine complexing agents for use in vanadium bromide (V/Br) redox flow cell</field><field name="creator">Poon, Grace, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Vanadium bromide (V/Br) flow cell employs the Br3-/Br- couple in the positive and the V(II)/V(III) couple in the negative half cell. One major issue of this flow cell is bromine gas formation in the positive half cell during charging which results from the low solubility of bromine in aqueous solutions. Bromine complexing agents previously used in the zinc-bromine fuel cell were evaluated for their applicability in V/Br flow cell electrolytes. Three quaternary ammonium bromides: N-ethyl-N-methyl-morpholinium bromide (MEM), N-ethyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium bromide (MEP) and Tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBA) were studied. It is known that aqueous bromine reacts with quaternary ammonium bromides to form an immiscible organic phase. Depending on the number of quaternary ammonium bromides used and the environmental temperature, the second phase formed will either be solid or liquid. As any solid formation would interrupt the flow cell operation, potential formation of such kind has to be eliminated. Stability tests of simulated V/Br electrolyte with added quaternary ammonium bromides were carried out at 11, 25 and 40 oC. In the absence of bromine, the addition of MEM, MEP and TBA were found to be stable in V/Br electrolytes. However, in the presence of bromine, solid formation was observed in the bromine rich organic phase when the V/Br electrolyte contained a single quaternary ammonium bromide (QBr) compound. For V/Br electrolytes with binary or ternary QBr mixtures containing TBA, the presence of bromine caused a viscous polybromide phase to form at room temperature and the release of bromine gas at higher temperature. Only a binary mixture of MEM and MEP formed a stable liquid organic phase between 11 ?? 40 oC. In this study it was found that V/Br electrolytes containing a binary QBr mixture (0.75M) of MEM and MEP gave the best combination that formed an orange oily layer in the presence of bromine without solidification between 11 ?? 40oC. Furthermore, it was found that samples of V/Br electrolytes containing a ternary QBr mixture, are less effective in bromine capturing if the total QBr concentration was less than 1 M at 40oC, where bromine gas evolution was observed. From electrochemical studies of V3+/V2+, it was found that the addition of MEM and MEP had a minimal effect on the formal potential of the V3+/V2+ couple, the V2+/V3+ transfer coefficient and the diffusion coefficient of V3+. Therefore, MEM and MEP can be added to the negative half-cell of a V/Br flow cell without major interference From linear sweep voltammetry, the kinetics of the Br-/Br3- redox couple was found to be mass transfer controlled. After the addition of MEM and MEP mixture, the exchange current density was found to decrease from 0.013 Acm-2 to 0.01 Acm-2. On the other hand the transfer coefficient before and after MEM and MEP addition was found to be 0.5 and 0.44 respectively. Since the kinetic parameters were not significantly affected by the addition of MEM and MEP mixture, they can be added to the positive half-cell of the V/Br flow cell as bromine complexing agents. The electrochemical studies of both V3+/V2+ and Br-/Br3- showed the addition of MEM and MEP has minimal interference with the redox reactions of the vanadium bromide flow cell. This thesis also investigated the effect of MEM and MEP addition on the cell performance of a lab scale V/Br flow cell using two different membranes (ChiNaf and VF11). Flow cell performance for 2 M V3.7+ + 0.19 M MEM + 0.56 M MEP electrolytes utilising ChiNaf membrane at 10 mAcm-2 produced an energy efficiency of 59%, and this decreased to 43% after 15 cycles. For the static cell utilising VF11 membrane, the addition of MEM and MEP reduced the energy efficiency from 59.7% to 43.4%. It is believed that this is caused by the mass transfer controlled Br-/Br3- couple in the complexed positive half-cell solution. Therefore, uniformity between the organic and aqueous phase is important for flow cells utilising electrolytes with MEM and MEP. Finally, the polarization resistance of a lab scale V/Br flow cell utilising ChiNaf membrane and 2 M V3.7+ electrolytes was found to be slightly higher during cell charging (3.9 &#61527;&#61472;cm2) than during the discharge process (3.6 &#61527;&#61472;cm2), which is opposed to that in the all-vanadium redox cell.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quaternary ammonium bromide (QBr)</field><field name="subject">Vanadium Bromide Redox Flow Cell</field><field name="subject">Redox Flow Cell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the distributional impacts of government</field><field name="creator">Siminski, Peter, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of three independent essays, unified by the common theme of the distributional impacts of government.  The first paper estimates the price elasticity of demand for pharmaceuticals amongst high-income older people in Australia. It exploits a natural experiment by which some people gained entitlement to a price reduction through the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (CSHC). The preferred model is a nonlinear Instrumental Variable (IV) difference-in-difference regression, estimated on repeated cross sectional survey data using the Generalised Method of Moments. No significant evidence is found for endogenous card take-up, and so cross-sectional estimates are also considered. Taking all of the results and possible sources of bias into account, the ??headline?? estimate is -0.1, implying that quantity demanded is not highly responsive to price.  The elasticity estimate is a key input into the second paper which analyses the distributional impact of the CSHC. I consider the trade-off between moral hazard and risk pooling. There have been few previous attempts internationally to address this trade-off empirically for any health insurance scheme. The utility gain through risk-pooling is found to be negligible. However, the deadweight loss through moral hazard may be considerable. I also use an illustrative model to demonstrate the possible effects of the CSHC on inter-temporal savings behaviour. While the CSHC may induce some people to save, it may have the opposite effect on others. The net impact was not determined.  The third paper estimates the Australian public sector wage premium. It includes a detailed critical review of the methods available to address this issue. The chosen approach is a quasi-differenced panel data model, estimated by nonlinear IV, which has many advantages over other methods and has not been used before for this topic. I find a positive average public sector wage premium for both sexes. The best estimates are 10.0% for men and 7.1% for women. The estimate for men is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.04) and borders on significance for women (p &lt; 0.07).

Referred to two families, Diprotodontidae and Palorchestidae, diprotodontoids are geographically and temporally widespread vombatimorphian taxa in Australian and New Guinean Cenozoic deposits. The most diverse diprotodontoid fauna recorded from any single region in Australia comes from Oligo-Miocene limestone deposits of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland. In this thesis a new diprotodontoid genus and five new species are described from Riversleigh, as well as additional material from Riversleigh for the palorchestids Propalorchestes novaculacephalus and Pr. ponticulus and diprotodontids Nimbadon lavarackorum, Neohelos tirarensis, Neohelos stirtoni and Ngapakaldia bonythoni. A new vombatomorphian family, Maradidae, known from a single species at Riversleigh, is recognised as the sister-group of a vombatid-diprotodontoid clade.  New abundant, exceptionally well-preserved cranial material of the zygomaturine Nimbadon lavarackorum enables characterisation of intraspecific variation and ontogenetic development. The results of these analyses have been used to discriminate species boundaries throughout this work.  Consequently: Nimbadon whitelawi is now considered a junior synonym of Ni. lavarackorum; Nimbadon scottorrorum is a junior synonym of Neohelos tirarensis; and Bematherium angulum is a synonym of Ngapakaldia bonythoni. The new Riversleigh diprotodontoids clarify phylogenetic relationships within and between diprotodontoid families.  The monophyly of both Palorchestidae and Diprotodontidae is strongly supported as is their union in the superfamily Diprotodontoidea. Monophyly of the Zygomaturinae and Diprotodontinae is not supported, primarily due to the unstable position of Alkwertatherium webbi as well as the high degree of homoplasy in cranial morphology of the more derived members of each subfamily.  Overall phylogenetic and distribution patterns for diprotodontoids is generally consistent with current interpretations of Riversleigh's stratigraphy.  Five diprotodontoid species allow direct biocorrelation with other Australian Tertiary mammal faunas. Riversleigh's basal System A deposits correlate with late Oligocene deposits of the Etadunna Formation of South Australia. Riversleigh's low-mid System C deposits correlate with the middle Miocene Bullock Creek Local Fauna of the Northern Territory. Riversleigh's high System C Jaw Junction and Encore Local Faunas contain diprotodontoid taxa antecedent to diprotodontoids of the late Miocene Alcoota Local Fauna of the Northern Territory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systematics.</field><field name="subject">Diprotodontoidea.</field><field name="subject">Ontogeny.</field><field name="subject">Maradidae.</field><field name="subject">Oligocene.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The de-colonisation of the Australian states</field><field name="creator">Twomey, Anne, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaboration and international trade</field><field name="creator">Luechaikajohnpan, Pinijsorn, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Over the last two decades there has been a tremendous increase in collaboration among competing firms. A significant number of these collaborations are international. This thesis explores the incentives and welfare consequences of collaboration in the context of international trade. We consider two types of cross-border collaborations. The first is collaboration by sharing a part of firms' value creating activities, such as technology development, product design and distribution. This saves on production costs but reduces product distinctiveness. Firms collaborate if and only if the reduction in product distinctiveness is lower than a threshold level. We find that the threshold increases with an increase in trade costs. That is, an increase in trade costs makes collaboration more likely. Higher trade cost lowers competition, which in turn enables the firms to save on fixed costs while forgoing some product distinctiveness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that contrary to standard intuition, higher trade cost could enhance consumers' welfare by inducing competitors to collaborate. We extend our model to endogenise location choice by the firms where collaboration requires co-location (due to the benefit of local spillovers or joint investment in key infrastructures). Unlike the original model, we find that an increase in trade costs can discourage collaboration. In both circumstances, we find that an increase in trade cost can improve consumer surplus. The second type of collaboration considered in this thesis is licensing. We extend the standard licensing literature to an environment where firms compete in the domestic as well as foreign market. We examine how trade cost affects the licensing decision as well as the optimal payment mechanism. We find that an increase in trade costs reduces the possibility of licensing. Concerning the payment mechanism, we find that (i) either royalty or (ii) a two-part tariff (involving a fixed fee as well as royalty payments) is optimal. An increase in trade costs reduces the likelihood of royalty only being the optimal payment mechanism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">licensing</field><field name="subject">competitor collaboration</field><field name="subject">trade cost</field><field name="subject">product distinctiveness</field><field name="subject">location choice</field><field name="subject">International trade</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances (Business) -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated methodology for assessing physical and technological life of products for reuse</field><field name="creator">Rugrungruang, Fatida, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Strategies for reuse of components are important in order to create a closed loop manufacturing system.  Over decades, the notion has been gaining ground due to environmental and legislative reasons. Reuse of components is desirable and in many cases might be economically beneficial. However, the implementation of reuse strategies has been hindered by the requirement of reliable methodologies to assess the remaining life and reuse potential of used components. The estimation of the remaining life is problematic as the useful life of a component is affected by several causes of obsolescence. The common causes are due to physical and technological issues. So far, little research has attempted to address these issues simultaneously, and integrating them. This thesis seeks to develop methodologies that aid in predicting the integrated remaining lifetime of used components. There are three core parts of this research. First, the methodology determines the remaining life of used components from the physical lifetime perspective. This was derived from the estimation of physical failure using failure rate data, and the statistical analysis of usage intensity age as obtained from customers survey. Second, the research presents the use of the technological forecasting technique to predict the remaining technological life. As it is influenced by the technology progress, the forecast was developed on the basis of product technology clusters and market trend extrapolation analysis. Finally, the resulting estimations from the two aspects were combined to obtain an integrated assessment for estimating the remaining life of components. The potential for components in a product to be reused is justified when the remaining life is greater than the average expected lifespan of the product. Two cases of domestic appliances &#150; televisions and washing machines were used to highlight and demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed method provides the practitioners with a promising tool for end-of-life decision making. This is in particularly attractive when used as a preliminary decision support tool prior to the time consuming and costly processes such as disassembly and quality testing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Component Reuse</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Manufacturing</field><field name="subject">Life Cycle Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based engineering tool for aiding in the conceptual design of composite yachts</field><field name="creator">Payne, Rozetta Mary, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Proposed in this thesis is a methodology to enable yacht designers to develop innovative structural concepts, even when the loads experienced by the yacht are highly uncertain, and has been implemented in sufficient detail to confirm the feasibility of this new approach. The new approach is required because today??s yachts are generally lighter, getting larger and going faster. The question arises as to how far the design envelope can be pushed with the highly uncertain loads experienced by the structure? What are the effects of this uncertainty and what trade-offs in the structural design will best meet the overall design objectives?  The new approach provides yacht designers with a means of developing innovative structural solutions that accommodate high levels of uncertainty, but still focus on best meeting design objectives constrained by trade-offs in weight, safety and cost. The designer??s preferences have a large, and not always intuitive, influence on the necessary design trade-offs. This in turn invites research into ways to formally integrate decision algorithms into knowledge-based design systems.  A lean and robust design system has been achieved by developing a set of tools which are blanketed by a fuzzy decision algorithm. The underlying tool set includes costing, material optimisation and safety analysis. Central to this is the innovative way in which the system allows non-discrete variables to be utilized along with new subjective measures of structural reliability based on load path algorithms and topological (shape) optimisation.  The originality in this work is the development of a knowledge-based framework and methodology that uses a fuzzy decision making tool to navigate through a design space and address trade-offs between high level objectives when faced with limited design detail and uncertainty. In so doing, this work introduces the use of topological optimisation and load path theory to the structural design of yachts as a means of overcoming the historical focus of knowledge-based systems and to ensure that innovative solutions can still evolve. A sensitivity analysis is also presented which can quantify a design??s robustness in a system that focuses on a global approach to the measurement of objectives such as cost, weight and safety. Results from the application of this system show new and innovative structural solutions evolving that take into account the designers preferences regarding cost, weight and safety while accommodating uncertain parameters such as the loading experienced by the hull.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fuzzy Multi-Attribute Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Yacht Design</field><field name="subject">Knowledge-Based Engineering</field><field name="subject">Composite Structures</field><field name="subject">Load Path Theory</field><field name="subject">Topological Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Process Based Costing</field><field name="subject">Genetic Plystack Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aberations of self : manifestations in cinema histories</field><field name="creator">Douglas, John Anthony, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Screen Test (Americana/Australiana) project is a collection of works that re-makes selected fragments of film spanning cinema history. Through a process of selectively slowing and stilling this form, of what Laura Mulvey  calls Delayed Cinema, opens up new possibilities for interpreting and understanding cinema and the photographic. The aesthetic qualities and repetition of the scene or shot are re-created and re-performed, allowing an alternate form of cinema to take place. This alternate cinema takes on the characteristic of the Hollywood screen test and thus we can see each piece as the artist performing the screen test for each film. However, over time the screen test becomes the site for shifting the aesthetic elements within the film and shaping the narrative as a form of aesthetic building block. The viewing of each fragment allows for a new reading of film that suspends or subverts the temporal narrative and allows the contained segment to exist outside of the film opening up the possibility of constructing and emphasizing new iconic images and meanings. Each video piece is supplemented with a photographic still in tableaux form that further explores the aesthetic material of the film or shot raising the aesthetic components of the film ( props, locations etc) to the level of fetishism that may have been missed in the original version. This photographic rendering of the film fragment rethinks the possibilities of photographic tableaux and its relation to the iconic and indexical of photomedia art practice. Similarly, each photographic work is informed by theories of film analysis and psychology that has examined the primacy of the film still with Freudian notions of the primal scene and the uncanny.  We are after all bringing to life the graveyard of cinema history. These photographic qualities of the mis en scene and the indexical of metonymy allow a heightened aesthetic experience, which transforms itself into an aberration of the director&#146;s intended meaning, thereby reconstructing this meaning within the context of camp humour and irony. The work also acts as a playful and absurd interpretation of the cult of celebrity within cinema and the art world, which frees up of the interpretation of the film&#146;s meaning and becomes the site for contemporary re-readings of film culture.  The juxtaposition of the American Hollywood film and its emphasis on studio lighting, props, character and dialogue against the outdoor location of the Australian films conflates the two cultural imperatives, allowing for the examination of cultural myth through cinema. American cinema is revealed as the dominant culture whose imperialism dogs Australian film  and fosters a culture of low self-esteem. Further, the Americana works become the site for cultural examinations of gender, narcissism and war - both real and imagined &#150; and Hollywood is explored in terms of its social imaginings and how they play into real life events. The Australiana component explores the mythology of the Australian landscape with an emphasis on the culture of masculinity and self-destructive violence. However, each work is the result of a conflation of both cultures and other films, or parts of the same film, shifted within the fragment. The production of each photographic and video piece requires the taking on of the role of director, cinematographer, actor and producer. Through the use of interactive technologies such as DVD and the Internet not only am I able to experience a new subjective relationship with the intricacies of cinema but also by recreating these cinematic fragments I am able to bring into being and transform the spectre of cinema into the realm of contemporary art practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary art</field><field name="subject">Cinema</field><field name="subject">Photomedia</field><field name="subject">Film psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">Video art</field><field name="subject">Motion pictures -- Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Motion picture plays -- History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Channel shortening equalizers for UWB receiver design simplification</field><field name="creator">Syed, Imtiaz Husain, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ultra Wideband (UWB) communication systems occupy large bandwidths with very low power spectral densities. This feature makes UWB channels highly rich in multipaths. To exploit the temporal diversity, a UWB receiver usually incorporates Rake reception. Each multipath in the channel carries just a fraction of the signal energy. This phenomenon dictates a Rake receiver with a large number of fingers to achieve good energy capture and output signal to noise ratio (SNR). Eventually, the Rake structure becomes very complex from analysis and design perspectives and incurs higher manufacturing cost. The first contribution of this thesis is to propose channel shortening or time domain equalization as a technique to reduce the complexity of the UWB Rake receiver. It is analyzed that most of the existing channel shortening equalizer (CSE) designs are either system specific or optimize a parameter not critical or even available in UWB systems. The CSE designs which are more generic and use commonly critical cost functions may perform poorly due to particular UWB channel profiles and related statistical properties. Consequently, the main contribution of the thesis is to propose several CSE designs to address the specific needs of UWB systems. These CSE designs not only exploit some general but also some UWB specific features to perform the task more efficiently. The comparative analysis of the proposed CSEs, some existing designs and the conventional Rake structures leads towards the conclusion. It is finally shown that the use of CSE at the receiver front end greatly simplifies the Rake structure and the associated signal processing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rake receivers</field><field name="subject">UWB</field><field name="subject">Channel shortening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A participatory, action-oriented and youth-led investigation into child domestic work in Iringa, Tanzania</field><field name="creator">Klocker, Natascha, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has two distinct yet interrelated parts. In the first instance, it investigates child domestic work in Iringa ? a small town in the Southern Highlands of Tanzania. Second, it examines the participatory action research methodology that was adopted as part of that investigation. Data were collected by a team of researchers that included children and young people who had themselves been domestic workers. A questionnaire, interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with local leaders, employers of child domestic workers and (both current and former) child domestic workers themselves. An agenda for change - that aimed towards the redistribution of power within domestic working arrangements - was developed on the basis of those data and presented to local government authorities in Iringa. This research makes a number of contributions to understandings of both child domestic work and participatory action research methodologies. First, the thesis contends that child domestic work is a complex activity which (despite its frequently exploitative and abusive character) should not be identified as a purely harmful force in the lives of young employees. The multiplicity of ways in which that occupation is experienced can only be uncovered through the incorporation of a range of stakeholders? perspectives. Second, this research found that notions of ?family? were discursively linked to child domestic working arrangements in Iringa. This has inhibited recognition of child domestic work as ?real work?, and contributed to the exploitation of these young employees. This thesis contends that increased formalisation and regulation of child domestic work would offer an opportunity to reconstruct child domestic workers as ?employees? and thereby improve their circumstances. This research has also challenged prevalent notions of children?s incompetence and shown that young people with minimal formal education can (and should) participate as co-researchers in academic endeavours investigating their lives. However, it has also found that young people?s competencies and interests vary, and that notions of appropriate participatory processes have often failed to take such diversity into account. This thesis contends that more participatory forms of evaluation may allow greater flexibility (and relevance) to be fostered when assessing the ?success? of participatory processes. Academics need to be alert to the alienating effects that (unwittingly) ?judgemental? and (unrealistically) ?perfect? accounts of participatory and action-oriented research processes can have on young scholars.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">domestic work</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="subject">Domestics</field><field name="subject">Participant observation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overt and covert partcipation of learners in Japanese language classrooms</field><field name="creator">Yoshida, Reiko, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates corrective-feedback episodes and learners?? private speech in Japanese language classrooms at a university to examine both overt and covert speech of the adult learners in relation to their target language learning. Corrective-feedback episodes between teachers and learners in language classrooms have been focused on as typical interactions in the classrooms and a factor that contributes to learning of target languages. Ohta (2001) found that learners noticed their teachers?? corrective feedback to the other learners and responded to the feedback in their private speech, and that they also repeated others or manipulated sounds or forms by using their private speech. As learners notice a gap between what they actually can produce and what they want to say, when they produce target languages, even without feedback (Swain, 1985; Swain and Lapkin, 1995), learners?? private speech should be examined as well as their corrective-feedback episodes in classrooms. The data were collected from six learners and two teachers at a Level 2 (upper beginning) Japanese course for two semesters (throughout a year). The data are composed of classroom observations, audio and video-recordings of the classrooms, and stimulated recall interviews with both the teachers and the learners following the classroom recordings. All corrective-feedback episodes and the learners?? private speech were transcribed and coded according to error type, corrective-feedback type, types of response to the feedback, and types of the learners?? private speech. The teachers tended to use recasts often because of the time limitation of the classroom teaching and their teaching policy. However, all the learners preferred to be given opportunities to self-correct their own errors before being provided with correct answers by recasts. Private speech had functions of cognitive/metacognitive, affective/social, and self-regulation, which overlapped with each other. The learners were aware of their use of private speech in the classrooms. The teachers sometimes noticed their learners?? use of private speech in the classes. The learners used both Japanese and English as cognitive tools as well as communicative tools. The learners used every opportunity for their learning, by overtly and covertly participating, in the class.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Private speech</field><field name="subject">Classroom speech</field><field name="subject">Corrective feedback</field><field name="subject">Japanese language -- Study and teaching -- English speakers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multi-channel real-time GPS position location system</field><field name="creator">Parkinson, Kevin James, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since its introduction in the early 1980??s, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become an important worldwide resource. Although the primary use of GPS is for position location, the inherent timing accuracy built into the system has allowed it become an important synchronisation resource for other systems. In most cases the GPS end user only requires a position estimate without awareness of the timing and synchronisation aspects of the system. A low accuracy position (at the several-metre level) with a low update rate of about 1Hz is often acceptable. However, obtaining more accurate position estimates (at the sub-metre level) at higher update rates requires the use of differential correction signals (DGPS) and greater processing power in the receiver.  Furthermore, some extra challenges arise when simultaneously gathering information from a group of independently moving remote GPS receivers (rovers) at increased sampling rates (10Hz). This creates the need for a high bandwidth telemetry system and techniques to synchronise the position measurements for tracking each rover. This thesis investigates and develops an overall solution to these problems using GPS for both position location and synchronisation. A system is designed to generate relative position information from 30 or more rovers in real-time. The important contributions of this research are as follows: a) A GPS synchronised telemetry system is developed to transport GPS data from each rover. Proof of concept experiments show why a conventional RF Local Area Network (LAN) is not suitable for this application. The new telemetry system is developed using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices to embed both the synchronising logic and the central processor. b) A new system architecture is developed to reduce the processing load of the GPS receiver. Furthermore, the need to transfer the DGPS correction data to the rover is eliminated. Instead, the receiver raw data is processed in a centralised Kalman filter to produce multiple position estimates in real-time. c) Steps are taken to optimise the telemetry data stream by using only the bare essential data from each rover. A custom protocol is developed to deliver the GPS receiver raw data to the central point with minimal latency. The central software is designed to extract and manage common elements such as satellite ephemeris data from the central reference receiver only. d) Methods are developed to make the overall system more robust by identifying and understanding the points of failure, providing fallback options to allow recovery with minimal impact. Based on the above a system is designed and integrated using a mixture of custom hardware, custom software and off-the-shelf hardware. Overall tests show that efforts to minimise latency, minimise power requirements and improve reliability have delivered good results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TDMA</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">GPS receivers</field><field name="subject">Synchronization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equivocal empire: British community development in Central Africa, 1945-55</field><field name="creator">Kark, Daniel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis resituates the Community Development programme as the key social intervention attempted by the British Colonial Office in Africa in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A preference for planning, growing confidence in metropolitan intervention, and the gradualist determination of Fabian socialist politicians and experts resulted in a programme that stressed modernity, progressive individualism, initiative, cooperative communities and a new type of responsible citizenship. Eventual self-rule would be well-served by this new contract between colonial administrations and African citizens.  The thesis focuses on the implementation of the Mass Education programme in Nyasaland, and, more specifically, on a small but significant Mass Education scheme at Domasi, that operated between 1949 and 1954 in Nyasaland??s south. The political and social context in which the Mass Education scheme was implemented in Nyasaland is important. The approach taken by the government of the Protectorate before the mid-1940s is discussed, and previous welfare interventions described and critically assessed. The initial approach to Mass Education in Nyasaland is also dwelt upon in some detail. The narrative concentrates upon the scheme itself. Three themes emerge and are discussed successively ?? the provision of social services adapted to the perceived needs of Africans, the enforcement of environmental restrictions and inappropriate social and agricultural models, and the attempted introduction of representative local government. All three interventions were intended to promote the precepts of Mass Education, but instead resulted in the extension of state administrative power. The manner in which this occurred is explored throughout the thesis.  Mass Education at Domasi did not result in the creation of a new form of citizenship in Nyasaland. It contributed instead to a breakdown in the narrative of social development and eventual self-rule that had legitimised British rule. The riots that occurred in 1953 tore at the precepts that underpinned the Mass Education programme. The immediacy of self-rule and independence resulted in a shift in emphasis within the Colonial Office and the colonial government in Nyasaland from social intervention and to constitutional reform and political development. There simultaneously emerged a new rural transcript, one that privileged open opposition to the colonial social prescription over subtle and hidden rural resistance. At a time when nationalist politics was in disarray in Nyasaland, rural Africans spoke back to colonial power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">British Africa</field><field name="subject">Mass Education</field><field name="subject">Community Development</field><field name="subject">colonial</field><field name="subject">malawi</field><field name="subject">Community development -- Africa</field><field name="subject">Great Britain -- Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional and metabolic responses of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to the addition of L-serine</field><field name="creator">Lee, Johnny Chien-Yi, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sudden changes in nutrient resources are common in the natural environment. Cells are able to adapt and propagate under changing environmental conditions by making adjustments in their cellular processes. These cellular adaptations involve genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming that results in the induction or repression of metabolic pathways. Specific enzymes are then synthesised and activated to maximise the use of the newly available nutrient sources.             L-serine is one of the twenty proteinogenic amino acids, and can be synthesised in yeast by the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways when growing on fermentable or non-fermentable carbon sources or taken up from the environment when available. L-serine is metabolically linked to glycine and is a predominant donor of one-carbon units in one-carbon metabolism. L-serine is also a source of pyruvate and ammonia and contributes to other cellular processes including the biosynthesis of cysteine and phospholipids.             Previous work has shown that yeast cells exhibit transcriptional induction of the one-carbon pathway and the genes involved in the synthesis of purine and methionine after the addition of 10 mM glycine. Here it is shown that addition of 10 mM L-serine did not, however,  elicit the same transcriptional response. This is primarily due to differences in the uptake of glycine and L-serine in yeast. High concentrations of extracellular L-serine were required for yeast to show an increase in intracellular L-serine concentration of the magnitude required to trigger a noticeable cellular response. Despite L-serine and glycine being interconvertable via the SHMT isozymes and being a one-carbon donor, the genome-wide transcriptional response exhibited by cells in response to L-serine addition was markedly different to that seen for glycine. The predominant response to an increase in intracellular L-serine was the induction of the general amino acid control system and the CHA1 gene encoding the serine (threonine) dehydratase. Unlike glycine, addition of L-serine triggered only minor induction of the one-carbon pathway. A large portion of intracellular L-serine was converted to pyruvate and ammonia in the mitochondrion as the result of induction of CHA1. The high intracellular concentration of L-serine stimulated the cell to increase the production of oxaloacetate and to increase the biosynthesis of L-aspartate. Transient increases in the intracellular L-glutamate and L-glutamine were also observed after the addition of L-serine.             The work presented in this study shows that large increase in the intracellular concentration of amino acid is required to trigger a significant transcriptional response. Yeast cells exhibit different transcriptional and metabolic responses to the addition of L-serine and glycine even though these two amino acids are closely metabolically linked. Addition of L-serine provokes the GAAC response, expression of the CHA1 gene and stimulates the biosynthesis of L-aspartate in yeast whereas addition of glycine induces the one-carbon pathway which leads to the biosynthesis of the purine nucleotides.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast.</field><field name="subject">L-serine.</field><field name="subject">Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</field><field name="subject">Amino acids -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Amino acids -- Biosynthesis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A simulation model for quantifying and reducing the bullwhip effect</field><field name="creator">Wangphanich, Pilada, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Over the past of decade, the bullwhip effect has increasingly become a popular topic for researchers and practitioners in the area of supply chain management since it negatively influences cost, inventory, reliability and other important business processes in supply chain agents. Although there are many remedies for the bullwhip effect summarised in existing literature, it still occurs in several industries. This is partly because it is difficult to apply the results from existing research which analyse the bullwhip effect mainly in a simple supply chain. In addition, several tools and methodologies developed are used for analysing the bullwhip effect in a simple supply chain with several constraints.  Therefore, this research aims to develop a unique simulation approach based on system dynamics modelling and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for quantifying and reducing the bullwhip effect in a multi-product, multi-stage supply chain. System dynamics modelling which is a powerful simulation approach for studying and managing complex feedback system was selected as a main tool in this research. In addition, ANFIS was implemented in system dynamics modelling in order to increase the reliability of a system dynamics model for modelling soft variables. The proposed model covers variables influencing the bullwhip effect which are the structure of supply chain network, supply chain contributions and supply chain performances. As a result, a two layer simulation with three generic models was developed. The flexibility of this proposed model is the ability to model various types of ordering policies which are basic inventory policies, Material requirement planning (MRP) system and Just in time (JIT) approach. Three actual manufacturing supply chains were used as case studies to validate and demonstrate the flexibility of the model developed in this research. This model satisfactorily quantifies the bullwhip effect and the bullwhip effect levels identified in these case studies are significantly decreased by using the proposed simulation model. The successful results indicate that the model can be a useful alternative tool for supply chain managers to quantify and reduce the bullwhip effect in multi-product, multi-stage supply chains.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANFIS</field><field name="subject">Bullwhip Effect</field><field name="subject">System dynamics</field><field name="subject">Business logistics</field><field name="subject">Supply and demand</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust state estimation and model validation techniques in computer vision</field><field name="creator">Al-Takrouri, Saleh Othman Saleh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to apply ideas and techniques from modern control theory, especially from robust state estimation and model validation, to various important problems in computer vision.  Robust model validation is used in texture recognition where new approaches for classifying texture samples and segmenting textured images are developed. Also, a new model validation approach to motion primitive recognition is demonstrated by considering the motion segmentation problem for a mobile wheeled robot.  A new approach to image inpainting based on robust state estimation is proposed where the implementation presented here concerns with recovering corrupted frames in video sequences. Another application addressed in this thesis based on robust state estimation is video-based tracking. A new tracking system is proposed to follow connected regions in video frames representing the objects in consideration. The system accommodates tracking multiple objects and is designed to be robust towards occlusions.  To demonstrate the performance of the proposed solutions, examples are provided where the developed methods are applied to various gray-scale images, colored images, gray-scale videos and colored videos.  In addition, a new algorithm is introduced for motion estimation via inverse polynomial interpolation. Motion estimation plays a primary role within the video-based tracking system proposed in this thesis. The proposed motion estimation algorithm is also applied to medical image sequences. Motion estimation results presented in this thesis include pairs of images from a echocardiography video and a robot-assisted surgery video.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer vision.</field><field name="subject">Robust state estimation.</field><field name="subject">Robust model validation.</field><field name="subject">Control theory .</field><field name="subject">Robust control .</field><field name="subject">Estimation theory .</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxidative, inflammatory and vascular factors in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Poljak, Anne, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In spite of impressive recent progress, the aetiopathogenesis of Alzheimer&#146;s disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. The distinctive neuropathological features of AD, in particular the plaques and tangles, have been the particular focus of most aetiological theories.  It is well accepted that AD is a multifactorial disease, with alterations to a variety of brain structures and cell types, including neurons, glia and the brain vasculature. Studies of risk factors have revealed a diversity of genetic variables that interact with health, diet and lifestyle-related factors in the causation of AD.  These factors influence the structure, aggregation and function of a set of proteins that are increasingly the focus of research.  The work in this thesis has focused on the pathophysiological aspects of some of these proteins in a number of cellular compartments and brain. Several assays have been established and techniques utilized in the completion of this work, including; differential detergent fractionation of brain tissue, 1D and 2D PAGE, western blotting with chemiluminescence detection, ELISA assays of Abeta 1-40 and 1-42, quantitative ECNI GCMS of o- and m-tyrosine as well as metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, quantitative MALDI-TOF assay of hemorphins and LCMSMS based proteomics, to identify proteins with altered expression levels in AD relative to control brain tissue. A variety of regional differences have been observed in the biochemistry of the AD cortex which are probably the outcome of local response variations to AD pathology. One of the most consistent threads throughout this work has been an apparent resilience of the occipital lobe relative to the other brain regions, as reflected in lower overall levels of oxidative stress and increased levels of proteins associated with metabolic processes, neuronal remodeling and stress reduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Dementia</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Vascular</field><field name="subject">Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Metabolomics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41273</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interplay between sexual selection, inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="creator">Zajitschek, Susanne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inbreeding can have profound negative effects on individuals by reducing fertility and viability. In populations, inbreeding depression can reduce growth rates and increases extinction risk. The aims of this thesis are to investigate inbreeding depression in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and to study the evolution of mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance in females, using guppies from a feral population in Queensland, Australia. Male guppies are highly polymorphic in their sexual ornamentation, indeed they show one of the most extreme polymorphisms observed in nature. Female guppies exhibit complex mate choice based on preferences for ornamentation, as well as social context.  I aim is to examine how these factors of inbreeding avoidance alter sexual selection.   In male guppies I found strong inbreeding depression in male sperm numbers, which is amplified under semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Chapter 2). Moreover, inbreeding depression results in low fertility under sperm competition: an experiment using artificial insemination techniques reveals that highly inbred males are heavily disadvantaged in gaining paternity (Chapter 3). On population level, inbreeding depression is manifest in reduced growth rates, predominantly in the early stages of inbreeding (Chapter 4). Population growth at inbreeding coefficients f=0.375-0.59 did not seem to lead to inbreeding depression, whereas lower levels of inbreeding reduced population growth. Although the growth rates in inbred populations appear normal, severe inbreeding depression is uncovered after outbred immigrants are added.  Specifically, male immigrants are most efficient in short-term genetic rescue, probably due to insemination of large numbers of females whereas females are limited in the number of eggs they can produce (Chapter 4).  Male ornamental traits show significant inbreeding depression in semi-natural conditions only (Chapters 2 &amp; 3). Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms seem to have evolved in females: they prefer courtship displays of non-inbred males (Chapter 2), unfamiliar males (Chapter 5) and males with rare patterns (Chapter 6). This preference might increase the mating success of immigrants, and may have evolved to facilitate the avoidance of inbreeding. Together with context-independent preferences for ornament combinations (Chapter 6), it also offers an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism in this species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guppy</field><field name="subject">sexual selection</field><field name="subject">inbreeding avoidance</field><field name="subject">Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">familiarity</field><field name="subject">female preference</field><field name="subject">inbreeding depression</field><field name="subject">sperm competition,</field><field name="subject">complex traits</field><field name="subject">selection analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimates and projections of HIV and Hepatitis C virus in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region</field><field name="creator">Razali, Karina, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of mathematical models in studying disease epidemics can be diverse, from the focused study of the role of a single determinant of the epidemic, or to the overall estimation of morbidity and mortality.  In using simple deterministic models, a balance is struck between biological and social complexities, and the high data input demands of mathematical models.  This thesis aims to apply the use of deterministic mathematical models to the studies of HIV and hepatitis C epidemiology in the Asia-Pacific region.  In Australia, about 85% of reported HIV cases are among homosexual men.  Casual homosexual partnerships made up 40% of incident HIV cases in 1995 increasing to 65% in 2004.  In the state of New South Wales, it was estimated that over 7,500 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005, increasing to over 10,000 by 2016 with existing levels of intervention.  Intervention measures were estimated to have prevented some 44,500 cases, the majority being among injecting drug users through the Needle and Syringe Programmes.  Models for the HIV epidemics in developing countries were also developed incorporating multiple routes of HIV transmission.  For Papua New Guinea, it was estimated 64,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005, rising to over 500,000 by 2025 with current levels of intervention.  High levels of interventions, in particular increased condom use, will be required to achieve a stabilisation or reduction in HIV prevalence.  In East Timor, the HIV epidemic is still in the early stages with 138 people estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS, rising to 5,000 by 2025 with minimal intervention.  For HCV, models of the epidemic in Australia showed HCV incidence peaking in 1999, followed by a decline reaching 9,700 incident cases in 2005.  Of 197,000 estimated chronic HCV cases in 2005, 58% had stage F 0/1 liver disease, 15% F 2/3 liver disease, and 2% HCV-related cirrhosis.  Models estimated 210 and 105 people developed HCV-related liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively.  Comparisons of modelled HCV long-term sequelae projections with linkage data showed relatively good agreement, despite discrepancies in liver-related deaths.  To decrease the number of chronic HCV, at least a tripling of treatment coverage would be required.  These models provide estimates of the current levels of epidemics as well as projections of future scenarios under different intervention strategies, which have an important role in the planning of strategies, as well as assessment of previous epidemic conditions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical modelling.</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C Virus.</field><field name="subject">HIV (Viruses) -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">HIV (Viruses) -- Asia.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Helping jurors to evaluate eyewitness identifications: the role of expert evidence and judicial instruction</field><field name="creator">Martire, Kristy Anne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychologists, legal practitioners and scholars share the knowledge that honest eyewitnesses can err in their attempts to identify the perpetrator of a crime. This thesis reports an experimental investigation of the extent to which expert evidence and judicial instruction can improve juror ability to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate identifications. Special attention is also paid to the logic of inferences which have been made by psychologists regarding the efficacy of expert evidence, and compares methodologies adopting direct measures of participant Sensitivity to Eyewitness Accuracy (SEA) with those that can only indirectly assess this construct. Study 1 surveys the knowledge and opinions of legal professionals regarding eyewitness identification issues (n = 35), showing that respondents expressed doubts that judicial instructions would exert an effect equivalent to that of eyewitness expert evidence. Accordingly, Experiments 1 to 4 (Experiment 1, n = 104; Experiment 2, n = 238; Experiment 3, n = 228; Experiment 4, n = 297) were conducted to directly assess the relative impacts of judicial instruction and expert evidence on participant juror SEA. The methodology utilised in these investigations incorporated the testimony of real eyewitnesses to a staged crime scenario in order to assess the impact of instruction on juror ability to discriminate between known accurate and known inaccurate eyewitnesses. Overall, little evidence was found to support the notion that expert evidence is more effective than judicial instruction, as no significant association was identified between instruction type and SEA. This result was found to hold irrespective of the objective quality of the expert?s testimony (accurate or erroneous). In light of the results from Experiments 1 to 4, Experiment 5 was designed to investigate why the experts were not able to improve the discrimination accuracy of the jurors. This study focused on the extent to which participants of varying levels of expertise could correctly classify eyewitness accuracy. The results of Experiment 5 (n = 145) suggest that experts were no better able to discriminate between accurate and inaccurate eyewitnesses than novice laypeople. Overall, the evidence reported in this thesis raises serious questions regarding the utility of eyewitness expertise in the completion of eyewitness discrimination tasks.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Judicical Instruction</field><field name="subject">Eyewitness</field><field name="subject">Expert Testimony</field><field name="subject">Jurors</field><field name="subject">Eyewitness identification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectral analysis of arterial blood prssure and stroke volume variability: the role of Calcium channel blockers and sensitizers</field><field name="creator">Alomari, Abdul-Hakeem Hussein, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we included results from two studies. The first one considered the effects of the blood volume changes, during blood donation, on the heart rate variability (HRV) measured, non-invasively, form electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals. Our results showed that, during blood donation, there were no significant changes in the pulsatile area of PPG signal, while heart rate increased. No significant changes were noticed in HRV extracted from both signals. Error analysis between the HRV extracted from ECG and peak interval variability (PIV) suggested that the error during blood donation was increased which means that the use of PIV extracted from PPG signal, used as a replacement diagnostic tool in clinical applications, needs further investigations and should be carefully studied in non-stationary cardiovascular situations such as blood donation.  The imbalance between the two branches of the autonomic nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic, vagal, may result in a harmful activation of myocardial tissues which cause arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Although the study of the sympathovagal balance have been attracting many researchers, further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of many kinds of drugs on the autonomic modulation of the cardiac muscle, specifically, the cells of sinoatrial (SA) node. The aim of the second part of this thesis was to assess the effects of calcium channel blocker (Verapamil), calcium channel sensitizer (Levosimendan), calcium chloride (CaCl2), the combinations of verapamil/ CaCl2, levosimendan/ CaCl2, and noradrenaline infusion on beat-to-beat cardiovascular variability represented, in this research, by systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV), and stroke volume variability (SVV) signals. We used Fat Fourier Transform (FFT) to evaluate the power spectral density of the fluctuations in both signals to evaluate the effects of short-term treatments with those drugs on the sympathovagal balance in normal rats. Then, we compared the spectra obtained from SBPV and SVV to decide which of these fluctuations along with corresponding spectrum was more able to provide a clear feedback about the autonomic nervous system. Our data suggests that there were a significant correlations between low- (LF), mid- (MF), and high-frequency (HF) spectra obtained from SBPV and SVV except between the HF spectra estimated from after the infusion of levosimendan where a poor correlation (r = 0.530, p = 0.281) was noticed. This that both HF components obtained provide different information regarding the autonomic nervous system modulation of the SA node cells, while the results obtained from the rest of experiments showed that both signals provide same information about the modulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone due to all stages of different drugs infusion studied in this thesis. Besides that, we found that both spectra may be used to track the fluctuations in the cardiac output as a result of the drugs infusion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Levosimendan.</field><field name="subject">Photoplethysmographic signal.</field><field name="subject">Stroke volume variability.</field><field name="subject">Calcium channel sensitizers.</field><field name="subject">Levosimendan.</field><field name="subject">Stroke volume variability.</field><field name="subject">Blood pressure variability.</field><field name="subject">Spectral analysis.</field><field name="subject">Sympathovagal balance.</field><field name="subject">Blood volume.</field><field name="subject">Calcium.</field><field name="subject">Verapamil.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remembering polishness: articulating and maintaining identity through turbulent times</field><field name="creator">Drozdzewski, Danielle, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis details the maintenance of Polish identities through acts of memory: the  (re)production, transmission and reception of Polish cultural practices.  The                 (re)productions and transmissions of Polish identity formations, and the acts of remembrance, are multifarious by nature, and I have examined them in two distinctly different settings ?? in public spheres in Poland, and in the private realms of Australian Polish diaspora.  In this thesis, these research settings have been conceptualised as the conduits through which Polish identities are maintained.  Polish identity is theorised using a constructivist approach; Polish identities are therefore positioned historically and geographically.  Their performances are fluid: they move through time and across spaces.  The active maintenance of Polish identity developed as a result of foreign occupations.  The partitioning of Poland by the Austro-Hungarian, Prussian and Russian Empires lasted 123 years.  From 1795 to 1918 the Polish nation was expunged.  Following a brief period of independence between World War I (WWI) and World War II (WWII), Poland was again occupied by Nazi and Soviet regimes during WWII (1939-1945).  The Soviet occupation continued after WWII with the Soviet-supported Polish government that lasted until 1989.  Under occupation ?? particularly during WWII ?? Poland suffered events that have been indelibly imprinted within Polish cultural memory.  The macabre nature of this era included the incursion of hegemonic regimes on political and everyday social life, as well as the atrocities for which it is well known.  An important outcome of these occupations has been the division of discourses of Polishness, and their remembrances, into distinctly public and private spheres.  These periods of foreign occupation brought various attempts to suppress and eliminate Polishness: the cultures and identifications of Polish people.  Suppression particularly occurred in public spheres through the prohibition of the Polish language, and by investing the public memory landscape with ideologies that represented the new regimes.  By repressing public commemorations of Polish cultural narratives, a new history was written at the expense of the Polish experience.  There have been two primary responses to these repressions of Polishness.  These responses initially developed during the partitioned period to ensure that Polish language and cultural practices were maintained.  First, a narrative and tradition of resistance emerged in reaction to the Russian, Prussian and Austrian partitions.  It was enacted through military participation in insurrections and through the production of patriotic Romantic Era cultural artefacts, both of which strengthened linkages to the Polish Catholic faith.  Second, Polish cultural practices and language were safeguarded in the private spheres of home.  It was in private settings, in Poland and within the diaspora in Australia, that memories and experiences of occupation were passed on and through generations.  In Poland, such narratives were often maintained in resistance to those imposed by foreign occupiers and because of the inability to commemorate events of Poland??s macabre past in public.  In Australia, identity maintenance has occurred to resist the dissolution of Polishness in a diasporic and multicultural environment.  This thesis demonstrates the utility of studying cultural memories as a means of understanding how identity maintenance can occur in the face of adversities, such as the multiple foreign occupations that occurred in Poland, and in diaspora.  Moreover, it exemplifies the diverse paths of identity maintenance in different contexts.  This thesis shows that despite the distinctive character of both Polish public and private spheres, Polish identities have been informed, shaped and maintained through culturally-enacted memory (re)production.  This process is exhibited in the present ?? in Poland and through the diaspora ?? and it occurred despite the repressive aims of various foreign occupiers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polishness</field><field name="subject">Cultural Memory</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora</field><field name="subject">Identity (Philosophical concept)</field><field name="subject">Polish -- Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory-based description of Australian franchising regulation</field><field name="creator">Moore, Gregory Allison, Business Law &amp; Taxation, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper examines franchising regulation in Australia as a case study for the analysis of regulation based on established regulatory theory. A literature review is conducted to establish and critique the theory of regulation based on the four main areas of established theory; regulatory purpose, regulatory strategies, rulemaking and enforcement. Case study data is drawn from primary source material and academic commentary on franchising regulation and presented according to the eras of franchising regulation in Australia, moving from the first proposals for legislation in the 1970s to the prescribed mandatory Franchising Code of Conduct model adopted in 1998 and refinements made to that scheme up to 2006. An analysis is then conducted on each major aspect of Australian franchising regulation using the established theoretical principles and analytical constructs available in the literature. The study concludes that the Franchising Code of Conduct regime, as a culmination of the experience gained and study undertaken in the preceding eras, is characterised by the availability of a broad range of enforcement options from harsh deterrence-oriented measures to more gentle and cooperative compliance-oriented options constituting an effective regulatory pyramid. The effectiveness of the regime is further bolstered by the presence of a credible regulatory strategy pyramid which emphasises the real possibility of escalated intervention, coupled with skilful deployment by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission as enforcement agency. The principal weakness of the scheme is identified as unnecessarily ambiguous drafting in some areas, which compromises the quality of the otherwise highly transparent ruleset. It is suggested that the choice of regulatory strategy, often a focus of superficial examinations of regulation, is largely irrelevant to the nature of the regulation, with other features such as enforcement strategy, legitimacy, and availability of credible sanctions proving much more important. A proposal for an analytical framework based on the established theory is developed based on the experience of applying that theory to the case study. While this outlined framework assists in broadening focus across the entire regulatory regime to encourage assessment of the component parts, a lack of cohesion and linkage amongst the components highlights a shortcoming in the development of regulatory theory and an opportunity for further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Code of Conduct</field><field name="subject">Regulation</field><field name="subject">Franchising</field><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade) -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Trade regulation -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of mechanisms that impact trust: a domain study of online auctions</field><field name="creator">Bewsell, Glenn Robert, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated trust over the Internet to seek a better understanding of trust and ways to increase trust in online transactions. The focus of this investigation was consumer-to-consumer transactions at online auctions where key actors were virtually anonymous to each other. The perceptions of a broad range of online auction community members support this thesis. Normative and grounded theoretical perspectives of trust and factors that affected trust were considered, compared and contrasted as part of this research. Concept mapping and the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) were used to underpin the grounded theoretical perspective of trust developed as part of this thesis. Online auction cases were selected and analysed to check the grounded theoretical perspective of trust developed. This thesis provided a better understanding of trust, provided new insights into trust and distrust, added to the body of theory for trust and identified ways to increase trust in online transactions. This thesis provided better understandings of: trust; moral obligations; network decision structures; power; fairness; and perceived behavioural controls at online auctions. A grounded theoretical model of trust based in TPB was developed that was specific to online auctions. This model of trust developed appeared to provide clearer and richer insights into online auction trust. The model of trust developed identified factors and constructs that affected trust rather than the magnitude of any affects. The model developed and findings of this thesis can be applied to new or specific online auction sites to help practitioners build better online environments to encourage more people to transact rather than just browse online. The grounded theoretical perspective of trust and findings of this thesis may be relevant to other online consumer-to-consumer transactional environments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online trust</field><field name="subject">Auctions</field><field name="subject">Online auctions</field><field name="subject">eTrust</field><field name="subject">eBusiness</field><field name="subject">eCommerce</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">System modelling of the compact linear Fresnel reflector</field><field name="creator">Pye, John Downing, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Compact Linear Fresnel Reflector is a solar thermal energy system currently at prototype stage in Australia. The system uses parallel rows of mirrors lined up underneath a long, elevated thermal absorber. The mirrors move so as to focus solar radiation onto the absorber; the absorber contains a bank of high-pressure water pipes through which water is pumped and gradually boils. The process of ??direct steam generation?? in very long pipes, up to 300 m in a straight run, has not previously been performed at this scale; other systems use shorter pipe runs, or use other fluids such as non-boiling oil. This thesis addresses a broad range of design issues relating to the CLFR prototype and its components. Beam solar radiation at the prototype site is estimated from available data including satellite-derived and ground-based measurements. Existing correlations for the beam component of global radiation do not apply well to Australian conditions so a new correlation is proposed.  Computational fluid dynamics simulations establish radiative heat-loss as the dominant mode for the thermal absorber. Results are gathered for a range of sizes and shapes, and heat-loss correlations are derived for use in subsequent simulation.  Two-phase flow in the absorber direct-steam-generation process is examined, and a detailed model including, pipe-friction pressure drops, flow-boiling heat transfer and cavity heat loss is presented, with validation against the experimental results of other workers. A series of ??performance maps?? give the predicted outlet flow regime for varied inlet conditions, allowing selection of desired operating points.  A full system model is given that integrates this absorber model with ancillary components including the pump and connecting pipework; the model is used to evaluate pumping requirements and to establish expected operating conditions. The inherent pressure instability arising from the two phase flow is examined and orifice plates are sizes to stabilise this effect.  A dynamic model for the absorber pipe flow using fully implicit finite difference techniques and accurate IAPWS-IF97 steam properties gives the predicted behaviour during solar transients at both long and short time-scales.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermal</field><field name="subject">energy</field><field name="subject">solar</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbothermal solid state reduction of manganese oxide and ores in different gas atmospheres</field><field name="creator">Kononov, Ring, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of the project was to establish rate and mechanisms of solid state reduction of manganese ores. The project studied carbothermal reduction of manganese oxide MnO, two Groote Eylandt (Australian) and Wessels (South African) manganese ores in hydrogen, helium and argon atmospheres at temperatures up to 1400C for MnO and 1200C for manganese ores. Experiments were conducted in the fixed bed reactor with on-line off-gas analysis. The major findings are as follows. ??	Rate and degree of reduction of MnO and ores increased with increasing temperature. ??	Reduction of MnO and manganese ores at temperatures up to 1200C was faster in helium than in argon, and much faster in hydrogen than in helium. The difference in MnO reduction in hydrogen and helium decreased with increasing temperature to 1400C. ??	Addition of up to 7 vol% of carbon monoxide to hydrogen had no effect on MnO reduction at 1200C. ??	In the process of carbothermal reduction of ores in hydrogen at 1200C, silica was reduced. ??	Reduction of both GE ores was slower than of Wessels ore. This was attributed to high content of iron oxide in the Wessels ore. ??	Carbon content in the graphite-ore mixture had a strong effect on phases formed in the process of reduction; thus, in the reduction of Wessels ore with 12-16 wt% C, a-Mn and Mn23C6 were formed; when carbon content was above 20 wt%, oxides were reduced to carbide (Mn,Fe)7C3. ??	Kinetic analysis showed that mass transfer of intermediate CO2 from oxide to graphite in carbothermal reduction in inert atmosphere was a contributing factor in the rate control. ??	High rate of reduction of manganese oxide in hydrogen was attributed to formation of methane which facilitated mass transfer of carbon from graphite to oxide. Hydrogen was also directly involved in reduction of manganese ore reducing iron oxides to metallic iron and higher manganese oxides to MnO. Reduction of Wessels and Groote Eyland Premium Fines ores in the solid state is feasible at temperatures up to 1200C; while temperature for solid state reduction of Groote Eyland Premium Sands is limited by 1100C.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">manganese oxide</field><field name="subject">carbothermal solid state reduction</field><field name="subject">carbothermal reduction</field><field name="subject">Groote Eylandt</field><field name="subject">Wessels</field><field name="subject">manganese ore</field><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">helium</field><field name="subject">argon</field><field name="subject">manganese carbide</field><field name="subject">manganese iron silicon carbides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of footwear on balance and gait in older people</field><field name="creator">Menant, Jasmine Charlotte Christiane, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although footwear has been recognised as a risk factor for falls in older people, it remains unclear as to which features of shoes are beneficial or detrimental to balance. This project aimed to systematically investigate the effects of common shoe features, namely: an elevated heel, a soft sole, a hard sole, a flared sole, a bevelled heel, a high-collar and a tread sole, on balance and gait in older community-dwelling people. The experimental shoes were compared to standard shoes in three studies examining: (i) standing balance, leaning balance and stepping in 29 older people, (ii) centre of mass (COM)-base of support (BOS) margins, vertical and braking loading rates, and perceived shoe comfort and stability in 11 young and 15 older people walking on even and uneven surfaces, and (iii) temporal-spatial gait variables, pelvis acceleration, and gait termination in 10 young and 26 older people, on level, irregular and wet surfaces. Elevated heel shoes impaired overall performance in functional tests of balance and stepping. They were also perceived as lacking comfort and stability and led to a conservative walking pattern characterised by increased step width and double-support time, reduced braking and vertical loading rates and medio-lateral (ML) pelvis accelerations on various surfaces. Soft sole shoes increased lateral COM-BOS margin and step width, indicating reduced ML walking stability. When wearing these shoes, subjects had longer total stopping times and on the wet surface, smaller step lengths and shoe/floor angles at heel strike, suggesting a potential risk of slipping. When wearing high-collar shoes, subjects had better balance as demonstrated by small but significant increases in lateral COM-BOS margin, double-support time and step width, and decreases in ML pelvis accelerations on varying surfaces and in total stopping time on the wet surface. Shoes with hard, flared or tread soles or a bevelled heel did not affect balance. In conclusion, providing that they are fitted, have adequate fastening and perhaps a slip-resistant sole, shoes with a low square heel, a sole of medium hardness (shore A-40) and a high-collar provide the greatest stability for older people when walking on dry, wet and irregular surfaces.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Footwear</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="subject">Balance</field><field name="subject">Falls</field><field name="subject">Gait disorders in old age</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informal  and formal caring strategies of female carers in two CALD communities</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Annette Kathy, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study, completed in 2008, aims to address gaps in the literature on caring concerning the reluctance of CALD communities in Australia to use formal care. It hypothesises that broader cultural considerations, rather than merely language barriers and lack of information, are responsible for the preference of CALD communities for informal care. The literature on caring, mediated by certain aspects of Bourdieu??s habitus, is employed as a conceptual framework to analyse the informal and formal strategies employed by carers from the Italian and Greek speaking communities. The study concludes that habitus, informed by cultural factors, influences both the means of access to formal care and the type of formal care acceptable to these communities but differs between communities and between generations within each community. However,second and third order influences can lead to modification of habitus and caring strategies</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carers</field><field name="subject">Care</field><field name="subject">CALD</field><field name="subject">Caring</field><field name="subject">Caregivers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation studies of mass transfer under steady and unsteady fluid flow in two- and three-dimensional spacer-filled channels</field><field name="creator">Fimbres Weihs, Gustavo Adolfo, UNESCO Centre for Membrane Science &amp; Technology, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane (SWM) modules are the most common commercially available membrane modules. The latter dominate especially for RO, NF and UF and are the focus of this study. The main difficulty these types of modules face is concentration polarisation. In SWM modules, the spacer meshes that keep the membrane leaves apart also help reduce the effects of concentration polarisation. The spacer filaments act as flow obstructions, and thus encourage flow destabilisation and increase mass transfer enhancement. One of the detrimental aspects of the use of spacers is an increase of pressure losses in SWM modules. This study analyses the mechanisms that give rise to mass transfer enhancement in narrow spacer-filled channels, and investigates the relationship between flow destabilisation, energy losses and mass transfer. It shows that the regions of high mass transfer on the membrane surface correlate mainly with those regions where the fluid flow is towards the membrane. Based on the insights gained from this analysis, a series of multi-layer spacer designs are proposed and evaluated. In this thesis, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to simulate steady and unsteady flows with mass transfer in two- and three-dimensional narrow channels containing spacers. A solute with a Schmidt number of 600 dissolving from the wall and channel Reynolds numbers up to 1683 were considered. A fully-developed concentration profile boundary condition was utilised in order to reduce the computational costs of the simulations. Time averaging and Fourier analysis were performed to gain insight into the dynamics of the different flow regimes encountered, ranging from steady flow to vortex shedding behind the spacer filaments. The relationships between 3D flow effects, vortical flow, pressure drop and mass transfer enhancement were explored. Greater mass transfer enhancement was found for the 3D geometries modelled, when compared with 2D geometries, due to wall shear perpendicular to the bulk flow and streamwise vortices. Form drag was identified as the main component of energy loss for the flow conditions analysed. Implications for the design of improved spacer meshes, such as extra layers of spacer filaments to direct the bulk flow towards the membrane walls, and filament profiles to reduce form drag are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spiral Wound Module</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">Membrane</field><field name="subject">Spacer</field><field name="subject">Mass transfer -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circulating neutrophil activation and recruitment during the systemic inflammatory response to cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation</field><field name="creator">Orr, Yishay, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Circulating neutrophil activation occurs during cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and is implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory tissue injury and peri-operative organ dysfunction. However, neutrophil directed antiinflammatory strategies have failed to demonstrate consistent therapeutic benefit indicating that the nature and significance of peri-operative circulating neutrophil activation remains incompletely defined. In particular, conformational activation of the b2 integrin Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), which is required for neutrophil adhesion competence and facilitation of effector functions, has not previously been investigated during cardiac surgery, and the relative contribution of cellular activation and bone marrow neutrophil recruitment to peri-operative changes in circulating neutrophil phenotype and function is unknown. A novel whole blood flow cytometric technique was used to analyze circulating neutrophil phenotype (total Mac-1, conformationally-active CD11b, CD10, CD16, L-selectin and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1) and function in cardiac surgery patients to characterize the nature of changes in Mac-1 expression and activation status, and the effects of relative neutrophil immaturity on circulating neutrophil phenotype and function. The effect of heparin, a known CD11b ligand, on Mac-1 epitope expression was also investigated. Circulating neutrophil numbers observed during ECC were mathematically modeled to determine the acute response of the bone marrow neutrophil reserve to an inflammatory stimulus. Plasma cytokine, chemokine and acute phase mediators were measured in cardiac and lung surgery patients to determine potential regulators of systemic neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophils newlyemergent from the bone marrow were characterized as CD10-/CD16low and exhibited distinct changes in cell surface markers and enhanced functional responses, relative to their more mature CD10+ counterparts. Conformational activation of CD11b occurred peri-operatively and provided a more sensitive measure of circulating neutrophil activation status than changes in total Mac-1 or L-selectin expression, although detection of Mac-1 epitopes was reduced in the presence of heparin. Modeling of circulating neutrophil numbers predicted that post-mitotic maturation time was acutely abbreviated by 8.4 hours during 71 minutes of ECC. Systemic chemokine release occurred with cardiac but not non-cardiac thoracic surgery indicating some specificity of the acute inflammatory response. These findings expand the understanding of peri-operative circulating neutrophil activation and recruitment, and identify potential therapeutic targets to limit neutrophil injurious potential during cardiac surgery with ECC.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrins</field><field name="subject">Neutrophils</field><field name="subject">Extracorporeal circulation</field><field name="subject">Bone marrow</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41227</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel antagonists of bacterial signaling pathways</field><field name="creator">Goh, Wai Kean, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Traditional bacterial disease therapies utilize compounds that ultimately kill the target bacteria but it exerts a strong selective pressure on the bacteria to develop multi-drug resistance mutants. The increasing occurrence of resistance in common pathogens has highlighted the need to identify new anti-microbials that target the control of bacterial pathogenicity in a non-extermination manner to reduce the incidence of bacteria resistance. One new strategy exploits the discrete signaling molecules that regulate the various bacterial signaling pathways, which are responsible for the expression of pathogenicity traits. Halogenated furanones (fimbrolides) from the marine red alga, Delisea pulchra have been shown to interfere with the key signaling pathway present in Gram-negative bacteria by competitively displacing the cognate signaling molecule from the transcription protein. This project focused on the design and synthesis of 1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones, a new class of fimbrolide derivatives capable of displaying strong antagonistic properties of the fimbrolides. Primary synthetic methodologies examined include the halolactamization of allenamides and the direct lactone-lactam transformation. No doubt, both methodologies yielded the lactam ring, the former failed to introduce the crucial C-5 bromomethylene group essential for bioactivity. A facile high yielding two-step lactone-lactam transformation method was developed and using this method, a wide range of substituted 5-bromomethyl- and 5-dibromomethylene-1,5-dihydropyrrol-2-ones were synthesized. Furthermore, a new class of tricyclic crown-ether type compounds with no literature precedent were discovered.  To vary the diversity of the compounds, a related class of compounds, 5,6-dihydroindol-2-ones, were examined.  A general versatile method for the synthesis of 7-substituted 5,6-dihydroindol-2-ones was developed. The synthetic strategy proceeds via the established Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of halogenated dihydroindol-2-ones with arylboronic acids/esters. The Suzuki methodology was found to be reliable in furnishing a wide range of 7-substituted products in high yields. A preliminary molecular modeling approach was used to assist in the design of new anti-microbials via the ligand-docking analyses of the TraR and LasR protein. A positive correlation was observed between the docking scores and biological activity and the methodology was further developed into an initial screening tool to filter potential active and non-active compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were analysed for their efficacy in reducing the expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in the presence of natural AHL signaling molecules in an AHL-monitor strain, indicative of the inhibition of bacterial phenotype expression. The dihydropyrrol-2-one class of compounds showed significant biological activity and this highlighted their potential for further development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dihydroindolone</field><field name="subject">Quorum Sensing</field><field name="subject">Dihydropyrrolone</field><field name="subject">Molecular Modeling</field><field name="subject">AHL Receptor Binding</field><field name="subject">TraR</field><field name="subject">LasR</field><field name="subject">Antibacterial agents</field><field name="subject">Chemical inhibitors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of heterocyclic analogues of phytoestrogens</field><field name="creator">Leu, Chao-Wei, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-6-one ring system was synthesised from 3-aryl-4,6-dimethoxyindoles and 2,3-disubstituted-4,6-dimethoxyindoles. The reaction of 4,6-dimethoxyindoles under Friedel-Crafts or Vilsmeier-Haack acylation gave the 2- and 7-indolyldeoxybenzoins in good yield. Cyclisation of 7-indolyldeoxybenzoins with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal as a one carbon reagent gave the pyrroloquinolin-6-ones in high yield. Reduction of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with hydrogen gas and 10% palladium on carbon or lithium aluminium hydride yielded the dihydropyrroloquinolin-6-ones. Demethylation of pyrroloquinolin-6-ones with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid gave a mixture of the monohydroxy and dihydroxy analogues in high yield. The synthesis of quinolin-4-ones using the Conrad-Limpach method was attempted using three different cyclisation conditions such as Dowtherm A, polyphosphoric acid and a mixture of diphenyl ether and methanesulfonic acid. Quinolin-2-ones such as 4-methyl-3-aryl-, 3,4-diaryl- and 3-aryl-4-benzyl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones could be synthesised from either the N-phenylacetylaniline or the N-trifluoroacetyl aniline strategy. Attempted reduction of the quinolin-2-ones with standard metal hydride reagents was unsuccessful. However reduction was achieved via the conversion of quinolin-2-one to the corresponding 2-chloroquinoline followed by reaction of the chloroquinoline with zinc powder and glacial acetic acid to produce a novel, highly substituted quinoline system. Demethylation was successfully carried out with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid to give the trihydroxyquinolin-2-one in high yield. The reactions of 4-substituted-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones and the corresponding 2-chloroquinolines as potential organic intermediates were explored. Facile formylation of both quinolin-2-ones and 2-chloroquinolines was observed under Vilsmeier-Haack conditions while acetylation was successful under Friedel-Crafts conditions using antimony (V) pentachloride as the Lewis acid. Further reaction of 8-formyl-quinolin-2-one with 1,2-diaminobenzene in N,N-dimethylformamide led to the formation of a new 8-(benzimidazolyl)-quinolin-2-one ring system. The quinolin-2-ones exhibited selective electrophilic substitution at the C8 position for a range of reactions. However, an unexpected nitration occurred at the C3 position for the 4-methoxy and 4-phenyl-5,7-dimethoxyquinolin-2-ones with good yields. A series of novel 4,6-hydroxylindoles was successfully synthesised from the corresponding methoxy analogues in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride. When 3-(4-bromophenyl)-4,6-dimethoxyindole was reacted with 48% hydrobromic acid in glacial acetic acid a 2,2?-indolylindoline dimer was formed. The 5,7-dihydroxyquinolin-2-ones were similarly synthesised in high yield using anhydrous aluminium chloride in chlorobenzene.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phytoestrogens</field><field name="subject">Heterocyclic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on testing some predictions of RBC models and the stationarity of real interest rates</field><field name="creator">Ji, Inyeob, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains a series of essays that provide empirical evidence for Australia on some fundamental predictions of real business cycle models and on the convergence and persistence of real interest rates. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the issues examined in each chapter and provides an overview of the methodologies that are used. Tests of various basic predictions of standard real business cycle models for Australia are presented in Chapters 2, 3 and 4. Chapter 2 considers the question of great ratios for Australia. These are ratios of macroeconomic variables that are predicted by standard models to be stationary in the steady state. Using time series econometric techniques (unit root tests and cointegration tests) Australia great ratios are examined. In Chapter 3 a more restrictive implication of real business cycle models than the existence of great ratios is considered.  Following the methodology proposed by Canova, Finn and Pagan (1994) the equilibrium decision rules for some standard real business cycle are tested on Australian data. The final essay on this topic is presented in Chapter 4.  In this chapter a large-country, small-country is used to try and understand the reason for the sharp rise in Australia??s share of world output that began around 1990.  Chapter 5 discusses real interest rate linkages in the Pacific Basin region. Vector autoregressive models and bootstrap methods are adopted to study financial linkages between East Asian markets, Japan and US. Given the apparent non-stationarity of real interest rates a related issue is examined in Chapter 6, viz. the persistence of international real interest rates and estimation of their half-life. Half-life is selected as a means of measuring persistence of real rates. Bootstrap methods are employed to overcome small sample issues in the estimation and a non-standard statistical inference methodology (Highest Density Regions) is adopted. Chapter 7 reapplies the High Density Regions methodology and bootstrap half-life estimation to the data used in Chapters 2 and 5. This provides a robustness check on the results of standard unit root tests that were applied to the data in those chapters.    Main findings of the thesis are as follows. The long run implications of real business cycle models are largely rejected by the Australia data. This finding holds for both the existence of great ratios and when the explicit decision rules are employed. When the small open economy features of the Australian economy are incorporated in a two country RBC model, a country-specific productivity boom seems to provide a possible explanation for the rise in Australia??s share of world output. The essays that examine real interest rates suggest the following results. Following the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 there appears to have been a decline in the importance of Japan in influencing developments in the Pacific Basin region. In addition there is evidence that following the crisis Korea??s financial market became less insular and more integrated with the US. Finally results obtained from the half-life estimators suggest that despite the usual findings from unit root tests, real interest rates may in fact exhibit mean-reversion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real interest rate</field><field name="subject">RBC</field><field name="subject">Small open economy</field><field name="subject">Interest rates -- Australia -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Macroeconomics -- Econometric models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extinction of conditioned fear in the developing rat</field><field name="creator">Kim, Jee Hyun, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present thesis examined extinction of conditioned fear in the developing rat. In the adult rat, the hippocampus is thought to be important for the context-specificity of extinction. Because the hippocampus is a late-maturing structure, it was hypothesised that context-modulation of extinction may be different across development. The first series of experiments investigated reinstatement of extinguished fear in the developing rat (Chapter 2). The results showed that P24 rats exhibited context-specific reinstatement. On the other hand, P17 rats did not exhibit reinstatement of extinguished fear following a US reminder treatment. The failure to see reinstatement in P17 rats was not due to the reminder treatment being ineffective in these rats because the same treatment alleviated spontaneous forgetting in rat this age. The second series of experiments then examined the renewal effect and GABAergic involvement in extinction in P24 and P17 rats (Chapter 3). It was observed that P24 rats displayed renewal whereas P17 rats did not. Also, pre-test injection of FG7142 recovered extinguished fear in P24 rats but not in P17 rats, even across a range of doses. This failure to see any FG7142 effect on extinction in P17 rats was not due to the lack of responsiveness to this drug in these rats because FG7142 was found to be effective in alleviating spontaneous forgetting in rats this age. The third series of experiments then examined the effect of temporary inactivation of the amygdala on extinction and re-extinction in the developing rat (Chapter 4). It was observed that extinction retention is impaired in both P24 and P17 rats if the amygdala is inactivated during extinction training. Interestingly, when a CS that had been previously extinguished and then re-trained was re-extinguished, re-extinction was amygdala-independent if initial extinction occurred at 24 days of age but amygdala-dependent if initial extinction occurred at 17 days of age. That is, amygdala involvement in re-extinction was dissociated across development. Taken together, these experiments provide strong evidence for fundamental differences in mechanisms underlying fear extinction across development. The implications of the findings were discussed in light of the theoretical and neural models of extinction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extinction</field><field name="subject">Fear</field><field name="subject">Rat</field><field name="subject">Pavlovian Conditioning</field><field name="subject">Unlearning</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Extinction (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Fear -- Psychology</field><field name="subject">Rats -- Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incorporating discontinuities in value-at-risk via the poisson jump diffusion model and variance gamma model</field><field name="creator">Lee, Brendan Chee-Seng, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">We utilise several asset pricing models that allow for discontinuities in the returns and volatility time series in order to obtain estimates of Value-at-Risk (VaR). The first class of model that we use mixes a continuous diffusion process with discrete jumps at random points in time (Poisson Jump Diffusion Model). We also apply a purely discontinuous model that does not contain any continuous component at all in the underlying distribution (Variance Gamma Model). These models have been shown to have some success in capturing certain characteristics of return distributions, a few being leptokurtosis and skewness. Calibrating these models onto the returns of an index of Australian stocks (All Ordinaries Index), we then use the resulting parameters to obtain daily estimates of VaR. In order to obtain the VaR estimates for the Poisson Jump Diffusion Model and the Variance Gamma Model, we introduce the use of an innovation from option pricing techniques, which concentrates on the more tractable characteristic functions of the models. Having then obtained a series of VaR estimates, we then apply a variety of criteria to assess how each model performs and also evaluate these models against the traditional approaches to calculating VaR, such as that suggested by J.P. Morgan???s RiskMetrics. Our results show that whilst the Poisson Jump Diffusion model proved the most accurate at the 95% VaR level, neither the Poisson Jump Diffusion or Variance Gamma models were dominant in the other performance criteria examined. Overall, no model was clearly superior according to all the performance criteria analysed, and it seems that the extra computational time required to calibrate the Poisson Jump Diffusion and Variance Gamma models for the purposes of VaR estimation do not provide sufficient reward for the additional effort than that currently employed by Riskmetrics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Variance Gamma Model.</field><field name="subject">Value at risk.</field><field name="subject">Jump Diffusion Model.</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment.</field><field name="subject">Pricing -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Poisson distribution.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lexicographic path searches for FPGA routing</field><field name="creator">So, Keith Kam-Ho, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation reports on studies of the application of lexicographic graph searches to solve problems in FPGA detailed routing. Our contributions include the derivation of iteration limits for scalar implementations of negotiation congestion for standard floating point types and the identification of pathological cases for path choice. In the study of the routability-driven detailed FPGA routing problem, we show universal detailed routability is NP-complete based on a related proof by Lee and Wong. We describe the design of a lexicographic composition operator of totally-ordered monoids as path cost metrics and show its optimality under an adapted A* search. Our new router, CornNC, based on lexicographic composition of congestion and wirelength, established a new minimum track count for the FPGA Place and Route Challenge. For the problem of long-path timing-driven FPGA detailed routing, we show that long-path budgeted detailed routability is NP-complete by reduction to universal detailed routability. We generalise the lexicographic composition to any finite length and verify its optimality under A* search. The application of the timing budget solution of Ghiasi et al. is used to solve the long-path timing budget problem for FPGA connections. Our delay-clamped spiral lexicographic composition design, SpiralRoute, ensures connection based budgets are always met, thus achieves timing closure when it successfully routes. For 113 test routing instances derived from standard benchmarks, SpiralRoute found 13 routable instances with timing closure that were unroutable by a scalar negotiated congestion router and achieved timing closure in another 27 cases when the scalar router did not, at the expense of increased runtime. We also study techniques to improve SpiralRoute runtimes, including a data structure of a trie augmented by data stacks for minimum element retrieval, and the technique of step tomonoid elimination in reducing the retrieval depth in a trie of stacks structure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical design</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">Routing (Computer network management)</field><field name="subject">Negotiated congestion</field><field name="subject">Lexicographic path search</field><field name="subject">Lexicography -- Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthracyclines used in the treatment of cancer: their harmful effects on the Reno-cardiovascular connection</field><field name="creator">Bedja, Djahida, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: The molecular and cellular mechanisms corresponding to the compensatory and maladaptive hypertrophy and remodeling of the left ventricle with chronic doxorubicin (DOX) treatment are currently unclear. Non-invasive methods of determining these changes are still deficient. To investigate these changes, 8 groups of rats in 4 different studies including a control saline group of the same age, gender and strain were evaluated for cardiac morphology and function including: (1) DOX dose response using a cumulative dose of 7.5mg/kg, and 15mg/kg in 8-10 week old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, (2) strain differences were investigated in response to a cumulative dose of 15mg/kg in 8-10 week old female Fisher (F344) rats compared to the SD rats treated with same dose, (3) the role of gender and aging were studied in response to DOX at a cumulative dose of 3mg/kg in male and female neonates,  and (4) combined losartan and a cumulative dose of 15mg/kg of DOX in 8-10 week old female SD rats compared to controls of saline and 15mg/kg treated SD rats.  Method: Onset of cardiac toxicity was assessed by echocardiography and the rat model of heart failure was developed when the fractional shortening declined &#8804; 40%. The mean arterial pressure and single-photon-emission computer tomography scanning and Tc-99m-HYNIC-Annexin V were performed at week 10 to analyze blood pressure and quantify apoptosis, respectively. All rats were euthanized at week 10 except for the neonates and two of the 7.5mg/kg-treated SD rats that were left alive for study of long -term cardiac side effects. The heart and kidney tissues were harvested for protein isolation and histopathological studies. Blood samples were collected for hematological and lipid profile analysis in all the rats. Results: A dose- and time-dependent increase in LVmass coincided with a parallel increase in MAP, kidney damage, expression of myocardial erbB2, heat shock protein 90 Akt, mTOR, GSK-3&#946;, TGF-&#946;, pSMAD2, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in SD rats treated with 7.5mg/kg and 15mg/kg of DOX at week 10. The 7.5 kg/kg treatment showed adaptive hypertrophy whereas the 15mg/kg treatment group showed maladaptive hypertrophy. However decompensation was apparent by week 14 in other rats treated with 7.5mg/kg. LVmass, FS, MAP, kidney damage, red blood cells and blood lipid levels were not significantly altered in the F344 rats compared to the 15 mg/kg-treated SD rats. Losartan supplementation reduced the left ventricular hypertrophy, improved myocardial contractility, and reduced TGF-&#946; expression compared to the DOX-treated SD rats. The 3mg/kg of DOX in neonates induced cardiac toxicity and deaths in about 60% of males 50 weeks after treatment; the females instead developed mammary tumors. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that age, gender, and strain differences are risks factors for doxorubicin-induced harmful reno-cardiovascular toxicity. The inhibition of TGF-&#946; expression by losartan can be used in prevention of chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity without interfering with its anti-tumor activities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tc-99m-HYNIC-Annexin V</field><field name="subject">Doxorubicin</field><field name="subject">Echocardiography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of steel and steel-concrete composite beams and beam-to-column connections at elevated temperatures</field><field name="creator">Heidarpour , Amin , Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current research work investigates the behaviour of steel and composite beams as well as beam-to-column connections at elevated temperatures.  Significant attention is needed to identify the main issues, as the behaviour is profoundly different from that at ambient temperature.  Local buckling of the beam flange outstands has been found to be highly significant in accelerating the development of catenary action in fire, since this action is reliant on hinges forming which may result from local buckling.  Local buckling of the beam web, which experiences a non-uniform temperature variation, is also important because the mechanical properties of the steel are degraded non-uniformly from their ambient values. Current formulations for web buckling at ambient temperature therefore need substantial revision at elevated temperatures. Very large compressive forces are developed within the beams initially and these induce large stresses in the column web; hitherto this has not been considered.  Developing a formulation representing the mechanics of this potential failure zone in the column web in the compression region of the connection is a useful and needed addition to research in the topic. Predicting the critical temperature in a connection that causes failure of the bolts, end plate and column flange in the tension zone of the connection is considered in this research work. An elastic analysis of a panel zone in a rigid or semi-rigid joint in a steel frame, which is based on simple equilibrium considerations that takes into account the shear and flexural deformations of the panel zone, is developed at elevated temperatures. In order to model the structural response of a composite beam restrained by cooler members in a steel compartment fire in a frame structure at elevated temperature, recourse is needed to a geometric nonlinear formulation, since the beam transverse deflections are not negligible and the axial compressive force in the member is also substantial at the early stages of the fire. This thesis presents such a formulation, which incorporates partial interaction between the concrete slab and steel component, as well as the degradation of the stiffnesses of the components of the composite beam prior to yield at elevated temperature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Connection</field><field name="subject">Steel</field><field name="subject">Composite beam</field><field name="subject">Elevated temperatures</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular regulation and enhancement of megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis by the p45 subunit of NF-E2.</field><field name="creator">Fock, Ee-Ling, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Megakaryocytes (MKs) are a rare population of haematopoietic cells, which produce platelets. Platelet production is a complex process that is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by lineage specific transcription factors such as p45 NF-E2. Understanding how transcriptional regulators operate is imperative to advance our knowledge of disease pathophysiology and to propose novel treatment options. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: i) study the effects of p45 NF-E2 overexpression on various stages of megakaryopoiesis; (ii) elucidate the nuclear transport mechanisms of p45 NF-E2; and iii) determine the impact of a p45 NF-E2 modification called SUMOylation on thrombopoiesis.  Exogenous p45 NF-E2 was overexpressed in haematopoietic cells in culture and various aspects of megakaryopoiesis were examined. Overexpression of p45 NF-E2 enhanced multiple stages of MK differentiation such as colony forming unit (CFU)-MK formation and terminal MK maturation. Most importantly, p45 NF-E2 overexpression resulted in significant increases in proplatelet and functional platelet production in vitro. This latter result was confirmed in vivo using lethally irradiated mice transplanted with cells that overexpressed p45 NF-E2. Unexpectedly, the enhancement of MK differentiation was at the expense of myeloid development and, for the first time, identified p45 NF-E2 as a negative regulator of myeloid differentiation.  Secondly, we determined the nuclear localisation signal of p45-NF-E2 and the pathway responsible for nuclear import. We also investigated the importance of p45 NF-E2 nuclear import in thrombopoiesis. Finally, we showed that p45 NF-E2 is modified mainly by SUMO-2/3 in bone marrow cells and this process is involved in the transcriptional activation of MK-specific genes and platelet release.  Taken together, these results suggest that enforced expression of p45 NF-E2 selectively enhances many aspects of MK differentiation including early and terminal MK maturation, proplatelet formation and platelet release. Equally important, this thesis also indicates that white blood cell differentiation may be inhibited by p45 overexpression, while molecular processes such as the nuclear import and SUMOylation of p45 NF-E2 are vital for thrombopoiesis. These observations will facilitate subsequent studies into the feasibility of manipulating p45 NF-E2 protein levels for the treatment of conditions such as thrombocytopaenia and other platelet disorders.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thrombopoiesis</field><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes</field><field name="subject">NF-E2</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of non-linear features in the business cycle</field><field name="creator">Engel, James, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Writers on the business cycle often emphasize that non-linear models are needed to account for certain of its features. Thus it is often said that either the asymmetry of the duration of business cycle expansions and contractions or the variability of these quantities demand a non-linear model. Such comments are rarely made precise however and mostly consist of references to such assertions from the past. Thus the asymmetry in the cycle is mostly accompanied by references to Keynes (1936) and Burns and Mitchell (1946). But these authors were looking at what we call today the classical cycle i.e. movements in the level of GDP, and so the fact that there are long expansions and short contractions can arise simply due to the presence of long-run growth in the economy, and it is not obvious that it has much to do with non-linearity. This thesis aims to introduce various statistics that can be used to characterise the specific shape of the non-linearity observed in macroeconomic time series. Chapter 2 introduces a range of statistics and presents the dating algorithm used in this thesis, which is based on the BBQ algorithm of Harding and Pagan (2002). Chapter 3 tests the adequacy of linear models versus the SETAR model of van Dijk and Franses(2003) and the bounceback model of Kim, Morley and Piger (2005) in capturing observed non-linear features of the data. Chapter 4 extends this work by examining the three state Markov model of Hamilton (1989), again using the ??bounce-back?? model of Kim C., Morley, J. and J. Piger, (2005), and the more complicated ??tension?? model of DeJong, D., Dharmarajan, H., Liesenfeld, R. and Richard, J., (2005). Chapter 4 also extends Chapter 3 by estimating the above mentioned models on US GDP, Australian non-farm GDP, US investment and Australian dwellings investment. They are then simulated in order to gauge the cycle properties. Chapter 5 analyses the business cycle implications of two related multivariate dynamic factor models presented in papers by Kim and Piger (2001, 2002).

Equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) is a useful process for producing these types of structures whereby the material is deformed to very high plastic strains by passing a billet several times through the ECAP die. This process has an added advantage maintaining the initial dimensions of the billet. SMG materials produced by ECAP and related routes are useful as they usually exhibit excellent properties including high strength and hardness, and excellent superplastic formability: these and other properties make SMG materials useful for industrial and aerospace applications. In this thesis, a binary aluminium alloy containing a very low concentration of scandium (0.1 wt. %) Sc alloy was investigated and compared with higher Sc-containing alloys. The material was deformed by ECAP in the solution treated condition to an equivalent von Mises strain of 9.2 then pre-aged at 250 0C to generate a submicron grained material containing a relatively uniform dispersion of nanosized Al3Sc dispersiods. The thermal stability of this pre-aged microstructure was investigated by annealing at temperatures up to 450 0C resulted in continuous grain coarsening by the process of continuous recrystallization whereby the initial microstructure evolves gradually with no marked change in the grain size distribution, texture and grain boundary character. However, extended annealing (&gt; 1h) at 4500 C resulted in discontinuous grain coarsening (often termed recrystallization) whereby a few grains grow rapidly to eventually produce a coarse-grained final microstructure. Throughout annealing, there was a good correlation between the dispersion parameter, (f/d) where f and d is the volume fraction and the mean diameter of Al3Sc particles in the alloy, respectively, and both the mean grain size (D ) and D /D max where max D is the maximum grain diameter observed in the microstructure. The grain structure was found to undergo moderate coarsening at the high f/d-values but converted to a coarsegrained structure for f/d ~&lt;0.5/&#956;m, and this change occurred when the mean grain diameter was ~ 3-4&#956;m. Hence, the critical value of the dispersion parameter for the transition from continuous to discontinuous coarsening falls between the theoretical value for submicron grain size alloys (f/d ~ 1.5/&#956;m) and the value found for conventionally-deformed alloys (f/d ~ 0.1/&#956;m). This behaviour is the result of the alloy no longer being ultra-fine grained at the onset of discontinuous coarsening.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recrystallization</field><field name="subject">Super Plastic Deformation</field><field name="subject">Submicron grain</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A landscape of compliance, conflict and invention - an administrative history of the New South Wales Treasury, 1824??1976</field><field name="creator">Carew, Roberta Ann, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ministerial responsibility is a corollary of the democratic process. An administrative component of that democratic expression is the Treasury. Federal, state or national treasuries have always played pivotal roles in the political, economic, social, technical and cultural evolution of the political arenas within which they function. This thesis presents, for the first time, an institutional history of the New South Wales Treasury. It includes an analysis of its British antecedents, its establishment in the penal colony of New South Wales, by way of the Commissariat and Colonial Funds, and its subsequent development into one of the most influential State government departments. What is fundamental to the successful and efficient administration of a Treasury in the twenty-first century was also true five thousand years ago. There is a universality of constant principles applying to the administration of the public purse and those principles have not altered over the millennia: security, accountability, transparency, efficiency and control. A component of a modern Treasury is its advisory capacity in financial matters. This thesis, therefore, examines the application of those constants in the context of New South Wales over the previous one hundred and fifty years, 1824 to 1976. The New South Wales Treasury is examined specifically, as the vehicle for the adaptation and application of those constant principles attaching to the financial administration of the public purse. An examination is also made of the growth of Treasury??s internal structure, leadership, modus operandi, its response to administrative reform and its role in the public service. The inter-play between Treasury, Governors, Colonial Treasurers, and the public service are all vial elements in this exposition of Treasury. This history, therefore, analyses and dissects the influences that provided the impetus for a government agency to develop successfully, from a modest office of three in 1824, into the present day department of state.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General equilibrium effects of an alternative social security development in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sudarto, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates general equilibrium effects of an alternative social security policy in Indonesia. The study aims to analyse some financial issues of the proposed policy using a dynamic CGE model. The focus is investigating possible tax scenarios to finance the proposed policy and their impacts on the economy. The simulation results suggest that the consumption tax base should be used as the main financing method. This is because based on various simulations the selected consumption taxes have less negative impacts on the economy than the selected income taxes. Those selected consumption taxes more equitably distribute tax burden and improve income inequality in the long run. However, the increasing price because of this policy selection should also be considered seriously. The simulations also include the study of the demographic transition in Indonesia. A view that is common in the literature is that the rapid increase of labor force in the next three decades could raise the proportion of skilled workers in the labor force and enhance the economic growth. Instead the simulations suggest contrary results. When we repeat the tax/transfer simulations with the demographic transition, real GDP per capita and consumption per capita fall further below the baseline projections. Further simulations are conducted to investigate possible policy actions to mitigate the effects of this demographic transition. This study also covers possible allocation decision trade-offs surrounding the proposed social security policy. That is, the trade-offs between universal social pension insurance and universal social health insurance, and between universal tax-financed social security programs and other important development programs. Given the limitation of our study, that all stakeholders have agreed to develop a universal tax-financed social security program, we conclude that universal tax-financed social health insurance should be given more priority than universal tax-financed social pension insurance. The study concludes with some remarks regarding important areas for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social Security</field><field name="subject">Computable General Equilibrium</field><field name="subject">CGE</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatially reconfigurable and non-parametric representation of dynamic bayesian beliefs</field><field name="creator">Lavis, Benjamin Mark, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a means for representing and computing beliefs in the form of arbitrary probability density functions with a guarantee for the ongoing validity of such beliefs over indefinte time frames. The foremost aspect of this proposal is the introduction of a general, theoretical, solution to the guaranteed state estimation problem from within the recursive Bayesian estimation framework. The solution presented here determines the minimum space required, at each stage of the estimation process, to represent the belief with limited, or no, loss of information.  Beyond this purely theoretical aspect, a number of numerical techniques, capable of determining the required space and performing the appropriate spatial reconfiguration, whilst also computing and representing the belief functions, are developed. This includes a new, hybrid particle-element approach to recursive Bayesian estimation.  The advantage of spatial reconfiguration as presented here is that it ensures that the belief functions consider all plausible states of the target system, without altering the recursive Bayesian estimation equations used to form those beliefs. Furthermore, spatial reconfiguration as proposed in this dissertation enhances the estimation process since it allows computational resources to be concentrated on only those states considered plausible.  Autonomous maritime search and rescue is used as a focus application throughout this dissertation since the searching-and-tracking requirements of the problem involve uncertainty, the use of arbitrary belief functions and dynamic target systems. Nevertheless, the theoretical development in this dissertation has been kept general and independent of an application, and as such the theory and techniques presented here may be applied to any problem involving dynamic Bayesian beliefs.  A number of numerical experiments and simulations show the efficacy of the proposed spatially reconfigurable representations, not only in ensuring the validity of the belief functions over indefinite time frames, but also in reducing computation time and improving the accuracy of function approximation. Improvements of an order of magnitude were achieved when compared with traditional, spatially static representations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hybrid Particle-Element Approach</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic Robotics</field><field name="subject">Recursive Bayesian Estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theorising creative processes in the writing of the neo-historical fiction watermarks</field><field name="creator">Wakeling, Louise Kathering, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this dissertation, aspects of the creative process involved in `writing the past' are theorised from the site of practice, from the viewpoint of the empirical author. Certain poststructuralist and postmodernist discourses, however, have problematised and de-stabilised the concepts of `history' and the `past', and called into question the unitary and authoritative nature of `truth', `knowledge' and `reality'. These contestings of the ontological status of `history' have alerted us to the importance of previously marginalised perspectives on historical `reality', especially those relating to gender, race and religion.  This situation presents considerable challenges to the writer of historical fiction and the historian alike, rendering it difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct the `past' without irony. In the light of a general `crisis of representation', fiction purporting to deal with an increasingly elusive `past' can no longer proceed in the relatively uncomplicated manner of the traditional historical novel, with its emphasis on sustaining the referential illusion of the empirical `past', as though the `truth' of `past events' could be revealed `as it really was'.  Some of the options for re-writing history figurally are considered, and my novel Watermarks situated within them as a blend of traditional historical fiction, neo-historical or revisionary fiction, and the more extreme or satirical forms of historiographic metafiction which radically revise, challenge or subvert established ways of `writing the past'. The focus of the latter two forms is not so much on history as objective facts and artifacts, as on the pluralistic, and sometimes relativistic, concept of history as perspective(s).  The dissertation explores the genesis of Watermarks, the theoretical and practical implications of writing a neo-historical fiction, the difficulties of `writing the past', and the fictional strategies employed to address them. The metafictional strategies of framed narratives or inset tales, multiple (and sometimes unreliable) narrators, and transformative repetitions of prior texts (intertextuality) are examined in the light of Bakhtin's concept of the "dialogic of the imagination", and are shown to be an important means by which past worlds may be established and at the same time subverted in the discourse of the novel.  Each of these strategies re-affirms a view of `history' and the `past' as a matter of mediated and provisional `truths'. The role of intertextuality in particular is examined at length, firstly in terms of its theoretical implications for the traditional view of the author as originator of the text, and secondly in practical terms as an important means of producing a multivocal, interrogative text, a vital source of the diverse `languages' which characterise the discourse of the novel.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative writing</field><field name="subject">Historical fiction</field><field name="subject">Postmodernism</field><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Metafiction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wideband extension of narrowband speech for enhancement and coding</field><field name="creator">Epps, Julien, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most existing telephone networks transmit narrowband coded speech which has been bandlimited to 4 kHz. Compared with normal speech, this speech has a muffled quality and reduced intelligibility, which is particularly noticeable in sounds such as /s/, /f/ and /sh/. Speech which has been bandlimited to 8 kHz is often coded for this reason, but this requires an increase in the bit rate.  Wideband enhancement is a scheme that adds a synthesized highband signal to narrowband speech to produce a higher quality wideband speech signal. The synthesized highband signal is based entirely on information contained in the narrowband speech, and is thus achieved at zero increase in the bit rate from a coding perspective. Wideband enhancement can function as a post-processor to any narrowband telephone receiver, or alternatively it can be combined with any narrowband speech coder to produce a very low bit rate wideband speech coder. Applications include higher quality mobile, teleconferencing, and internet telephony. This thesis examines in detail each component of the wideband enhancement scheme:  highband excitation synthesis, highband envelope estimation, and narrowband-highband envelope continuity. Objective and subjective test measures are formulated to assess existing and new methods for all components, and the likely limitations to the performance of wideband enhancement are also investigated.  A new method for highband excitation synthesis is proposed that uses a combination of sinusoidal transform coding-based excitation and random excitation. Several new techniques for highband spectral envelope estimation are also developed. The performance of these techniques is shown to be approaching the limit likely to be achieved. Subjective tests demonstrate that wideband speech synthesized using these techniques has higher quality than the input narrowband speech.  Finally, a new paradigm for very low bit rate wideband speech coding is presented in which the quality of the wideband enhancement scheme is improved further by allocating a very small bitstream for highband envelope and gain coding. Thus, this thesis demonstrates that wideband speech can be communicated at or near the bit rate of a narrowband speech coder.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="subject">coding</field><field name="subject">coder</field><field name="subject">enhancement</field><field name="subject">quality</field><field name="subject">post-processor</field><field name="subject">wideband</field><field name="subject">highband</field><field name="subject">narrowband</field><field name="subject">estimation</field><field name="subject">bandwidth</field><field name="subject">extension</field><field name="subject">synthesis</field><field name="subject">envelope</field><field name="subject">quantization</field><field name="subject">bit rate</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of compulsory competitive tendering on the organisational culture of local government in Victoria</field><field name="creator">Aulich, Christopher, School of Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A central feature of public sector reform in Australia in the past decade or so has been the introduction of competition into service markets that were previously monopolised by public agencies. The adoption of more competitive strategies by these agencies has usually been accompanied by changes in their organisational culture - found in their structures, modes of operation and in internal and external relationships, as well as in the underlying values orientation of the organisation. The introduction of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) in local government in the state of Victoria reflected criticisms of the performance of traditional local government bureaucracies and a determination by the state government to secure a change in local government culture. This study investigates the impact of CCT on local authorities in Victoria, and explores the changes to organisational culture that have occurred. It assesses the extent to which the changes are consistent with a 'post-bureaucratic' conception of public organisations. The study presents evidence that cultural change has occurred in Victorian local authorities, particularly in the establishment of new organisation structures, a more entrepreneurial or outward focused orientation, and the development of more market focused and customer oriented service delivery systems. While cultural changes may not have progressed as far as intended by the Victorian government, they represent a more radical approach to local government reform than in other Australian states - so radical that they present a serious challenge to long-held views of the role of local government in the community. The thesis reveals that the new competitive environment may itself generate new problems such as transactions costs and erosion of trust within local councils and enables senior managers to assert stronger control over the council. It is this control, together with the technocratic or top-down approach to reform taken by the state government, which has constrained the development of model post-bureaucratic local government organisations in Victoria. In particular, it seems that senior managers are more intent on reshaping their organisations than in encouraging the greater market responsiveness anticipated in the post-bureaucratic model.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local government Victoria</field><field name="subject">Municipal services Contracting out Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health related quality of life of intensive care patients: Development of the Sydney quality of life questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Robert, School of Community Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has three main research aims. First the development of a questionnaire to measure HRQOL of ICU patients. Second, to examine a model of HRQOL proposed to assist with the development of the questionnaire. Third, to examine the HRQOL outcomes of patient after hospital discharge. The proposed model is based on a review of conceptual issues related to Quality of Life (QOL), Health Status and HRQOL. After a content analysis of a broad range of definitions of QOL, Health Status and HRQOL, QOL was defined as a dynamic attitude, continually being modified by experience. It is a function of the cognitive and affective appraisals of the discrepancies between domain specific perceptions and expectations. HRQOL was defined as an individuals cognitive and affective response to, or the QOL associated with, their health status. Health status was seen to consist of two health dimensions, physical and psychological health, with each dimension being composed of a number of component measures assessed subjectively. The developed questionnaire, the Sydney Quality of Life (SQOL) had good construct validity, based on substantial correspondence between qualitative and quantitative data, and internal consistency data (factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha). It had good concurrent validity in relation to the Sickness Impact Profile. The second order factor analysis of the SQOL suggested that health status may consist of three dimensions, physical health, positive mental health and negative mental health. The HRQOL model when formally examined, using Structural Equation Modelling (using LISREL), was not supported. However, exploratory modelling supported the separation of mental health into positive and negative components. The structure of HRQOL was different for patients than for the community from which they came. Patients QOL was determined largely by positive mental and physical health, whereas community members QOL was largely determined by negative mental health. Sixty three percent of patients at 12 months after discharge had significantly worse physical and functional health, lower satisfaction with their lives, lower positive affect and poorer QOL. Overall, mental health adapts rapidly to the impact of serious physical ill health and hospitalisation.

As marketing is usually the first corporate function to internationalise, it occupies the centre-stage in the international strategy debate.  The objective of this study is to understand the environmental and organisational factors that drive the desirable outcomes of learning, innovation and performance in multinational firms.  By adapting the IO-based, resource-based and contingency theories, the study proposes the environment-conduct-outcome framework and a model of global marketing in MNCs.  Using the structural equation modelling-based PLS methodology, the model is estimated with data from a global survey of marketing managers in MNC subsidiaries.   The results show that the traditional international marketing strategy and organisational structure constructs of adaptation and autonomy do not have a significant direct effect on MNC performance.  Instead, the effects are largely mediated by the networking, learning and innovation constructs that are included in the proposed model.  The study also shows that, whereas collaborative decision making has a positive effect on interunit learning, subsidiary autonomy has a significant influence on innovativeness in MNC subsidiaries.  Finally, it is found that marketing mix adaptation has an adverse impact on the performance of MNCs facing high global integration pressures but improves the performance of MNCs confronted with low global integration pressures.   The findings have important implications for global marketing in MNCs.  First, to enhance organisational learning and innovation and ultimately improve corporate performance, MNCs should simultaneously develop the potentially conflicting organisational attributes of collective decision-making among the subsidiaries and greater autonomy to the subsidiaries.  Second, to tap local knowledge, MNCs should increasingly regard their country units as 'colleges' or 'seminaries' of learning rather than merely as 'subsidiaries' with secondary or subordinate roles.  Finally, to improve MNC performance, the key requirement is to achieve a good fit between the global organisational structure, marketing strategy and business environment.  Overall, the results provide partial support for the IO-based and resource-based views and strong support for the contingency perspective in international strategy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global marketing</field><field name="subject">Multinational firms</field><field name="subject">Partial least squares analysis</field><field name="subject">Export marketing -- Management</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises -- Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease in Chinese and Australians</field><field name="creator">Chan, Daniel Kam Yin, School of Physiology &amp; Pharmacology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to study the environmental and genetic factors for Parkinson???s disease (PD) in Chinese and Australian. Using a case-control method, environmental factors for PD were studied in a Chinese population (n=528) in Hong Kong. Current smoking (OR=0.437; p=0.013) and infrequent tea drinking (OR=1.51; p=0.02) were found to be protective factors, whereas family history and pesticide exposure during farming in females were found to be risk factors in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, current smoking reached borderline significance at the 5% level and the variables, years exposed to pesticides and family history were significant at the 10% level. Similarly, a case-control study involving 534 subjects was conducted in Australia. A positive family history was the strongest risk factor (OR=3.4; p&amp;lt0.001). In addition, rural residency was found to be another risk factor (OR=1.8; p&amp;lt0.001). Hypertension, stroke and well water ingestion were inversely correlated with PD (OR=0.2; p&amp;lt0.001, OR=0.2; p&amp;lt0.001 and OR=0.7; p&amp;lt0.03 respectively). When genetic factors were examined in the Chinese population, no association to PD were found for the polymorphisms of the following candidate genes: CYP-2D6 debrisoquine hydroxyalse gene, dopamine transporter gene and monamine oxidase B (MAOB) gene. Furthermore, the Ala53Thr and Ala30Pro mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene were not found amongst this large Chinese population, indicating that variations of this gene are probably rare in Chinese. When candidate genes were studied amongst Caucasian Australians, the poor metaboliser genotype of CYP-2D6 was found to be weaky associated with PD (OR=1.36) in a meta-analysis. The length of the GT repeat alleles of MAOB gene were found to be significantly associated with PD (&amp;gt188 base pair and 186 base pair) while angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism was not found to be associated with PD.  A pilot study was then conducted in Randwick, New South Wales to find out the latest prevalence of PD as well as putative risk factors in a random population. A validation study was carried out for a screening tool (questionnaire) for PD, which was then used for the main study. A total of 730 subjects were involved (527 in the community and 203 in institutions). The survey found that PD prevalence was between 3.6% and 4.9% (higher in aged care facilities). The putative risk factors positively identified were ???family history???(p&amp;lt0.01) and ???exposure to chemicals at work or in surrounding environment??? (p&amp;lt0.05). The age adjusted prevalence rate of PD revealed at least 42.5 % increase in the disease compared to 1966. We conclude that there may be an increase in the disease in Australia due to aging and other risk factors.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinsons disease</field><field name="subject">Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Etiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transplantation of nasal olfactory tissues into transected spinal cord of adult rats</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jike, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transplants of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) from olfactory bulbs have recently been shown to support regrowth and reinnervation of damaged spinal cord, which has led to improved functional recovery. Using complete transection in adult rat, the studies presented in this thesis examine the role of peripherally derived olfactory tissue in promoting axonal regeneration and functional recovery. Chapter One and Two provide the background to the area of spinal cord regeneration and the methods used in this thesis. Chapter Three shows that transplants of OECs from rat olfactory lamina propria (OLP) are able to support axon regrowth in the lesioned spinal cord. The BBB score was significantly higher in experimental rats (5.4???0.84) compared with control animals (1.9???0.33) (P&amp;lt0.001). These dissociated OECs from OLP can promote axonal regrowth through the lesion. Histological assessment showed that: 1) axons labelled with Fluororuby grew into the injury site in OECs-transplanted rats, with occasional fibres extending into the rostral cord; 2) brainstem neurons in the raphe nucleus were retrogradely labeled with Fluororuby; and 3) serotonergic axons were detectable distal to the lesion in OECs-transplanted rats. No fibres grew into the injured region and no retrograde labeling or serotonergic fibres were seen in control animals. The role of regenerated serotonergic fibres in OECs-transplanted rats is discussed. Chapter Four demonstrates that solid pieces of OLP dissected from the nose can re-establish the continuity of the transected cord and supply the OECs that can migrate to the cord stumps to support the axon regeneration. Experimental rats which received OLP from olfactory mucosa showed significantly greater locomotive recovery (BBB scores: OLP, 5.0???1.9; control, 1.5???0.5, p&amp;lt0.0001). In animals with OLP transplants, histological analysis indicated that nerve fibres, expressing neurofilament and serotonin were present at the transection site. Locomotive recovery of the hindlimbs occurred,  similar to that seen after OECs transplantation. Retrograde labeling of medullary raphe neurons and gigantocellular reticular nucleus occurred following Fluororuby injection in the cord distal to the lesion, further supporting the supraspinal origin of the 5-HT innervation in the present studies. These results indicate that OLP is effective in promoting partial spinal cord repair. Chapter Five examines functional recovery of spinal reflex circuitry, ie., H-reflex excitability using paired stimuli, in OLP-transplanted rats compared with normal and respiratory lamina propria (RLP) transplanted animals. H-reflex amplitude of the conditioned response was significantly reduced in OLP transplanted rats compared to RLP transplanted animals (p&amp;lt 0.05). Therefore, hindlimb reflex excitability can be modulated by OLP transplants after transection of the spinal cord in adult rats. Chapter Six examines whether functional recovery can occur if transplantation of OLP tissue is delayed by 1 month after the spinal cord transection. The BBB score was significantly higher in experimental rats (4.3???0.8 for OLP) compared with control animals (1.0???0.3, P&amp;lt 0.001), but recovery was less than after acute transplantation. Asx before, histological assessment of OLP animals showed: a) serotonergic axons were present in the cord below the transection site; b) brainstem raphe nuclei was retrogradely labeled; c) bisbenzimide pre-labeled cells from OLP transplants migrated in host spinal cord. These changes were not seen in control animals. These results indicate that OLP has the ability to promote axonal regeneration in chronically injured cord of adult rats. Chapter Seven compares the results from these three types of intervention. In conclusion, these studies show that peripherally derived OECs or solid pieces of OLP can promote partial spinal cord repair in acute or chronic transection injuries.

At the beginning of the third millennium, this ???will??? is described as neocorporatism, an ideology based on corporate structure and third sector co-governance.  The research highlights the interrelationships between professions and ideology.  A case study of the Canadian Institute of Planners - CIP - demonstrates how this neocorporatist philosophy is having an impact on its power and legitimacy and, ultimately, its effect within Canadian society.  An historical review demonstrates how the Canadian Institute of Planners has reacted to and reflected state ideology throughout its history.  It is clear that the organisation has been in a submissive relationship with the state until recently, where we see the balance of power starting to shift.  The CIP is currently reorganising itself to better integrate with the state and improve its government relations.  Documentation tracks the CIP???s participation in national policy processes and shows that it is, in fact, becoming significantly more involved in policy-making through various federal government consultation and partnership initiatives.  The Canadian Institute of Planners seems to rely solely on practical conjecture to inform its operational choices.  My hermeneutical discourse analysis uses existing theory and empirical information to advance our understanding of the CIP and by implication, professions in general.  This enlightenment can help direct the organisation???s strategy within the neocorporate state apparatus and, ultimately, enable it to gain power, legitimacy and greater influence within Canada???s policy- and decision-making spheres.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">professions</field><field name="subject">Canadian Institute of Planners</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">neocorporatism</field><field name="subject">urban policy</field><field name="subject">city planning</field><field name="subject">city planners</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of a Static Concentrating Photovoltaic Roof Tile</field><field name="creator">Dickinson, Michael, Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this document is to investigate through industrial design the potential of a high efficiency photovoltaic concentrator theory. The investigation directs a proposed layout for the design of a device, which specifically addresses the incorporation of the concentrator theory into the design of a photovoltaic ????????roof tile????????. The focus of the investigation has been the integration of theoretical constructs and physical realities. The objective is to facilitate this transition from theory to reality: to contribute to the quest of creating viable manufacturable designs for the generation of clean low cost electrical power. The use of a roof tile as the focus of the incorporating device served two purposes. Number one: it provided a sensible, existing platform, which is under utilised, presented potential and fitted within established building practices. It was not the objective of this thesis to argue that tile integration is the best, only or even the most financially viable direction to pursue; it was one option among many. This brings us to the second purpose; the consideration of existing roofing tiles forced the theory to be applied within set limitations, in particular existing size restrictions. The imposition of a framework to work within highlighted the design issues, which would have to be addressed in the actualisation of the theory. The theory????????s broad strategy for economic viability has been to reduce the actual silicone cell content of panel designs by approximately one third. This is achieved by the use of numerically fewer cells in combination with a concentration method, which does not cost more than the savings gained by the use of fewer cells. This document records the design process undertaken and presents the findings so that further development can be undertaken.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic</field><field name="subject">static concentrating</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18229</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Association of Libarians in colleges of advanced education and the committee of Australian university librarians: The evolution of two higher education library groups, 1958-1997</field><field name="creator">Oakshott, Stephen Craig, School of Information, Library &amp; Archives Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the history of Commonwealth Government higher education policy in Australia between 1958 and 1997 and its impact on the development of two groups of academic librarians: the Association of Librarians in Colleges in Advanced Education (ALCAE) and the Committee of Australian University Librarians (CAUL). Although university librarians had met occasionally since the late 1920s, it was only in 1965 that a more formal organisation, known as CAUL, was established to facilitate the exchange of ideas and information. ALCAE was set up in 1969 and played an important role helping develop a special concept of library service peculiar to the newly formed College of Advanced Education (CAE) sector. As well as examining the impact of Commonwealth Government higher education policy on ALCAE and CAUL, the thesis also explores the influence of other factors on these two groups, including the range of personalities that comprised them, and their relationship with their parent institutions and with other professional groups and organisations. The study focuses on how higher education policy and these other external and internal factors shaped the functions, aspirations, and internal dynamics of these two groups and how this resulted in each group evolving differently.  The author argues that, because of the greater attention given to the special educational role of libraries in the CAE curriculum, the group of college librarians had the opportunity to participate in, and have some influence on, Commonwealth Government statutory bodies responsible for the coordination of policy and the distribution of funding for the CAE sector. The link between ALCAE and formal policy-making processes resulted in a more dynamic group than CAUL, with the university librarians being discouraged by their Vice-Chancellors from having contact with university funding bodies because of the desire of the universities to maintain a greater level of control over their affairs and resist interference from government. The circumstances of each group underwent a reversal over time as ALCAE's effectiveness began to diminish as a result of changes to the CAE sector and as member interest was transferred to other groups and organisations. Conversely, CAUL gradually became a more active group during the 1980s and early 1990s as a result of changes to higher education, the efforts of some university librarians, and changes in membership. This study is based principally on primary source material, with the story of ALCAE and CAUL being told through the use of a combination of original documentation (including minutes of meetings and correspondence) and interviews with members of each group and other key figures.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Association of Librarians in Colleges of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">Committee of Australian University Librarians</field><field name="subject">CAUL</field><field name="subject">ALCAE</field><field name="subject">Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Libraries</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">Universities</field><field name="subject">Colleges of Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">CAE</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Cooperation</field><field name="subject">Interest Groups</field><field name="subject">Lobbying</field><field name="subject">Lobby Groups</field><field name="subject">Federal Government</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Government</field><field name="subject">Funding</field><field name="subject">Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee</field><field name="subject">AVCC</field><field name="subject">Australian Advisory Council on Bibliographical Services</field><field name="subject">AACOBS</field><field name="subject">Library Association of Australia</field><field name="subject">LAA</field><field name="subject">Australian Library and Information Association</field><field name="subject">ALIA</field><field name="subject">CAVAL</field><field name="subject">Co-operative Action by Victorian Academic Libraries</field><field name="subject">CLANN</field><field name="subject">College Libraries Activities Network New South Wales</field><field name="subject">ACDP</field><field name="subject">Australian Committee of Directors and Principals</field><field name="subject">Australian Bibliographical Network</field><field name="subject">ABN</field><field name="subject">Australian Libraries and Information Council</field><field name="subject">ALIC</field><field name="subject">Australian Commission on Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">ACAE</field><field name="subject">Australian Universities Commission</field><field name="subject">AUC</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">CACAE</field><field name="subject">Australian Commission on Advanced Education</field><field name="subject">ACAE</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission</field><field name="subject">CTEC</field><field name="subject">Tertiary Education Commission</field><field name="subject">TEC</field><field name="subject">Department of Employment Education and Training</field><field name="subject">DEET</field><field name="subject">New South Wales Advanced Education Conference</field><field name="subject">NSWAEC</field><field name="subject">UNISON</field><field name="subject">Victor CRITTENDEN</field><field name="subject">Paul McNALLY</field><field name="subject">Andrew OSBORN</field><field name="subject">Dorothy PEAKE</field><field name="subject">Jack WARD</field><field name="subject">Dietrich BORCHARDT</field><field name="subject">Harrison BRYAN</field><field name="subject">Ted FLOWERS</field><field name="subject">Allan HORTON</field><field name="subject">Neil RADFORD</field><field name="subject">Denis RICHARDSON</field><field name="subject">Colin STEELE</field><field name="subject">Eric WAINWRIGHT</field><field name="subject">Frank HAMBLY</field><field name="subject">Geoff ALLEN</field><field name="subject">Christopher AWCOCK</field><field name="subject">Judith EDWARDS</field><field name="subject">John CUMMINGS</field><field name="subject">Katherine CUMMINGS</field><field name="subject">Axel LODEWYCKS</field><field name="subject">Derek FIELDING</field><field name="subject">Leonard JOLLEY</field><field name="subject">Brian SOUTHWELL</field><field name="subject">John SHIPP</field><field name="subject">James O'BRIEN</field><field name="subject">Jessie HARLEY</field><field name="subject">Bill HITCHINS</field><field name="subject">Lois JENNINGS</field><field name="subject">John YOCKLUNN</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18238</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) (Macropodidae: Marsupialia) in the Northern Jarrah Forest of Australia</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Matt, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The quokka (Setonix brachyurus Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1830) is a medium-sized, macropodid marsupial that is endemic to the mesic, south-western corner of Australia.  While being a tourist icon on Rottnest Island, the species is threatened with extinction.  It has been intensively studied on Rottnest Island in the 1960s and 1970s, however very little is known of its ecology on the mainland.  Additionally the insular and mainland environments are extremely different suggesting that ecological differences between the two populations are likely.  Consequently, this study sought to determine the basic autecology of the quokka and identify what factors have attributed to its threatened conservation status.  The northern jarrah forest of Western Australia was selected as the study region due to it being at the northern limit of extant quokka distribution and because it was thought that the factors threatening the quokka would be exacerbated there. Fossil deposits suggest that the quokka originally occupied an area of approximately 49,000 km2 in the south-western corner of Australia.  Historical literature show that they were widespread and abundant when Europeans colonised the region in 1829 but a noticeable and dramatic decline occurred a century later.  The arrival of the red fox to the region coincided almost exactly with this decline and so it was probably ultimately responsible.  Continued predation by both it and the feral cat are likely to have continued the decline, along with habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes.  Specific surveys and literature searches show that since the 1950s, the area occupied by the quokka has declined by 45% and since 1990 by 29%.  Based on the criteria of the IUCN (Hilton-Taylor 2000), the conservation status of the quokka should remain as vulnerable.  An endangered status may be more applicable if the quokkas restriction to patches through its existence as a metapopulation is considered. Trapping of eight sites supporting quokka populations in the mid-1990s revealed three sites now locally extinct despite the ongoing, six year old, fox control programme.  Another three are at serious risk of extinction.  Extant population sizes ranged from one to 36 and population density ranged from 0.07 to 4.3 individuals per hectare.  This is considered to be below the carrying capacity of each site. The overall quokka population size in the northern jarrah forest may be as low as 150 adult individuals, of which half are likely to be female.  Even the largest extant populations are highly susceptible to stochastic extinction events.  This small size was surprising considering the six year old, introduced predator control programme. Historically, the restriction to discrete habitat patches, the occasional inter-patch movement, the lack of correlation between the dynamics of each population and reports of frequent localised extinctions and colonisations suggest that the quokka population once existed as part of a classic metapopulation.  The massive decline of the quokka in the 1930s pushed the metapopulation structure into a non-equilibrium state such that today, the extant populations are the terminal remnants of the original classic metapopulation. Wild mainland quokkas breed throughout the year.  A significant reduction in the number of births occurs over summer and this coincides with a decline in female body weight.  Despite this, the mainland quokka is relatively fecund and is able to wean two offspring per year.  The level of recruitment from pouch young to independence was low and this may explain the apparent lack of population increase following the initiation of fox control.  A total of 56 trapped quokkas were fitted with a radio collar.  Mean home range size for quokkas was 6.39 ha with a core range of 1.21 ha and this was negatively related to population density.  Male home ranges were larger than females but not significantly when the sexual size dimorphism was considered.  Nocturnal ranges were larger than diurnal ranges reflecting nocturnal departures from the swamp refugia.  Home range sizes varied seasonally, probably due to changes in the distance required to move to obtain sufficient nutrients and water over the dry summer compared to the wet winter and spring.  Telemetry confirmed trapping results that showed no movement between swamps or populations.  Home range centres shifted to the periphery of the swamp following the winter inundation and this may increase the species susceptibility to predation.  The lack of dispersal is probably caused by quokka populations existing below carrying capacity and following selection for philopatry under the threat of predation for dispersing individuals.  Without dispersal to recolonise or rescue unpopulated patches, the collapse of the original quokka metapopulation appears to have occurred.  On a macrohabitat scale, the quokka in the northern jarrah forest is restricted to Agonis swamp shrubland habitats that form in the open, upper reaches of creek systems on the western side of the forest.  This restriction was probably initially due to the high water requirements of the quokka but is likely to have been exacerbated by increased predation pressure since the arrival of the fox.  On a microhabitat scale, the quokka is a habitat specialist, preferring early seral stage swamp habitats, probably for foraging, as part of a mosaic of old age swamp that provides refuge. Despite the six year old, introduced predator control programme, foxes and cats are still the major cause of mortality to quokkas.  Road kills was the other identifiable cause.  Individuals alive at the start of the study had an 81% chance of staying alive until the end.  The likelihood of dying was minimised by grouping together with conspecifics, maximising home range size and maximising the time spent within the swampy refuge.  Current rates of adult and juvenile survivorship should allow population recovery and so it seems pouch young mortality, reflected by low recruitment, has inhibited the anticipated population increase following predator control. The confounding effect of inadequate unbaited controls meant that little statistical evidence was available on the impact of introduced predators on the quokka, however the models provided support for earlier hypotheses of these.  The presence of a quokka population at a site was related to the amount of poison baits delivered ??? reflecting predation pressure, the average age of the swamp and a mosaic of early and late seral stages within the swamp habitat.  Recently burnt habitat is thought to provide food for quokkas and long unburnt habitat provides refuge from predation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Northern Jarrah Forest Reserve</field><field name="subject">quokka</field><field name="subject">Setonix brachyurus</field><field name="subject">Macropodidae</field><field name="subject">Marsupialia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometry: development and characterization of a new instrument</field><field name="creator">Selby, David  Sean, School of Chemical Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The performance of a linear matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer (MALDI-oa-TOFMS) was improved with more reproducible sample preparation methods, a higher rate digitiser for integrating signals and customisable computer control, data acquisition and analysis in the LabVIEW?programming environment. This resulted in a ~20% improvement in resolution (up to 4,400) and enabled measurement of desorption velocities of 1,000 - 1,800 ms-1 for analytes with m/z 615 ?1,350 Da, with matrix ion velocities being 4,000 ?4,800 ms?. Detector limitations and restrictions on source axis energy (and hence velocity) required for the analysis of ions prevented detection of other species with this instrument. A 20 kV reflecting geometry MALDI-oa-TOFMS was constructed to overcome these limitations and extend the mass range. This mass spectrometer was able to analyse ions desorbed with a wide range of energies (32 ?197 eV). The resolution was found to be 8,000 -10,000. Best mass accuracy was 15-80 ppm (internal standards ). External calibration gave larger mass errors, mostly due to timing jitter, but the mass axis was stable for &amp;lt2 weeks. Mass accuracy was independent of the analyte and matrix used. Ions with m/z of ~10,000 - 20,000 Da were observable with the use of a pulsed lens in the target region. This lens increased signal approximately 20 times, but degraded resolution. The detection limit of the instrument (sample consumed) was estimated to vary from 10 ?90 fmol, by extrapolation, with more moles required at higher m/z. The microsphere plate (MSP) electron multiplier used in the reflecting instrument was found to have a temporal response of &amp;gt1 ns FWHM, but with a low secondary electron conversion efficiency, making it unsuitable for high m/z species. Experiments were also performed with a novel rectangular mesh grid, which (in correct orientation) provided similar resolution to conventional square mesh grids, but with significantly improved transmission and hence sensitivity.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time-of-flight mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">mass</field><field name="subject">spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barriers to the systematic provision of smoking cessation education during pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Cooke, Margaret, Community Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research literature suggests that clinicians fail to adequately use health education interventions that have been demonstrated to be effective.  This thesis examines the use of smoking cessation education (SCE) by clinicians who care for pregnant women.  It investigates the clinician, organisational and dissemination variables which impact on the provision of smoking cessation education in antenatal clinics.  Individual behaviour change theory, organisational theory and diffusion theory are used to guide the design and analysis of the research.  A series of cross-sectional studies are used to investigate the provision of SCE and the outcomes of dissemination of a tested SCE program.  Data are collected from multiple sources and both qualitative and quantitative research methods are used.  Studies 1 and 2 indicated there was a performance gap between the reported SCE practice of clinicians who provide care for pregnant women and the recommended guidelines for SCE practice.  The primary modifiable barriers to the provision of SCE by clinicians were: low clinician self-efficacy with regard to SCE; inadequate smoking assessment; lack of hospital SCE policy; and inadequate training.  To overcome these barriers a SCE program was disseminated to 23 hospital antenatal clinics in NSW.  Prior to dissemination, the organisational context of the clinics was explored using qualitative methods to determine the potential barriers to dissemination and to recommend strategies to overcome these barriers (Study 3).  The remaining Studies (4-6) describe the outcomes of program dissemination using two methods of dissemination (intensive and simple).  Clinics were randomly allocated to the two dissemination methods.  Studies 4 and 5 describe program adoption by clinic managers three months after the initial dissemination.  Study 6 investigates the implementation and maintenance of the program by clinicians 18 months after dissemination.  The final study also examines the effect of two methods of dissemination on the provision of SCE in antenatal clinics.  Most managers adopted or partially adopted the new SCE program.  The fidelity of program adoption was better when intensive dissemination methods were used and when managers had more positive perceptions of the program.  Dissemination method did not affect the number of SCE interventions offered by clinics, but clinicians in the intensive dissemination group were more likely to use more intensive and effective forms of SCE intervention.  Nevertheless, the program was poorly implemented and SCE was not systematically provided in clinics after dissemination.  The organisational, individual and dissemination barriers to health education are described.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smoking cessation</field><field name="subject">pregnancy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shear strength of rock masses</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Kurt John, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The first section of this thesis (Chapter 2) describes the creation and analysis of a database on concrete and masonry dam incidents known as CONGDATA. The aim was to carry out as complete a study of concrete and masonry dam incidents as was practicable, with a greater emphasis than in other studies on the geology, mode of failure, and the warning signs that were observed. This analysis was used to develop a method of very approximately assessing probabilities of failure. This can be used in initial risk assessments of large concrete and masonry dams along with analysis of stability for various annual exceedance probability floods. The second and main section of this thesis (Chapters 3-6) had its origins in the results of Chapter 2 and the general interests of the author. It was found that failure through the foundation was common in the list of dams analysed and that information on how to assess the strength of the foundations of dams on rock masses was limited. This section applies to all applications of rock mass strength such as the stability of rock slopes. Methods used for assessing the shear strength of jointed rock masses are based on empirical criteria. As a general rule such criteria are based on laboratory scale specimens with very little, and often no, field validation. The Hoek-Brown empirical rock mass failure criterion was developed in 1980 for hard rock masses. Since its development it has become virtually universally accepted and is now used for all types of rock masses and in all stress regimes. This thesis uses case studies and databases of intact rock and rockfill triaxial tests collated by the author to review the current Hoek-Brown criterion. The results highlight the inability of the criterion to fit all types of intact rock and poor quality rock masses. This arose predominately due to the exponent a being restrained to approximately 0.5 to 0.62 and using rock type as a predictor of mi. Modifications to the equations for determining the Hoek-Brown parameters are provided that overcome these problems. In the course of reviewing the Hoek-Brown criterion new equations were derived for estimating the shear strength of intact rock and rockfill. Empirical slope design curves have also been developed for use as a preliminary tool for slope design.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Returning Medusa's gaze : Baroque intertext in Alejo Carpentier</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Steve, School of Modern Languages, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the concept of the baroque as applied to the works of the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier (1904-1980). It revisits the original inspiration that the writer found in baroque architecture and sculpture, as expressed in the articles he wrote from Spain in the early 1930s, and follows his use of baroque culture in each of his novels. It is found that, through his attempt to create a period ambience for his historical fictions by incorporating into his novels descriptions of the art and architecture of the Baroque era, and by imitating the literary style of Spanish Golden Age writers, he ultimately produced a parodic and ironic style that was put to a highly original use even in those works set in the contemporary period. Finally, the mature works produced in the last decade of Carpentier's life are studied, and the continuities and discontinuities between these works and those of previous periods are examined, in order to arrive at a critical assessment of the potential to renovate the Latin American novel created by this writer's use of the baroque. Throughout this thesis the primary focus is placed upon the role played by the visual arts, including architecture, in Carpentier's development of baroque themes and style, a secondary focus being placed upon literary influences. Thus the importance for Carpentier of various writers and artists is examined, such as Cervantes, Quevedo, Piranesi, Vico, Goya, Barr????s and d'Ors. It is found that Carpentier's use of baroque themes, motifs and style enabled him to make a unique contribution to literature in a number of ways: by creating an original means of representing the position of the individual with regard to society and the historical process, by reevaluating Latin American culture and environment vis-????-vis is Europe, and by adopting a postcolonial perspective of cultural self-assertiveness that was to pave the way for the 'boom' in the Latin American novel.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carpentier</field><field name="subject">Alejo</field><field name="subject">1904-</field><field name="subject">Carpentier</field><field name="subject">Alejo</field><field name="subject">Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The surgical management of patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Anthony James, St. Vincent's Hospital, UNSW</field><field name="description">Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major cause of morbidity and death globally, and the number of individuals infected with this virus is increasing in many nations.  Advanced HIV infection causes immunocompromise that predisposes to opportunistic infections and malignancies that characterise the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  Although the management of many of these AIDS-associated infections and malignancies is by medical means, surgeons play an important role the diagnosis and management of many of these conditions.  Furthermore, patients with HIV infection may present with surgical disorders or traumatic injuries that are not related to HIV or AIDS.  Health care workers managing patients with HIV infection and AIDS, particularly those involved in performing invasive procedures, are at risk of exposure to this virus in infected blood and body fluids.  St. Vincent's hospital, Sydney, is a teaching hospital and major treatment centre for patients with HIV infection and AIDS located in the inner-eastern suburbs of Sydney.  Patients with HIV infection who underwent surgical procedures at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1990 to 1999 were retrospectively reviewed in order to describe the nature of the operative procedures required in the management of these patients.  There were 636 patients with documented infection with HIV who underwent 889 surgical procedures at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1990 to 1999.  The number of procedures performed for patients with known HIV infection was increasing during this period.  Patients with HIV infection accounted for 1.1% of all surgical procedures performed at this institution during this period.  The proportion of total operative cases that patients with known HIV infection represented was seen to be increasing during this period.  Surgical procedures were performed during only a small proportion of admissions of patients with HIV infection to St. Vincent's hospital for this period (2.4% of these admissions).  The patients were predominantly males in younger age groups.  Anorectal procedures for the local treatment of benign conditions were the most common procedures performed for these patients, followed by procedures for the insertion or removal of long-term vascular access devices and other minor general surgical procedures.  A large proportion of procedures were performed as day surgery cases (30%).  Only a small proportion of cases were for the management of traumatic conditions (3%).  A large proportion of patients with HIV infection (26%) underwent more than one procedure during this period, with anorectal disorders a common cause of repeat surgical admission.  The operative findings after 498 surgical procedures performed for 360 patients with documented HIV infection during the period 1995 to 1999 were retrospectively reviewed.  The number of cases in which AIDS-defining conditions were encountered were recorded, and varied according to the types of procedures performed.  Overall, seventy AIDS-defining conditions were found at operation during sixty-five procedures (13% of all procedures for patients with HIV infection).  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most frequently encountered AIDS-defining disorder found at operation, accounting for 41% of such conditions.  Kaposi's sarcoma was the next most frequently encountered condition, accounting for 20% of cases followed by cytomegalovirus infection (11%).  Procedures in which AIDS-defining conditions were commonly encountered included neurosurgical procedures (20 of 36 procedures were for AIDS-defining conditions), particularly stereotactic brain biopsy.  Lymph node excision biopsies had AIDS-defining pathologies seen in 18 of 26 cases, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  AIDS-defining conditions were diagnosed in only 4% of anorectal procedures, with anal squamous cell malignant lesions a far more frequently observed disorder (diagnosed in 11% of cases).  The clinical details of all patients who met the clinical criteria for AIDS who underwent midline laparotomy at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1987 to 1998 were retrospectively examined.  Thirty patients with AIDS underwent thirty laparotomies during this period.  AIDS-defining conditions were found at fourteen procedures (47%).  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found in eleven of these laparotomies, Kaposi's sarcoma in two and cytomegalovirus in one.  In nine of the patients with AIDS-defining conditions, the post-operative diagnosis was different to that expected pre-operatively.  Patients with AIDS-defining conditions found at laparotomy had significantly lower serum albumin concentrations and body weight compared with those with more conventional surgical diagnoses.  There was no difference in CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, the number of patients with a history of AIDS-defining conditions or the duration of HIV infection between these two groups.  Patients with AIDS-defining conditions diagnosed at laparotomy required significantly longer post-operative hospital stays compared to those with other causes, although there was no difference in the incidence of post-operative complications or deaths occurring in these two groups.  There was a high number of patients with post-operative complications seen after laparotomy (thirty-two complications in twenty-one patients; 70% of all patients).  Chest infections, systemic sepsis and wound infections were the most frequently encountered post-operative complications.  Five deaths occurred within thirty days of operation (17% of patients), and were due to overwhelming systemic sepsis in four cases and from blood loss and coagulopathy in one.  The number and the nature of the complications and deaths occurring in patients with AIDS undergoing laparotomy at St. Vincent's hospital is in keeping with previously published reports from other centres.  The clinical details of patients with documented HIV infection who underwent biliary tract procedures at St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1989 to 1998 were retrospectively reviewed.  Eighteen patients with HIV (fourteen of which met the clinical criteria for AIDS) underwent cholecystectomy; ten for cholecystitis secondary to gallstones, one for mucocoele of the gallbladder due to obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone and seven for acalculous cholecystitis.  Biliary tract procedures accounted for 24% of all abdominal procedures during this period.  Patients were mostly male and in a relatively young age range.  Cytomegalovirus infection was found in five cases of acalculous cholecystitis, Cryptosporidia in five and Microsporidia in two.  A significantly greater proportion of patients with acalculous cholecystitis had a history of AIDS, and these patients had lower CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, compared with those patients with cholelithiasis.  There was no statistical difference in the length of hospital admission or number of complications occurring in these two groups.  Patients who had cholecystectomy performed as an elective procedure (n=7) were compared with those who had this procedure performed during admission for acute cholecystitis (n=11), and had a significantly lower duration of post-operative hospital stay.  There was no difference in the number of complications occurring in these two groups.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in eight patients, and was not associated with a significant difference in hospital admission duration or incidence of complications when compared with the ten patients who underwent open cholecystectomy.  The medical records of all patients presenting to St. Vincent's hospital during the period 1994 to 1998 with major penetrating wounds (gunshot wounds and stab wounds to the trunk or neck) were retrospectively examined to determine the number of such patients with a documented history of infection with HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV), or with risk factors for these infections.  Of the 148 patients with major penetrating wounds who were managed at St. Vincent??s hospital during this period, 5.4% had documented infection HCV and 1.3% with HIV.  Risk factors were documented in thirty-one individuals (21%), with injecting drug use the most commonly recorded (19%).  Individuals infected with HIV represent a substantial workload for surgical specialists at St. Vincent's hospital.  Surgical procedures were an uncommon cause of admission for patients with HIV infection, but were important in the diagnosis and management of many AIDS-associated conditions and were increasing in number.  AIDS-defining conditions accounted for only a small proportion of operative interventions in patients with HIV infection.  Surgical procedures required in the management of patients with HIV infection encompassed a broad range of surgical specialties and types of procedures.  AIDS-associated opportunistic infections and malignancy were frequently the cause of abdominal procedures in patients with HIV and AIDS.  The number of patients with known HIV infection who present for elective and emergency surgical procedures, as well as the high prevalence of documented HIV and HCV in patients with major penetrating wounds at St. Vincent's hospital, reinforces the need for all health care workers to practice strict universal precautions against body fluid exposure at all times.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surgery</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) -- Patients</field><field name="subject">HIV-positive persons</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering and acute physiological testing of a retinal neurostimulator</field><field name="creator">Suaning, Gregg J????rgen, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electrical stimulation of retinal neurons is known to elicit visual sensations. When applied to the retina in a spatial pattern, electrical stimulation may be capable of providing rudimentary patterned vision that may be of benefit to sufferers of degenerative retinal disorders. No such device has yet been devised to provide for chronic study of the psychophysical perceptions elicited from a prosthesis for retinal stimulation. In this study, steps towards achieving this goal have been successfully carried out. Foregoing research was reviewed such that appropriate stimulation parameters were incorporated in the design of a 100 stimulation channel, complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit, small enough in size so as to be capable of being implanted within the ocular anatomy or surrounding orbit. The device, and its associated external hardware and software were designed, modeled, fabricated, and interfaced with stimulating electrodes in acute testing in a highorder mammal (Ovis aries) so as to assess the capabilities of the device to elicit cortical potentials as a direct result of stimulation of the neural retina. Testing was performed under conditions similar to those anticipated in chronic in-situ configurations wherein radio-frequency telemetry was used to deliver power and configuration parameters to the device thus avoiding the passage of wires through tissue in order to communicate to the implant circuit. The results of the testing indicate that the circuit is indeed capable of eliciting physiological responses in the animal and evidence is present that these responses could be elicited in patterned form. Further work undertaken includes the development of surgical methods for implantation, and application of the prosthesis circuit in functional electronic stimulation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retina -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Electric stimulation</field><field name="subject">Vision -- Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simple star multihop optical network</field><field name="creator">Chonbodeechalermroong, Yongyut, School of Electrical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A new multihop wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical network designed for uniform traffic with two wavelengths per node that can give the maximum throughput and minimum delay is proposed. It is called a 'Simple Star' multihop optical network. This network has good characteristics in traffic balance and small average number of hops. Moreover, Simple Star can be used together with multiple star couplers to reduce the number of wavelength used. Furthermore, unlike most existing networks, this network does not impose an upper limit to the number of nodes. Another interesting pattern is Simple Star with Center Node (Simple Star CN) particularly for prime numbers of nodes. It can be shown that the average number of hops of Simple Star (normal plus CN) is in between those of Shufflenet and Kautz, but the throughput and delay are better. An associated network called Simple Star Shared Channel (Simple Star SC) for two transceivers per node is also presented and it can be used together with multiple star couplers to reduce the number of wavelengths. An example of a 16-node Simple Star SC shows that the number of wavelengths used can be 8 times less than that in the normal Simple Star network.

The formation of an alliance between Aboriginal owners and greens to protest against the mine resulted in a lengthy campaign that included maintaining a camp near the leasesite and organising a long series of mass protest actions in a remote location over an extended period from March to October 1998. However, some tensions between greens and the traditional Aboriginal owners became evident as the campaign went on. This thesis traces the origins of these tensions to past conflicts between environmentalists and Aboriginal people and shows that they are largely related to their conflicting perceptions of the environment. Those perceptions arise from different knowledge systems and are encapsulated in the terms 'wilderness' and 'country', used to describe the physical world by environmentalists and Aboriginal owners respectively. I discuss the attitudes towards the environment that accompany those perceptions and consider the way they were manifest in some of the tensions that arose at Jabiluka. The close relationship between influential strands of environmentalism and Western science is a related source of conflict. My analysis of that relationship shows that environmentalism, via 'green science' is more closely aligned with the developmentalist worldview than the Aboriginal worldview. The thesis is an analytical reflection upon the Jabiluka Protesters' Camp based on the personal experience I gained from my fieldwork there and informed by the literature of feminism, ecofeminism, social constructionism and anthropology. I discuss the manifestations of ecofeminism I observed at Jabiluka. I argue that the Jabiluka Protesters' Camp functioned successfully because it utilised ecofeminist principles and practices, that as a consequence the relationship between greens and blacks has been strengthened and therefore that ecofeminism can continue to have a positive effect on those relations in the future.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecofeminism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Women in conservation of natural resources</field><field name="subject">Uranium mines and mining</field><field name="subject">Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Jabiluka (N.T.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching styles and student behaviour in instrumental music lessons in Australian conservatoriums</field><field name="creator">Zhukov, Katie, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This investigation into instrumental music teaching at the tertiary (conservatorium) level sought to observe and describe typical teacher and student behaviour in this under-researched educational setting. The aim of the study was to examine a wide range of areas associated with instrumental music teaching in order to identify patterns of behaviour exhibited by teachers and students and to define teaching and learning styles present in advanced applied music teaching. After a review of literature on teaching in general and on music teaching in particular, an observational instrument for individual instrumental music lessons was developed and refined in pilot studies. 12 prominent Australian teachers were videotaped teaching 24 students, with the sample being balanced geographically, institutionally, by instrument (three mainstream groups: piano, strings and winds) and by gender (equal numbers of male and female teachers and students). Steps were taken to observe realistic teaching of typical students and to minimise the observer???s intrusion into the lesson dynamics. The videotaped lessons were analysed using an observational instrument and the data was subjected to various statistical analyses. Results are reported according to five main areas (lesson structure, lesson content, teaching methodology, teacher/ student relationship, and teaching and learning styles) and discussed with reference to existing literature. The conclusions of this study enhance current understanding of studio music teaching, by supporting many of the findings of previous research and substantiating their application to advanced instrumental music teaching. This study provides new insights into the underlying structure of instrumental music lessons, the primacy of technique in terms of lesson content, the use of teaching strategies such as demonstration, evaluation and questioning, gender differences between teachers and between students, and the types of teaching and learning styles that are prevalent in conservatorium settings.

Synthetic loading causes the induction machine to draw full-load current without the need to connect a mechanical load to the machine's drive shaft. The synthetic loading methods cause the machine to periodically accelerate and decelerate, producing an alternating motor-generator action. This action causes the machine, on average over each synthetic loading cycle, to operate at rated rms current, rated rms voltage and full-load speed, thereby producing rated copper losses, iron loss and friction and windage loss. The excitation voltages are supplied from a PWM inverter with a large capacity DC bus capable of supplying rated rms voltage.  The synthetic loading methods of efficiency evaluation are verified in terms of the individual losses in the machine by using a new dynamic model that accounts for iron loss and all parameter variations. The losses are compared with the steady-state loss distribution determined using very accurate induction machine parameters. The parameters were identified using a run-up-to-speed test at rated voltage and the locked rotor and synchronous speed tests conducted with a variable voltage supply. The latter tests were used to synthesise the variations in stator leakage reactance, magnetising reactance and the equivalent iron loss resistance over the induction machine's speed range. The run-up-to-speed test was used to determine the rotor resistance and leakage reactance variations over the same speed range. The test method results showed for the first time that the rotor leakage reactance varied in the same manner as the stator leakage and magnetising reactances with respect to current. When all parameter variations are taken into account there is good agreement between theoretical and measured results for the synthetic loading methods. The synthetic loading methods are applied to three-phase induction machines with both single- and double-cage rotors to assess the effect of rotor parameter variations in the method. Various excitation waveforms for each method were used and the measured and modelled efficiencies compared to conventional efficiency test results. The results verify that it is possible to accurately evaluate the efficiency of three-phase induction machines using synthetic loading.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">synthetic loading</field><field name="subject">induction motor</field><field name="subject">parameter identification</field><field name="subject">parameter</field><field name="subject">efficiency testing</field><field name="subject">efficiency</field><field name="subject">dual frequency</field><field name="subject">sweep frequency</field><field name="subject">constant speed of rotating magnetic field</field><field name="subject">three phase induction motor</field><field name="subject">three phase induction machine</field><field name="subject">variable rotor parameter</field><field name="subject">electric machinery</field><field name="subject">induction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hospital performance including quality: creating economic incentives consistent with evidence-based medicine</field><field name="creator">Eckermann, Simon, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses questions of how to incorporate quality of care, represented by disutility-bearing effects such as mortality, morbidity and re-admission, in measuring relative performance of public hospitals. Currently, case-mix funding and performance, measured with costs per case-mix adjusted separation, hold hospitals accountable for costs, but not effects, of care, creating economic incentives for quality of care minimising cost per admission.  To allow an appropriate trade-off between the value and cost of quality of care a correspondence is demonstrated between maximising net benefit and minimising costs plus decision makers??? value of disutility events, where effects of care can be represented by disutility events and hospitals face a common comparator. Applying this correspondence to performance measurement, frontier methods specifying disutility events as inputs are illustrated to have distinct advantages over output specifications, allowing estimation of: 1. economic efficiency conditional on the value of avoiding disutility events. 2. technical, scale and congestion sources of net benefit efficiency; 3. best practice peers over potential decision makers??? value of quality; and 4. industry shadow price of avoiding disutility events.  The accountability this performance measurement framework provides for effects and cost of quality of care are also illustrated as the basis for moving from case-mix funding towards a funding mechanism based on maximising net benefit. Links to evidence-based medicine in health technology assessment are emphasised in illustrating application of the correspondence to comparison of multiple strategies in the cost-disutility plane, where radial properties as shown to provide distinct advantages over comparison in the cost-effectiveness plane.  The identified performance measurement and funding framework allows policy makers to create economic incentives consistent with evidence-based medicine in practice, while avoiding incentives for cream-skimming and cost-shifting. The linear nature of the net benefit correspondence theorem allows simple inclusion of multiple effects of quality, whether expressed as not meeting a standard, functional limitation or disutility directly. In applying the net benefit correspondence theorem to hospitals a clinical activity level is suggested, to allow correspondence conditions to be robustly satisfied in identification of effects with decision analytic methods, adjustment for within DRG risk factors and data linkage to effects beyond separation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public hospitals</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Hospital care</field><field name="subject">Quality control</field><field name="subject">Administration</field><field name="subject">Cost of operation</field><field name="subject">Quality assurance</field><field name="subject">Evidence-based medicine</field><field name="subject">Medical policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the dynamic relationship between different types of investment flow and prices</field><field name="creator">OH, Natalie Yoon-na, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents three related essays on the dynamic relationship between different types of investment flow and prices in the equity market. These studies attempt to provide greater insight into the evolution of prices by investigating not ???what moves prices??? but ???who moves prices??? by utilising a unique database from the Korean Stock Exchange.  The first essay investigates the trading behaviour and performance of online equity investors in comparison to other investors on the Korean stock market. Whilst the usage of online resources for trading is becoming more and more prevalent in financial markets, the literature on the role of online investors and their impact on prices is limited. The main finding arising from this essay supports the claim that online investors are noise traders at an aggregate level. Whereas foreigners show distinct trading patterns as a group in terms of consensus on the direction of market movements, online investors do not show such distinct trading patterns. The essay concludes that online investors do not trade on clear information signals and introduce noise into the market. Direct performance and market timing ability measures further show that online investors are the worst performers and market timers whereas foreign investors consistently show outstanding performance and market timing ability.  Domestic mutual funds in Korea have not been extensively researched. The second essay analyses mutual fund activity and relations between stock market returns and mutual fund flows in Korea. Although regulatory authorities have been cautious about introducing competing funds, contractual-type mutual funds have not been cannibalized by the US-style corporate mutual funds that started trading in 1998. Negative feedback trading activity is observed between stock market returns and mutual fund flows, measured as net trading volumes using stock purchases and sales volume. It is predominantly returns that drive flows, although stock purchases contain information about returns, partially supporting the price pressure hypothesis. After controlling for declining markets, the results suggest Korean equity fund managers tend to swing indiscriminately between increasing purchases and increasing sales in times of rising market volatility, possibly viewing volatility as an opportunity to profit and defying the mean-variance framework that predicts investors should retract from the market as volatility increases. Mutual funds respond indifferently to wide dispersions in investor beliefs.  The third essay focuses on the conflicting issue of home bias by looking at the impact on domestic prices of foreign trades relative to locals using high frequency data from the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE). This essay extends the work of Choe, Kho and Stulz (2004) (CKS) in three ways. First, it analyses the post-Asian financial crisis period, whereas CKS (2004) analyse the crisis (1996-98) period. Second, this essay adopts a modified version of the CKS method to better capture the aggregate behaviour of each investor-type by utilising the participation ratio in comparison to the CKS method. Third, this essay does not limit investigation to intra-day analysis but extends to daily analysis up to 50 days to observe the effect of intensive trading activity in a longer horizon than the CKS study. In contrast to the CKS findings, this paper finds that foreigners have a short-lived private information advantage over locals and trades by foreigners have a larger impact on prices using intra-day data. However, assuming investors buy-hold for up to 50 days, the local individuals provide a greater impact and more profitable returns than foreigners. Superior performance is documented for buys rather than sells.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">investor types</field><field name="subject">price discovery</field><field name="subject">volume and price relationship</field><field name="subject">Stocks</field><field name="subject">Prices</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="subject">South</field><field name="subject">Investments</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation mechanisms in TiN-based thin film structures</field><field name="creator">Ma, Lok Wang, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The deformation mechanisms and contact response of TiN-based thin films deposited onto a soft substrate using a physical vapour deposition (PVD) technique is still an area of both technological importance and considerable discussion. These coatings are commonly applied to various kinds of steel cutting tools, creating surfaces with enhanced tribological properties. However, no extensive systematic study of the deformation mechanisms in these thin film systems has been performed to date.  In the present study, the effect of the coating microstructure, indenter geometry, coating thickness and substrate hardness on the deformation mechanisms in both TiN and TiAlN coatings of varying thickness deposited onto ductile steel substrates has been investigated using a combination of nanoindentation and microstructural analysis, including focused ion beam (FIB) milling and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Different modes of cracking, such as columnar and transverse cracking, as well as shear steps at the coating/substrate interface, were observed. The microstructure of the TiN coatings was found to be very important in controlling their modes of deformation. Thicker coatings were seen to contain more equiaxed grains, so less columnar shearing occurred and inclined cracks were found to be a more dominant fracture type in the thicker coating. Also, it was found that soft substrates absorbed most of the energy from indentation by plastic deformation.  It was found that both the TiN and TiAlN/TiN dual-layer coatings exhibited broadly similar mechanisms of deformation. The epitaxial interface between the TiAlN and TiN in the dual-layer coating did not appear to affect the deformation behaviour.  As a further investigation of the overall deformation behaviour for the coating/substrate systems studied, a DualBeam FIB was used to generate three dimensional images of the indented regions which provided additional information on the crack morphology.  For the first time, a systematic study of the deformation behaviour of TiN and TiAlN coatings upon indentation has been carried out. FIB milling was demonstrated to be a highly appropriate technique for characterization of the deformation behaviour of these coatings, allowing detailed, high resolution microstructural investigations to be performed in both two and three dimensions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="subject">Testing</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="subject">Titanium nitride</field><field name="subject">Deformations Mechanics</field><field name="subject">Microstructure</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Ion implantation</field><field name="subject">Vapor plating</field><field name="subject">Nitrides</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological effects of GSM mobile phone microwave radiation: an investigation of gene expression</field><field name="creator">Blood, Alan, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is evidence that athermal radiofrequency radiation can alter Heat Shock Protein (HSP) expression or protein phosphorylation, or alter MAP kinase signalling. Effects of long-term exposure in brain tissue due to repeated HSP perturbation (eg an inhibition of apoptosis) have been hypothesised (French et al, 2001). This study aimed to investigate the RNA expression profile (12,000 genes) and HSP family protein expression levels after either acute 1-hour or chronic 4-day intermittent exposures to simulated GSM radiation in a human primary fibroblast model. The results found minimal or no effects of GSM. Flasks were exposed to 900 MHz (217 Hz modulation) at 0.18 W/kg SAR within a Transverse Electromagnetic Mode chamber (TEM cell). Cultures rested for 2 hours before exposures. Affymetrix U95A microarray analysis of a single pilot set of experiments showed that about 40 genes were reported as upregulated &amp;gt=2.5 fold in each condition. There was no evidence of altered expression of any MAPK-associated genes. Target genes reported in both conditions (CBFA2T1, ZNF148, ITGA1), and genes altered in one condition (CCS, PLEC1, BIRC5), and marginally altered HSP72 were selected for PCR analysis. No other members of the HSP family were altered. In three replicate experiments assayed by real-time PCR, six genes were either unchanged or showed randomly variable expression. However HSP72 RNA showed possible consistent slight upregulation of 1.37 +/- 0.21 in the chronic condition. Western immunoblots of HSP-60, -70, -72 and -V90 proteins showed no significant changes 5 hours after exposure. In preliminary studies using a serum starvation protocol, ERK-1 phosphorylation was unaltered after 5 or 30 minutes GSM (single experiments). When flasks were transiently cooled, ERK-1 phosphorylation was increased 20 minutes later, indicating a source of artefact in some protocols. An inflammatory challenge experiment with a low-dose of the cytokine IL-1???? found that acute GSM exposure post-challenge inhibited NF????B-mediated GRO???? induction by 1.5 fold (2 experiments). Preconditioning with mild heat induces transient inhibition of both NF????B signalling and apoptosis. Other studies indicate that EMF exposures similarly evoke cytoprotection. It is suggested that GSM evoked cytoprotective signalling in this inflammatory model.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular telephones</field><field name="subject">Mobile phones</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Global system for mobile communications</field><field name="subject">GSM</field><field name="subject">Heat shock proteins</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic fields</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetism</field><field name="subject">EMF</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Microwaves</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inorganic hydrogeochemistry, hydrogeology and geology of the Stuarts Point aquifer system : a process analysis of the natural occurrences of enriched As(III) and As(V) in an Australian coastal groundwater system</field><field name="creator">Smith, James V.  S., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Arsenic (As) in groundwater systems is a problem in many parts of the world owing to ever-increasing extraction of groundwater resources to meet the needs of growing populations. Surprisingly, the occurrence of elevated As concentrations in coastal sandy aquifers has only recently been published as a result of this research. Sandy aquifers are commonly used as a clean and reliable source of water for domestic, agricultural and industrial needs due to their high recharge rates and the filtering capacity of sands. Water quality monitoring in Australian sandy aquifers is usually limited to a small suite of major elements and salinity measurements to determine the quality of groundwater and to identify any potential problems from seawater intrusion as a result of over extraction. Minor and trace elements, particularly toxic elements, have largely been ignored in regular monitoring programs. Prompted by an emerging pattern of human health problems in a community reliant on groundwater, hydrogeochemical investigations of the Stuarts Point coastal sand aquifer, on the North Coast of New South Wales, Australia, identified elevated As concentrations of up to 337 ????g/L in the catchment's Pleistocene barrier sands. These concentrations are well in excess of the World Health Organisation and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council water quality criteria of 10 and 7 ????g/L respectively. From research into the Stuarts Point geology, geochemistry, geomorphology, hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry, and with the assistance of environmental isotopes, the spatial distribution, occurrence and mobilisation processes of As were determined. The presence and distribution of elevated As concentrations in the regional coastal aquifer system are sporadic and involve a series of complex hydrogeochemical processes. No single hydrogeochemical process can describe the release of As from solid phase to groundwater system on the regional scale. Processes of competitive exchange with PO43- and HCO3-, reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides and arsenical pyrite oxidation, though not forming dominant correlations, are still evident and influence As chemistry at this scale. Detailed investigations of the hydrogeochemistry on the vertical scale have identified two main processes as causing As to be released and mobilised. The first process is associated with the oxidation of arsenical pyrite in Acid Sulphate Soils and metal hydrolysis reactions which mobilise As in the acidic environment. In the absence of dissolved oxygen (DO), NO3- acts as the oxyanion facilitating arsenical pyrite oxidation and releasing As into solution. The second process that mobilises As from the sediments is the liberation of As from metal-oxyhydroxides in the carbon-rich environment, where HCO3- originates from the dissolution of shell material in the Pleistocene barrier sands. The marine influenced depositional history and geomorphology of the aquifer provide opportunities for As to become incorporated into the aquifers matrix in a variety of mineral forms, which is an occurrence not considered to be unique to the Stuarts Point catchment. The findings presented here are amongst the first detailed studies of naturally occurring As in an Australian groundwater system as well as in the Pleistocene coastal sand aquifer environment. The understanding of As accumulation and mobilisation identified as a result of this research emphasises the need for potential As occurrences in similar groundwater systems in other coastal environments in Australia, and globally, to be considered.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reliability and clinical validity of functional magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of language in pre-surgical patients with temporal lobe epilepsy</field><field name="creator">Adcock, Jane Elizabeth, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Defining language lateralisation is important to minimise morbidity in patients treated surgically for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a promising, non-invasive, alternative strategy to the Wada test. Here, fMRI has been used to study healthy controls and patients with TLE in order (i) to define language-related activation patterns and their reproducibility; (ii) to compare lateralisation determined by fMRI with that from the Wada test; and (iii) to explore the usefulness of multiple fMRI language paradigms. 18 healthy controls (12 right-handed and 6 left-handed) and 24 pre-operative TLE patients (19 right-handed: 12 left-TLE, 7 right-TLE; 5 left-handed: 2 right-TLE, 3 left-TLE) were studied using fMRI. Four fMRI language paradigms used: phonetic and semantic fluency, and the naming of living and non-living things. The data for all 4 tasks were acquired during a single scanning session on two occasions. All patients also underwent Wada testing. In patients and controls, phonetic and semantic fluency tasks were robustly activating and strongly lateralising. Quantified language-related lateralisation from fMRI verbal fluency data was highly reproducible and concordant with the lateralisation of the Wada test. Both fluency tasks identified patients with atypical language lateralisation, including 4/12 right-handed patients with left-TLE and 4/5 left-handed TLE patients, regardless of the side of epileptic focus. In comparison, the two confrontational naming tasks were not strongly lateralising and did not reliably agree with Wada lateralisation in either 12 right-handed controls or 19 right-handed patients with TLE. However, there was a difference in the pattern of fMRI activation in right-handed pat ients with left-TLE. Left-TLE patients had a more right lateralised network of activation when naming living things relative to non-living things, suggesting that some patients may be at risk of a category specific naming decline for non-living things after left anterior temporal lobectomy. These results demonstrate that non-invasive fMRI measures of languagerelated lateralisation may provide a practical and reliable alternative to invasive testing for pre-surgical language lateralisation in patients with TLE. The high proportion of TLE patients showing atypical language lateralisation suggests considerable plasticity of language representation in the brains of patients with intractable TLE.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temporal lobe epilepsy</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">diagnostic use.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stones, ripples, waves: refiguring The first stone media event</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Anthea, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary study critically revisits the Australian print media???s engagement with Helen Garner???s controversial work of ???non-fiction???, The First Stone (1995). Print news media engagement with the book, marked by intense discursive contestation over feminism, has been constituted both by feminists and other critics as a significant cultural signpost. However, the highly visible print media event following the book???s publication raised a plethora of critical questions and dilemmas that remain unsatisfactorily addressed. Building upon John Fiske???s work on media events as sites of maximum visibility and discursive turbulence (Fiske: 1996), this study re-theorises the public dialogue following The First Stone???s publication in terms of four constitutive elements: narrative, celebrity, audience, and history and conflict. Through an analysis of these four diverse yet interconnected aspects of the media event, I create a critical space not only for its limitations to emerge but also the frequently overlooked possibilities it offers in terms of the wider feminism and print media culture relationship. As part of its central aim to refigure The First Stone media event, this thesis argues against prior characterisations of the debate as constitutive of either a monologic articulation of conservative, antifeminist voices or an unmitigated attack on its author by a homogenous feminism. In particular, I use this media event as indicative of the sophistication and complexity of media engagement with contemporary feminism, despite both continued derision and overly simplistic celebration of this relationship. Texts subject to analysis here include: The First Stone, various ???mainstream??? media representations and self-representations of three ???celebrity feminists??? (Helen Garner, Anne Summers and Jenna Mead), letters to the editor of newspapers and magazines, ???popular??? feminist books by Kathy Bail and Virginia Trioli, and a number of media texts in which those claiming a feminist subject position and those sympathetic to feminism act as either news sources or columnists/commentators. Although Garner???s narrative is throughout identified to be deeply problematic, I argue that the media event it precipitated provides valuable insights into both the opportunities and the constraints of the print media-feminism nexus in 1990s Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Garner</field><field name="subject">Helen</field><field name="subject">First stone; Women novelists</field><field name="subject">Australian; Mass media -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion. The findings from this thesis provide insights on tacit collusion in an oligopoly and policy implications from a learning perspective. With modelling flexibility, our co-evolutionary approach can be extended to study strategic behaviour in an oligopoly considering many other market characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Price fixing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Finance -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Oligopolies -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A competency based theory of business partnering : an empirical study of Australian business-to-business partnerships</field><field name="creator">Gray, David Michael, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research, conceptualizes, operationalises and empirically tests a competency-based theory of business-partnering performance within an Australian business-partnering context. Drawing on theory from social psychology and marketing, the research integrates a number of theoretical approaches including resource-based theory, competency based theory, relational factors view, relational interaction theory, and competitive advantage theory to explain why some business partnerships are more successful than others are. The results use a ???process model of business-partnering??? performance to explain the interaction process through which business partners exploit the available partnering related ???operant resources??? and how these resources influence the performance of business partnerships and their ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Specifically, this research investigates a number of important internal resources, which facilitate the building, and maintaining of external businesspartner relations including ???joint alliance competence???, ???joint alliance structure???, ???interpersonal relational competence??? and ???market orientation???. This research shows that an adequate understanding of how these ???operant resources??? are deployed/accessed and co-created by the business partners to achieve a competitive advantage requires integration of ???relational interaction theory??? into ???resource-based theory??? and ???competency-based theory???. The results of this research show that those firms that pursue business partnerships as a competitive strategy can improve performance by engaging in a range of activities, which facilitate the building of ???relational capital??? of the partnership. The results provide support for conclusion that ???communication behaviour??? is a central and important mediating variable in the performance of business partnerships. Overall, the findings are consistent with the literature in finding support for the notion that ???joint alliance competence??? is a direct antecedent of businesspartnering performance. There is support for the notion that the partnership???s ability to govern and manage itself is an important determinant of ???communication behaviour??? and ???co-ordination behaviour???. The results identified ???market orientation???, ???co-ordination behaviour??? and ???relational capital??? as all having a direct influence on business-partnership profitability. Finally, given the relatively high failure rates of business partnerships this research provides greater opportunity for a discussion of the kinds of intervention strategies that could be used to minimise the risk of failure and/or to improve partnership performance.

The synthesis of novel bidentate phosphine-pyrazolyl, phosphine-imidazolyl (P-N) and phosphine-NHC (PC) donor ligands and their cationic and neutral rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes [M(P N)(COD)]BPh4, [M(PC)(COD)]BPh4, [Ir(P-N)(CO)2]BPh4 and [M(P-N)(CO)Cl] were successfully performed. An unusual five coordinate iridium complex with phosphine-NHC ligands [Ir(PC)(COD)(CO)]BPh4 was also obtained. Seventeen single crystal X-ray structures of these new complexes were determined. A range of these novel rhodium and iridium complexes were effective as catalysts for the addition of thiophenol to a variety of alkynes. Iridium complexes were more effective than rhodium analogues. Cationic complexes were more effective than neutral complexes. Complexes with hybrid phosphine-nitrogen donor were more effective than complexes containing bidentate nitrogen donor ligands. An atom-economical, efficient method for the synthesis of cyclic acetals and bicyclic O,O-acetals was successfully developed based on the catalysed hydroalkoxylation. Readily prepared terminal and non-terminal alkyne diols were cyclised into bicyclic O,O-acetals in quantitative conversions in most cases. The efficiency of a range of rhodium and iridium complexes containing bidentate P-N and PC donor ligands as catalysts for the cyclisation of 4-pentyn-1-amine to 2-methyl-1-pyrroline varied significantly. The cationic iridium complexes with the bidentate phosphine-pyrazolyl ligands, [Ir(R2PyP)(COD)]BPh4 (2.39-2.42) were extremely efficient as catalysts for this transformation. Increasing the size of the substituent on or adjacent to the donor led to improvement in catalytic activity of the corresponding metal complexes. The mechanism of the catalysed hydroalkoxylation was proposed to proceed by the initial activation of the alkyne via ?? coordination to the metal centre. The ?? binding of both aliphatic and aromatic alkynes to [Ir(PyP)(CO)2]BPh4 (2.44) was observed by low temperature NMR and no reaction between 2.44 and alcohols was observed. In contrast, the facility in which thiol and amine oxidatively added to 2.44 led the proposal that in the hydrothiolation and hydroamination reaction, the catalytic cycle commences with the activation of the X-H bond (X = S, N) by an oxidative addition process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homegeneous catalysis</field><field name="subject">hybrid ligands</field><field name="subject">P-N ligands</field><field name="subject">NHC ligands</field><field name="subject">hydroamination</field><field name="subject">hydroalkoxylation</field><field name="subject">hydrothiolation</field><field name="subject">spiroketals</field><field name="subject">rhodium catalysts</field><field name="subject">iridium catalysts</field><field name="subject">metal complexes</field><field name="subject">alkynes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contingent corporate governance: a challenge to universal theories of board structure</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Meredith, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Agency theory proposes that the role of the board of directors is to control management (Fama &amp; Jensen 1983). A structurally independent board, one with a high percentage of non-executive directors and a chairperson who is not the CEO, has been used as a proxy for the control role. Therefore, agency theory predicts a positive relationship between independent board structure and firm performance. These predictions have not been confirmed by meta-analytic reviews (Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand, &amp; Johnson 1998; Rhoades, Rechner, &amp; Sundaramurthy 2000). This thesis applies structural contingency theory to provide an alternative explanation for the relationship between board structure and firm performance. Structural contingency theory (Donaldson 2001) proposes that the relationship between an organization???s structure and its performance is moderated by contingencies. In this study the contingency is the salience of the board???s control role. I argue that structural independence of the board has a beneficial effect on performance only if it is in fit with control salience. For example, a firm with an independently structured board that gives high prominence to the control role will perform well. On the other hand, another firm with a less independently structured board that does not see its main role as controlling management will also prosper. Survey data were analyzed to measure the control salience for 98 Australian listed companies. Archival data provided measures of board structure and firm performance. Consistent with the meta-analytic reviews, there was no association between independent board structure and firm performance. There was some evidence that high control salience resulted in high performance, but this effect was evident chiefly when performance was measured by total shareholder returns. This may indicate that the share market was responding to the symbolism of high control salience. In contrast to the symbolic main effect of control salience, the fit between the control salience and the independent structure of the board caused increased return on equity. This reflects the board???s objective effect on profit when its structure is in fit with control salience.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Structural contingency theory</field><field name="subject">Board structure</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Board of directors</field><field name="subject">Misfit</field><field name="subject">Directors of corporations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The properties and evolution of galaxy populations in the rich cluster environment</field><field name="creator">Pracy, Michael Benjamin, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the role the rich cluster environment plays in the evolution of its galaxy population. We approach this issue from two angles, first we use deep wide-field imaging to investigate the effect of the cluster environment on the spatial and luminosity distribution of galaxies. Secondly, we focus on one particularly interesting class of galaxy, the enigmatic E+A galaxies, using a combination of state-of-the-art telescopes and novel instrumentation to elucidate the physical mechanisms and environmental influences causing the rapid change in star-formation activity in these galaxies.  We present results from a deep photometric study of the rich galaxy cluster Abell 2218 (z=0.18) based on Hubble Space Telescope images. These have been used to derive the cluster luminosity function to extremely faint limits. We find the faint-end slope of the luminosity function to vary with environment within the cluster - in the sense that the ratio of `dwarf' galaxies to `giant' galaxies increases in the lower-density outskirt regions. Using imaging obtained with the Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) we confirm the presence of luminosity segregation in Abell 2218. However, luminosity segregation in clusters does not appear to be ubiquitous, with two other clusters studied with the INT (A119 at z=0.04 and A2443 at z=0.11) showing no sign of luminosity segregation of their galaxy populations.  We use integral field spectroscopy of a sample of E+A galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters, obtained with the FLAMES system on the European Southern Observatory's VLT and the GMOS instrument on Gemini-North, to determine the radial variation in the strength of Hdelta absorption in these galaxies, and hence map out the distribution of the recently formed stellar population. We find a diversity of behaviour amongst these galaxies in terms of the radial variation in Hdelta absorption: with  gradients that are either  negative, flat, or positive. By comparing with numerical simulations we suggest that the first of these different types of radial behaviour provides evidence for a merger/interaction origin, whereas the latter two types of behaviour are more consistent with the truncation of star formation in normal disk galaxies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">galaxies</field><field name="subject">galaxy evolution</field><field name="subject">galaxy clusters</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Don DeLillo's promiscuous fictions:the adulterous triangle of sex, space, and language</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Diana Marie, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis takes up J. G. Ballard's contention, that 'the act of intercourse is now always a model for something else,' to show that Don DeLillo uses a particular sexual, cultural economy of adultery, understood in its many loaded cultural and literary contexts, as a model for semantic reproduction. I contend that DeLillo's fiction evinces a promiscuous model of language that structurally reflects the myth of the adulterous triangle. The thesis makes a significant intervention into DeLillo scholarship by challenging Paul Maltby's suggestion that DeLillo's linguistic model is Romantic and pure. My analysis of the narrative operations of adultery in his work reveals the alternative promiscuous model. I discuss ten DeLillo novels and one play - Americana, Players, The Names, White Noise, Libra, Mao II,Underworld, the play Valparaiso, The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, and the pseudonymousAmazons - that feature adultery narratives. I demonstrate that these narratives resist conservative models of language, space, and sex by using promiscuity as a method of narrative control. I argue that DeLillo's adultery narratives respond subversively to attempts to categorise his work, and that he extends the mythologised rhetoric of the adulterous triangle by adopting sexual transgression as a three-sided semantic structure that connects language, sex, and space. I refer to theories of narrative, postmodernity, space, desire, and parody to show that DeLillo's adultery narratives structurally influence his experiments with linguistic meaning. My analysis reveals that contradiction performs at several spatial, sexual, and dialogical levels to undermine readings that suggest DeLillo's language models pure meaning. I identify the sexualised fissure within DeLillo's semantic style that is exposed by the operation of contradiction. I believe this gap distinguishes DeLillo from postmodern fiction's emphasis on the placeless, because it is a meaningful space that emphasises the reproductive adulteration of signification. I expose several sites of dialectic rupture, including the hotel/motel room, oppositional and metaphorical description, the journey, the image, and the secret. I contend that sex in these transgressive narratives is a model for something else: promiscuous meaning. This thesis demonstrates that DeLillo's fiction charts the typography of the mythical third side of the adulterous triangle in order to respond to language's own promiscuity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DeLillo, Don - Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Adultery in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The loanword (Gairaigo) influx into the Japanese language: contemporary perceptions and responses</field><field name="creator">Tomoda, Takako, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Loanwords have been entering Japanese for centuries but the rate has accelerated postwar and the predominant source is English. Gairaigo have received a mixed response from scholars, government, the media and the public. Opponents claim they cause confusion and have called for limits to protect the language and culture. From the 1980s, language planning bodies turned their attention to gairaigo and, in the early 2000s, took steps to limit their use. This research examines and evaluates the perceptions and responses of Japanese people and language planners to gairaigo over this period. Scholarly and popular works, the media, and policy discussions by language planners were analysed under the rubric of corpus planning proposed by Ferguson (1979) and Cooper (1989). The level of purism was evaluated within the framework of Thomas (1991). To obtain quantitative data on public perceptions of gairaigo, a survey was conducted and the results compared with published opinion poll data. Scholars who supported gairaigo concentrated on its enrichment of the corpus, imagery, nuance, and its internationalising effects. Opponents focused on the confusing nature of new gairaigo particularly for older people, damage to the language and culture, creation of social divisions, and excessive Westernisation. Both globalisation and universal English education were considered causes of the influx. Policy discussions focused on comprehension levels of new gairaigo, generational differences, and overuse of gairaigo by government, especially in aged care. Lists of replacement words were produced but public response has been mixed. A majority of people surveyed expressed negative views of gairaigo, but only a small minority held strong views. Most were tolerant of gairaigo use and were willing to use new gairaigo. Tolerance decreased with age but there was no clear relationship with English language ability. Opinion poll data did not demonstrate any longitudinal increase in negative views of gairaigo over the 1980s and 90s. It was concluded that public support for government intervention was generally weak and was not assisted by the archaising approach taken to replacing gairaigo with kango. Recommendations for alternative responses were made.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership behaviours of heads of schools and departments in Australian and Pakistani universities</field><field name="creator">Zaidi, Atiya H., Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines transformational and transactional leadership behaviours of heads of schools/departments, and the individual level cultural dimensions idiocentrism-allocentrism, as perceived by academic staff in Australian and Pakistani universities. The principal research aim was to investigate the relationships between academics??? attributions concerning leadership behaviours of heads of schools/departments and cultural norms in a collectivistic and an individualistic culture. Samples of academic staff were randomly selected from Australian and Pakistani universities. The Australian sample consisted of 117 academics, and the Pakistani sample comprised 120 academics. Analysis was carried out using exploratory factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, and discriminant analysis. Within the context of the research, the results suggested that Australian and Pakistani university academics had similar attribution patterns for entities related to transformational, transactional, and passive leadership behaviours, and the cultural dimension allocentrism. The results also suggested that the academics of both samples did not differentiate between various transformational leadership behaviours, and perceived the transactional leadership behaviour contingent reward as part of the transformational leadership behaviour proactive leadership. Further, the academics of both samples perceived the transactional leadership behaviour passive management-by-exception and laissez-faire leadership as a single dimension, passive leadership. Analyses identified some critical relationships between perceived leadership behaviours of heads of schools/departments and idiocentrism-allocentrism variables for the two samples. The transformational leadership behaviour participative leadership was positively related to allocentrism and self-reliance for the Australian sample. The transactional leadership behaviour active management-by-exception was positively related to positive-competitiveness and negatively related to negative-competitiveness for the Pakistani sample. Passive leadership was negatively related to leadership outcomes for the Pakistani sample. Moreover, active management-by-exception and positive-competitiveness discriminated between the two samples.

Rh-promoted Fe2O3-Cr2O3 was found to offer best performance which was significantly better than unpromoted catalyst over wide temperatures range. An extensive literature survey is first reported. Guidelines to develop new WGS catalysts are developed. As a result, the activities of precious metals supported on various oxides for high temperature WGS reaction have been tested. Rh(1wt%) doped Fe2O3/Cr2O3, exhibits the highest activity for WGS over a wide temperature range. 5wt%CuO/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/U3O8, 1wt%Pt/10%U3O8-Al2O3 and 1wt%Pt/5%V2O5-TiO2 fall into the second most active catalysts group, with an improved activity compared to commercial Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalyst. It is clear that both the support/catalyst and the promoter can affect the efficiency of the WGS, leading to the obvious inference that the reaction rate is controlled at the promoter ??? support interface. Further kinetic studies and characterisation (TPR, TPD, pulse-adsorption (reaction)) on Rh/Fe3O4/Cr2O3 have been conducted. The study, conducted under conditions without inhibition from products of both forward and backward reactions, shows that the overall reaction rate expression is described as: 2 22 ??? =0.0041exp(???4042.6 ) 0.64 0.5 ???0.024 exp(???6022.9 ) 0.46 0.73 CO CO H O CO H r PP P P T T . Kinetics studies carried out under fuel reforming gas compositions shows that reaction rate expression changed when the temperature of reaction varied. The reaction rate equations at temperatures of 573K, 623K and 673K are derived as: 573K: 2 2 2 - 2.84 10-6 0.6 0.12 - 9.08 10-7 0.09 0.52 rCO = ?? PCO PH O ??

TPR, TPD, TPO characterisation studies and reoxidation of catalysts by CO2 or H2O show that the active site for high temperature WGS reaction on Rh/Fe2O3/Cr2O3 is reduced magnetite Fe3O4 which dissociatively breaks down the H2O to form H* and OH* and adsorbs CO2. The deposited metal, Rh, acts as a promoter by facilitating the uptake of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), desorption of H2 (at high temperature) and CO2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">iron oxides</field><field name="subject">chromium</field><field name="subject">catalysts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitation of action learning groups: an action research investigation</field><field name="creator">Ball, Dianne Lesley, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisational Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to better understand the role of the facilitator in action learning groups. In particular, it focuses on groups established within an organisation, in which the facilitator is a member of the organisation. The two central research questions are: (1) How did the facilitator influence problem solving and group interactions, and how did this vary over time and between each group, and (2) How did the facilitator's role in the organisation impact on the action learning groups? The methodology of action research and a number of principles of grounded theory are employed. The investigation was conducted within a large public teaching hospital over a two year period. Four groups volunteered to participate in the project. Two of these groups were already established and two were newly created for the purpose of the research project. The groups came from different departments and members represented a range of professional backgrounds. The size of the groups ranged from 5 to 12 participants. Each group identified a real and significant project to work through using an action learning approach. The researcher negotiated with each group what it wanted from a facilitator role, and then facilitated each meeting. All group meetings and individual interviews were audiotaped and the facilitator kept journal notes after each meeting or interview. Two potential methodological issues arose. The first related to the application of some of the principles of grounded theory to the action research investigation. The second was that the study was conducted in the researcher???s own organisation while the researcher was employed full-time, and this posed particular issues. Literature related to action learning, process consultation and small group facilitation was explored in the literature review. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate different perspectives and approaches by frequently cited authors in these subjects, and to understand the uses and limitations of existing models. This gave the researcher an understanding of gaps in the literature related to (1) the role of the facilitator of action learning groups, and (2) conducting research in one???s organisation.  Data were analysed for each group separately and then compared and contrasted in the final chapter. The objectives of the analysis were to (1) examine how the findings for each individual group address the research questions, (2) explore how the findings in each group change over time, and (2) examine how and why the findings in the groups were similar and different to each other. The findings across each of the groups have similarities and differences. There were seven interventions used by the facilitator that were common across the groups. The interventions changed over the duration of the project. Process skills were required to different degrees and at different times. Nine hypotheses were developed as the theory. Some key findings are as follows. First, it was found that groups that have not had prior experience in action learning do not understand the concept and process of facilitation and are unable to articulate in advance what they want from the facilitator. Second, the role of the facilitator cannot be separated from the skills, values and understandings of the individual facilitator. Third, a major role of the facilitator in this investigation was sharing knowledge of the organisation, the broader health care sector, and general management. In each group the facilitator performed both process and content roles, and a further role that can be called ????????????contextualising???. The findings show there is a distinction between the theoretical role and the role of an individual facilitator in practice. Further research opportunities are identified. These include (1) understanding how participants who have been involved in a facilitated action learning group may be able to apply their experience in a non-facilitated action learning group; (2) comparing the needs and expectations of participants in a facilitated action learning group within an organisation with action learning participants who are not part of an organisation; (3) understanding how facilitation of an action learning group within an organisation may change if the facilitator is in a management role, or in a peer position with participants.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group facilitation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making space to breathe : values, identity and accountability in a faith-based NGO</field><field name="creator">Kurti, Linda, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project examines the impact on a Christian mission organisation of the decision to accept government funding and add an explicit international development focus to its work. During the 1980s the Anglican Board of Mission (ABM), the national mission agency of the Anglican Church of Australia, entered into a contractual relationship with the Australian Government which ultimately led to accreditation as a development agency and involvement with the Australian international development sector. This process has significantly influenced ABM both structurally and philosophically, bringing a creative tension within the organisation between two related but distinct approaches to Christian witness. A cooperative inquiry method was chosen with the aim of fostering organisational learning within ABM. The researcher became a participant in a team of five which conducted three cycles of inquiry over a year. This team of staff members and the researcher explored the influence of the growing relationship with government on their faith-based NGO and its implications within the context of Christian mission. Notions of intentionality, accountability and legitimacy within the relationships with their stakeholders emerged as significant foundations for the work of the organisation. The cycles of inquiry generated a body of co-created knowledge which, it is argued, have pointed the way to managing ABM???s dual roles. Its multiple accountabilities - to government, to its Anglican constituency, and to overseas church partners - are understood as offering a framework through which it can continually assess its organisational integrity and fidelity to its value base. Articulating intentionality of purpose and a clear theological understanding of mission and development were identified as crucial if ABM is to maintain its legitimacy as derived from the mandate of the Anglican Church to undertake Christian mission and development on its behalf. ???Making space to breathe??? became a metaphor to describe the task of the organisation in creating both a reflective space which opens possibilities for transformed praxis, and a liminal space between the two Programs of the organisation in which a unifying philosophical ground can be discovered.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-governmental organizations</field><field name="subject">nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking jurisdictionally: a genealogy of native title</field><field name="creator">Dorsett, Shaunnagh, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Mabo v. State of Queensland (No. 2) (1992) 175 C.L.R. 1, the majority of the High Court held that ???native title??? had survived the acquisition of sovereignty over the Australian continent and is ???recognised??? by the common law. However, all the judgments failed to articulate clearly either the nature of native title as a legal form, and the relationship of that legal form to the common law, or what is meant by ???recognition???. Twelve years later the High Court has still not provided a satisfactory understanding of any of these matters. The central problem investigated by this thesis is the nature of that relationship and of the legal interest of native title. It is contended that this relationship can be understood and ordered as a matter of jurisdiction. This thesis seeks to recuperate a substantive concept of jurisdiction, and specifically of a particular jurisdiction, that of the common law, and to demonstrate how the interest of native title results from the jurisdictional relationship between common law and indigenous law. Part I is a genealogy of native title, drawn out through a history of ideas about common law jurisdiction. It is an account of the legal practice of jurisdiction, through a conceptual elaboration of a particular jurisdiction: the common law. This part traces the history of the common law from its origins in a pluralistic, fragmented, jurisdictional landscape, to its current position as the ???law of the land???. It considers the traditional mechanisms and techniques through which the common law has ordered its relationships with other jurisdictions, and how it has appropriated matters traditionally within the purview of other jurisdictions, accommodating them within the common law as ???custom???. The thesis demonstrates that the same gestures and practices can be seen in modern native title decisions, and contends that the ordering which underpins both native title, and the Australian legal system, is jurisdictional. Part II examines the practice of jurisdiction through an examination of three technologies of jurisdiction, all of which contributed to the construction of the legal entity of native title as an act of jurisdiction: mapping, accommodation and categorisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Common law -- History</field><field name="subject">Native title (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Legal status, laws, etc</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples -- Legal status, laws, etc</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rare-earth doped up-converting phosphors for an enhanced silicon solar cell response</field><field name="creator">Shalav, Avi, School of Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Photovoltaic solar cells can generate electricity directly from sunlight without emitting harmful greenhouse gases. This makes them ideal candidates as large scale future energy producers for the global energy economy.  Ideally, solar cells should be efficient and inexpensive to compete in the global energy market. Unfortunately, a number of fundamental limitations exist for the efficiency due to fundamental loss mechanisms of the semiconductor materials used to make solar cells. One of the dominant loss mechanisms from a conventional silicon solar cell is the transparency of sub-bandgap near-infrared photons.  Up-conversion is an optical process involving the sequential absorption of lower energy photons followed by luminescence of a higher energy photon.  This mechanism could be exploited to minimise photovoltaic sub-bandgap losses.  Rare-earth doped materials have ideal up-conversion luminescent properties and have been utilised for many near-infrared to visible applications.   This thesis investigates the near-infrared to near-infrared up-conversion processes required for the sub-bandgap photon utilisation within a silicon photovoltaic device. Various sodium yttrium fluoride phosphors doped with rare-earths were characterised theoretically and experimentally. Erbium doped phosphors were found to be ideal for single wavelength power dependent investigations for the non-linear up-conversion processes.  The radiative and non-radiative rates of various erbium doped sodium yttrium fluoride phosphors have been approximated and compared with experimental photoluminescence results. These phosphors have been applied to the rear of a bi-facial silicon solar cell and an enhancement in the near-infrared region has been demonstrated.  An external quantum efficiency close to 3.4% was measured at 1523nm under 6mW laser excitation.  The non-linear dependence on incident pump power has been investigated along with the dominant up-conversion mechanisms involved.  It can be concluded that up-conversion phosphors can enhance the near-infrared spectral response of a silicon device. These phosphors have high luminescent efficiencies once up-conversion occurs, but suffer from poor infrared absorption and low up-conversion efficiencies.  The results from this study show that relatively high doping levels of selected rare-earths into low phonon energy crystals can improve the absorption and luminescent properties of the phosphor.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power generation</field><field name="subject">Photovoltaic power systems</field><field name="subject">Silicon solar cells</field><field name="subject">Phosphors -- Spectra</field><field name="subject">Rare earth metals -- Spectra</field><field name="subject">Luminescence</field><field name="subject">Solar energy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of instruction memory for embedded systems</field><field name="creator">Janapsatya, Andhi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents methodologies for improving system performance and energy consumption by optimizing the memory hierarchy performance. The processor-memory performance gap is a well-known problem that is predicted to get worse, as the performance gap between processor and memory is widening. The author describes a method to estimate the best L1 cache configuration for a given application. In addition, three methods are presented to improve the performance and reduce energy in embedded systems by optimizing the instruction memory. Performance estimation is an important procedure to assess the performance of the system and to assess the effectiveness of any applied optimizations. A cache memory performance estimation methodology is presented in this thesis. The methodology is designed to quickly and accurately estimate the performance of multiple cache memory configurations. Experimental results showed that the methodology is on average 45 times faster compared to a widely used tool (Dinero IV). The first optimization method is a software-only method, called code placement, was implemented to improve the performance of instruction cache memory. The method involves careful placement of code within memory to ensure high cache hit rate when code is brought into the cache memory. Code placement methodology aims to improve cache hit rates to improve cache memory performance. Experimental results show that by applying the code placement method, a reduction in cache miss rate by up to 71%, and energy consumption reduction of up to 63% are observed when compared to application without code placement. The second method involves a novel architecture for utilizing scratchpad memory. The scratchpad memory is designed as a replacement of the instruction cache memory. Hardware modification was designed to allow data to be written into the scratchpad memory during program execution, allowing dynamic control of the scratchpad memory content. Scratchpad memory has a faster memory access time and a lower energy consumption per access compared to cache memory; the usage of scratchpad memory aims to improve performance and lower energy consumption of systems compared to system with cache memory. Experimental results show an average energy reduction of 26.59% and an average performance improvement of 25.63% when compared to a system with cache memory. The third is an application profiling method using statistical information to identify application???s hot-spots. Application profiling is important for identifying section in the application where performance degradation might occur and/or where maximum performance gain can be obtained through optimization. The method was applied and tested on the scratchpad based system described in this thesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the analysis method in reducing energy and improving performance when compared to previous method for utilizing the scratchpad memory based system (average performance improvement of 23.6% and average energy reduction of 27.1% are observed).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Cache memory</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a model for patients??? acceptance of a home telecare management system</field><field name="creator">Rahimpour, Mohammadreza, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Successful implementation of any technology requires acceptance by the users. Numerous studies in the area of information technology acceptance, based on wellknown theories have been conducted to examine technology acceptance models and predict user adoption/acceptance behaviour. There are several studies dealing with patients??? acceptance of different telemedicine applications, but few about the patients??? acceptance of home telecare. Most existing studies are not based on a strong theoretical framework. In this study, based on an extensive literature review and preliminary qualitative data, a theoretical model of the effect of Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) characteristics and psychological variables associated with technophobia on patients??? acceptance of HTMS is proposed. The proposed model is an augmented Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1986), which is called Home Telecare Management System acceptance model (HTMS-AM), in which TAM has been augmented by two constructs: HTMS anxiety and HTMS self-efficacy. The model is proposed to improve our understanding regarding patients??? acceptance of HTMS, which may lead to successful design and implementation of home telecare systems. In addition, it can be used as a theoretical basis to evaluate new generations of HTMS in terms of users acceptance in the early stage of their design and development even prior to implementation. In order to test the reliability and validity of the measures, video demonstrations of a home telecare system and demonstration of a system prototype to potential users was employed. To propose the HTMS-AM the following five stages were taken: 1. General well-known theoretical models of human behaviour from psychology and technology acceptance models from information technology were reviewed to create a basic template for the proposed model. 2. A preliminary study (focus group interviews, Chapter 5) was conducted to assess patients??? perceptions of HTMS.  3. Based on an extensive literature review and findings from preliminary qualitative studies, HTMS acceptance model was proposed, to improve our understanding about factors, which may affect patients??? intention to use HTMS. Several adaptations were applied in the model to be applicable in the HTMS context, such as augmenting the model with HTMS self-efficacy and HTMS anxiety constructs. 4. To measure the different psychological variables in the proposed model, valid and reliable measures from previous studies were used. However the preliminary study was used to develop measures, which did not exist in the literature. 5. These measures were tested in the final study. The subjects were patients who had been affected with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and/or Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD). Given the chronic nature of these diseases, the necessity for extended monitoring and management and frequent admission to hospitals due to worsening health status, these patients were deemed the most appropriate candidates for the HTMS. Further studies with more cases need to be conducted to test the actual model in which the impact of HTMS characteristics, psychological and demographic factors associated with technophobia upon intention to use the HTMS and the correlation of these factors with each other in appropriate healthcare settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concurrency control for composite objects</field><field name="creator">Shanneb, Abdelsalam Mohamed, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An essential motivation behind concurrent object-oriented systems is to exploit the software modularity and reuse potential of object-oriented features in the development of concurrent systems.

Dryland salinity has been recognised as a major environmental issue impacting soil and water resources in the Central West region of NSW for over 70 years. Due to the geological complexity of the catchment and the presence of high salt loads contained within the soils, groundwater and surface waters, the Spicers Creek catchment was identified as a large contributor of salinity to the Macquarie River catchment. Over fifty-two dryland salinity occurrences have been identified in the Spicers Creek catchment and it appears that dryland salinity is controlled by the presence of geological structures and permeability contrasts in the shallow aquifer system. Combinations of climatic, geological and agricultural factors are escalating salinity problems in the catchment. The main aim of this thesis was to identify the factors affecting salinisation processes in the Spicers Creek catchment. These include the role of geological structures, the source(s) of salts to the groundwater system and the geochemical processes influencing seepage zone development. To achieve these aims a multidisciplinary approach was untaken to understand the soils, geology, hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry of the catchment. Investigative techniques employed in this project include the use of geophysics, soil chemistry, soil spectroscopy, hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes. Evaluation of high-resolution airborne magnetics data showed a major north-east to south-west trending shear zone. This structure dissects the catchment and several other minor faults were observed to be splays off this major structure. These structures were found to be conducive to groundwater flow and are influencing the groundwater chemistry in the fractured aquifer system. Two distinctive groundwater chemical types were identified in the catchment; the saline Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters associated with the fractured Oakdale Formation and the Na-HCO3-rich groundwaters associated with the intermediate groundwater system. The groundwater chemistry of other deep groundwaters in the catchment appears to be due to mixing between these end-member groundwaters within the fractured bedrock system.  The spatial distribution of electrical conductivity, Cl-, Sr2+ and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios showed the correlation between saline groundwaters and the location of faults. Elevated salinities were associated with the location of two crosscutting fault zones. The spatial distribution of HCO3-, K+, Li+ and ?????3CDIC highlighted the extent of Na-HCO3-rich groundwaters in the catchment and showed that these groundwaters are mixing further east than previously envisaged. These findings show that Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters are geochemically distinctive and have evolved due to extensive water-rock interaction processes within the fracture zones of the Oakdale Formation. These saline groundwaters contain elevated concentrations of trace elements such as As, V and Se, which pose a potential risk for water resources in the area. 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios indicated that the source of salinity to the Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters was not purely from marine or aerosol input. Salt is most likely contributed from various allochthonous and autochthonous sources. This research found that the main mechanism controlling the formation of dryland salinity seepage zones in the Spicers Creek catchment is due to the presence of geological structures. These groundwater seepage zones act as mixing zones for rainfall recharge and deeper groundwaters. The main sources of salt to the seepage zones are from deeper Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters and rainfall accession. The major importance of this research highlights the need for an integrated approach for the use of various geoscientific techniques in dryland salinity research within geologically complex environments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Spicers Creek Catchment</field><field name="subject">soil salinization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The logos of land: economic and proprietarian conceptions of statutory access rights</field><field name="creator">Grattan, Donald Scott, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Legislation in various jurisdictions alters the common law right to control access to one???s land by allowing the imposition of rights of access in favour of one landowner over the land of another.  The relevant legislation can be divided into two categories.  The first-generation legislation (s 88K, Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) and s 180, Property Law Act 1974 (Qld)) permits the creation of easements over servient land to facilitate the development of dominant land.  The second-generation legislation (the Access to Neighbouring Land Act of New South Wales, Tasmania and the United Kingdom) permits the creation of temporary rights of access over servient land to facilitate work on dominant land.  This thesis examines the extent to which this change in the law can be justified by three modes of ethical discourse: right-based, duty-based, and goal-based reasoning.  An examination of the first-generation legislation and the cases in which it has been applied suggests that a form of goal-based reasoning can be used to justify its enactment.  The legislation is needed to facilitate the efficient use of land where the existence of a bilateral monopoly and the possibility of strategic bargaining puts at risk the conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement regarding access.  A review of the second-generation legislation and the law reform reports and parliamentary debate that preceded its enactment indicates that the legislation can be justified by a form of duty-based reasoning.  The legislation is needed to bring about a proper social ordering by imposing access rights where this would be consistent with the ideal of good neighbourliness.  The thesis concludes that although these goal-based and duty-based discourses make an arguable case for the enactment of both generations of the legislation, neither of them, in an unadulterated form, provides a conclusive justification.  Rather, an eclectic approach that draws on both discourses is required.  It proposes that the legislation???s compensation provisions be amended to reflect the commingling of the ideas of efficiency, a properly ordered society and intensive land use, and to allow the servient owner to share in the benefits generated by the imposition of access.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land tenure -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Land use -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Right of property</field><field name="subject">Law -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Law -- Interpretation and construction</field><field name="subject">Law -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In vitro and in vivo bone formation - assessment and application</field><field name="creator">Chen, Jinbiao, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Bone-grafting materials are required in orthopaedic surgery to treat bone defects. Bone formation assessment is required for the development of new strategies and approaches and for quality assurance and quality control of currently available materials. Approaches to the assessment of bone formation are yet to be systematically established, quantified and standardized.  Aims: the overall aim of this study was to establish a set of comprehensive quantitative approaches for the assessment of bone formation and to evaluate the role of osteoblastic cells, growth factors, and scaffolds on this process. Materials &amp; methods: both in vitro and in vivo parameters for osteoblast phenotype and bone formation were tested in osteosarcoma cell lines, Saos-2 and U2OS cells, mesenchymal cell line, C2C12 cells, primary adipose derived stromal cells (ADSCs), platelet rich plasma (PRP), and morselized bone grafts. The in vitro parameters used were measurement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, detection of bone nodules and biomineralization, and quantification of immunocytochemistry and conventional RT-PCR of osteoblast genotyping. In vivo parameters involved ectopic bone formation in nude mice and nude rats and a tibial defect model in nude rats. Histomorphometric and quantitative immunohistochemical analyses were also performed.  Results: The in vitro characterization and ectopic bone formation capabiltity of Saos-2 and U2OS cells have been established. Saos-2 cell line, which presents many osteoblast genotype and phenotype, is a stable positive control for both in vitro and in vivo bone formation assessments. The measurement of ALP activity in both solid and liquid phases has been standardized. Both the genotype and phenotype of osteoblast lineage cells has been quantitatively assessed during the capability testing of ADSCs and PRP. Quantitative assessment of new bone formation and related protein markers in vivo has been successfully established through the testing of the biological properties of gamma irradiated morselized bone grafts.  Conclusion: A comprehensive knowledge of the assessment of bone regeneration and formation in vitro and in vivo has been integrated and developed through years of study. A whole set of in vitro and in vivo approaches for the assessment of bone formation has been modified and standardized to best suit the different clinical applications.

However, it has not been studied as social behaviour until the last 40 years and until recently it is largely deviant behaviour that has gained the attention of sociologists. Sociology has adopted an unnecessarily antibiologistic position and consequently neglected the body. In reviewing sociological approaches to sex I draw on social constructionism, particularly the work of Gagnon and Simon (1974) and their notion of scripts; these can be interpreted as discursive structures defining sexual acts and sexual actors at both the individual and societal level. I outline a range of social constructionist positions in relation to sexuality and adopt a moderately radical but realist one that concedes some place for the physiology of arousal linking the elements of the discursive realm of the sexual in social life. Finding the basic assumptions of symbolic interactionism a fruitful base from which to approach sexual conduct I reject the concept of 'desire' as too complex and obscure to serve as a starting point in understanding the social organisation of sex.    A review of the ethnographic observational studies of settings in which men have casual sex shows that beats (public places such as parks and toilets) operate in a similar manner in many countries. Commercial sex venues are more varied. They are safer and more comfortable than beats and may offer private rooms and facilities for esoteric sex such as bondage. Sex in such settings is impersonal and anonymous, costs little effort, time or money, and offers a variety of partners. Interaction is largely nonverbal. Interview studies of men who have casual sex with other men tend to undersample men who are not gay-identified, but they offer insights into men's motivations and understandings. Both kinds of research are necessary.   The empirical component of the thesis is a thematic analysis of transcripts from three interview studies of gay men in Sydney done between 1993 and 1997: Negotiating Sex (n = 9), the Sites study (n = 21) and the Seroconversion study (n = 70). All involved detailed narratives of sexual encounters. The analysis takes a situational interactionist approach with a specific focus on practice. Central questions asked are:   how does the setting (beat, sex venue, home) affect what happens? What does sex mean to the men, and how does this affect what they do? How do men's sexual skills, tastes and experience relate to their practice? How do men's bodies and their understandings of the body affect their practice? What do different sexual practices mean and how are they organised and negotiated within the encounter? How (if at all) do men integrate considerations of safe sex into their practice?   Physical surroundings were found to have a profound effect on practice. Sex venues as cultural institutions enable patterns of practice that do not occur elsewhere. Physical arrangements within beats and venues encourage or enable particular practices, such as oral sex or group sex.   Motivations for and meanings of sex to the participants varied widely; these were related to practice within the men's own accounts but not in any clear predictive way. Men's sexual skills, tastes and preferences, which were also very varied, related to their practice. Men made trade-offs between risk and pleasure. Men looked for a range of features in casual partners. Suppression of social cues restricted the range of criteria on which partners were selected, enabling wider choice.    Men's bodies affected their practice most strikingly in the issue of erection or the lack of it. Understandings of the body and physiological processes affected men's interpretations of information about HIV risk.   These men have a vocabulary of sexual practices within which some common practices are less salient. These practices are socially patterned in ways that benefit men with certain tastes and abilities and frustrate those with others. Safe sex considerations are routinely integrated into sexual practice but in a way that leaves room for considerable risk of HIV transmission.   In conclusion I argue that conceptualising sex between men exclusively in terms of gay identity and culture is inappropriate. The outcome of the empirical work confirms the theoretical analysis that found it necessary to incorporate some physiological notions, such as 'libido', into a social constructionist view of sex. The findings and their interpretations have important implications for framing effective HIV prevention programs. Some specific suggestions are made for how this might be done.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexual practice;social constructionism;male homosexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Students Learning Statistics:  An Activity Theory Approach</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Susan Eve</field><field name="description">In this project I investigate university students orientations to learning statistics. The students who participated in my research  were studying statistics as a compulsory component of their psychology course. My central thesis is that learning develops in the  relationship between the thinking, feeling and acting person and the social, institutional and cultural contexts surrounding him or  her. How students orient themselves or position themselves to learn statistics is reflected in their engagement with the learning task  and their activities. These activities determine the quality of their learning and emerging knowledge. To understand student learning I  draw on the powerful theories of Vygotsky (1962, 1978) and Leontev (1978, 1981). In particular, I extend and apply Leontev's  construct of activity (Leontev, 1981). This suggests that individuals act in accordance with their purposes and needs which are  shaped by and reflect histories and resources, both personal and cultural.     My investigation consists of two studies. Study One is a qualitative exploration of the orientations to learning statistics of five older  students. These students sought help with statistics at the Mathematics Learning Centre where I work. My case studies of these  students are inseparable from my efforts to help them learn statistics. Study Two is grounded in Study One. The main source of  data for this broader study is a survey which was completed by 279 psychology students studying statistics. In keeping with the  theoretical framework, my methodology involves a holistic analysis of students and the milieu in which they act. My findings  suggest relationships among students affective appraisals; their conceptions of statistics; their approaches to learning it; their  evaluations and the outcomes of their actions. In Study One the relationships emerged from the students' descriptions. In Study  Two I quantified the ways in which variables related to each other. Structure for the data was provided by means of correlations,  factor analysis and cluster analysis. For this study I also interviewed students and teachers of statistics. My data support the  systemic view of teaching and learning in context afforded by my theoretical perspective. Learning statistics involves the whole  person (Semenov, 1978) and is inseparable from the arena of his or her actions.     The goal of statistics education is surely to enable students to develop useful, meaningful knowledge. My findings suggest that for  many of the participants in my project this goal was not being met. Most of these students reported their reluctance to learn statistics  and described adopting primarily surface approaches to learning it. A range of conceptions of the subject was expressed, but for  many of the students statistical meaning was evidently reduced to performance on assessment tasks. Such orientations to learning  statistics may lead to it becoming irrelevant and inert information. For a few students, however, the experience of learning statistics  led to self development and enhanced perspectives on the world in which we live. My project indicates the diversity of students'  experiences. It raises issues as to why we teach statistics today and how the teaching and learning of statistics is being supported at  university.         //REFERENCES    Leontev, A. N. (1978).

Therefore the maternal musculoskeletal system is required to adapt in both morphology and functional workload. After childbirth there is a rapid change in both mass and dimensions, requiring further adaptations. The objectives of the study were to investigate seated and standing upper body posture, the kinematics of seated and standing trunk motion, and the three dimensional kinematics and kinetics during rising to stand from a chair, as pregnancy progressed and in the early post-birth period.   Nine maternal subjects (aged 28 to 40 years) were tested at less than 16 weeks, 24 weeks, 30 weeks, 38 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks postbirth. The subjects, fitted with 37 retroreflective markers, were filmed during upright sitting, quiet standing, and four trials each of maximum seated and standing trunk forward flexion, side to side flexion and during maximum seated axial rotation. Three trials each of constrained and free rising to stand from a height adjustable stool and with each foot placed on a forceplate were also recorded. An eight-camera motion analysis system was used to record movements of the body segments and synchronised force plate variables in three dimensions. Motion of the ankle, knee and hip joints, pelvic, thoracic and head segments and the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spines and shoulder joints were investigated. Twelve nulliparous subjects (aged 21 to 35 years) were used as controls to provide standard descriptive data and to investigate the consistency of the selected biomechanical variables with repeated testing. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to investigate the possibility of linear and quadratic trends showing systematic changes within the maternal group, over the four test sessions during pregnancy for each variable. Two tailed Student t-tests were used to compare the maternal postbirth variable results with the control group.  There was no significant effect of pregnancy on the upper body posture during upright sitting and quiet standing. Postbirth, the pelvic segment had a smaller anterior orientation and the thoracolumbar spine was less extended, indicating a flatter spinal curve.  The maternal subjects were similar to the control subjects in early pregnancy and postbirth for trunk segment motions during seated and standing forward flexion and side to side flexion and seated axial rotation. Strategies, such as increasing the width of the base of support and reducing obstruction to movements from other body parts, were used in late pregnancy in attempts to minimise the effects of increased trunk mass and circumference. For seated and standing side to side flexion, the strategies were successful and no significant decreases in range of motion were seen. For seated and standing forward flexion and seated axial rotation, motion of the thoracic segment and the thoracolumbar spine were significantly reduced, although movement of the pelvis was less affected.   In early pregnancy and postbirth the kinematics and kinetics of the lower limbs and upper body segment kinematics during constrained and free rising were generally similar to the control subjects. As pregnancy progressed there were increases in mass and dimensions of body segments. The effect of increased mass was seen in increased ground reaction forces and sagittal plane lower limb joint external moments. An increased base of support width was found in association with an increased lateral ground reaction force and ankle inversion moment from each foot, which would move the body centre of mass medially. There was little change in the three dimensional kinematics of the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spine, although the contribution of the upper body segments differed for each rise condition. There were also few significant changes in the displacement of the ankle, knee and hip, and the angular velocity of ankle and knee joints. The maternal subjects were thus able to flex the upper body forward, raise the body and maintain stability as pregnancy progressed, regardless of whether the rise to stand was performed in a natural manner or under constrained conditions. The overall results show that, contrary to expectations as pregnancy progressed, maternal subjects minimised propulsion rather than increasing it to overcome the increased mass and possibly limited trunk flexion. A fear of postural instability may have made the subjects more cautious and as they were able to adequately flex the trunk forward, propulsion was minimised in favour of maintaining upright terminal balance.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pregnancy;biomechanics;posture;sit to stand;spinal motion;kinematics;kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Pilot Survey to Assess the Vitamin A Status of Children Aged 6-72 months in the Ramu Region of Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Verma, Nitin</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea has been classified by the World Health Organisation as an area where clinical vitamin A deficiency (VAD) exists. This is at variance with the experience of the local physicians who do not encounter classical VAD in clinical practice.   This pilot study was carried out to resolve this contradiction, since many suggestions have been made to fortify foods with Vitamin A. If done in the absence of concrete data to back up this classification, it could take the focus away from the real problem as well as potentially create problems of Vitamin A toxicity. Therefore, answers from this study could have far reaching implications in a country such as PNG, which has high childhood mortality and limited financial and manpower resources.     The objective of this study was to determine the vitamin A status and identify risk factors of VAD in children aged 6 months to 6 years in a rural area of Papua New Guinea.     The survey was carried out in the Ramu region of Madang province. Households and children were randomly selected and standard questionnaires were used to collect information about diet, previous illnesses and night blindness. The weight and height of all children was recorded and an ocular and physical examination carried out by trained personnel. In addition, haemoglobin estimation and examination of blood films for malaria parasites was carried out in all the children.  In a randomly selected number of children, estimations of serum retinol and other micronutrient levels were carried out.  Results: A total of 609 children were enrolled in the study. Biochemical parameters were studied in 106 of them .The mean age of the children was 35 months. Possible night blindness was reported in 4 children. No xerophthalmia was seen. The prevalence of serum retinol levels ( 0.7 (mol/L (WHO suggested cut off values for subclinical VAD) was 10.3%. Anthropometric indicators indicated a high proportion of the children had stunting and wasting or both. Analysis of dietary patterns, maternal literacy, food availability and other surrogate indicators indicated that the population is at mild-moderate risk of developing VAD.  In conclusion, no evidence of clinical vitamin A deficiency was found. Subclinical vitamin A deficiency seemed to occur in this population at a level of mild-moderate public health importance. Further studies need to be carried out to assess the situation in different areas in PNG before policy decisions can be made with regards to mass vitamin A supplementation.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vitamin A;children;Papua New Guinea;vitamin A deficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogy and Parenting in English Drama, 1560-1610:  Flogging Schoolmasters and Cockering Mothers</field><field name="creator">Potter, Ursula Ann</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine the representation of parents and schoolmasters and the conflicts between them in vernacular drama in Reformation England.  This was a period of growth in public schooling and a time when numerous treatises on education and childrearing were in circulation in England.  Prevailing pedagogical theory privileged the schoolmaster's authority over that of the parents, and set paternal authority over that of the mother.  It sought to limit maternal power to the domestic sphere and the infant years, yet the drama examined here suggests that mothers, not fathers, were usually the parent in control of their children's education.  The conflicts inherent in these oppositions are played out in drama dealing with schooling and childrearing; each of the works examined here participates in and contributes to public debate over school education and parenting practices in early modern England.  The thesis conducts a close textual and contextual analysis of the representation of schoolmasters and parents and of parent-school relations in seven English plays.  A variety of dramatic genres is represented: public drama (Love's Labour's Lost, Patient Grissill, The Winter's Tale), school drama (Nice Wanton, July and Julian, The Disobedient Child), and private royal entertainment (The Lady of May).  The plays are explicated in terms of the Tudor school culture and the negotiation of authority between fathers, mothers and schoolmasters.  The thesis draws extensively on sixteenth-century school dialogues and vulgaria and on education treatises, which were available in English in Tudor England, in particular the writings of Erasmus, Vives, Ascham, Mulcaster, Elyot, Brinsley and Becon.  School records provide information on school conditions and curricula, the duties and qualities of schoolmasters and the role of schools in civic and public performances.  The thesis addresses issues of gender, childrearing, public education and parental and pedagogical authority in the second half of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedagogy;schooling;education;schoolmasters;humanism;childrearing;parenting;mothers;fathers;Shakespeare;Renaissance drama</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rotational Motion Artifact Correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</field><field name="creator">Weerasinghe, Arachchige Chaminda Perera</field><field name="description">The body motion of patients, during magnetic resonance (MR) imaging causes     significant artifacts in the reconstructed image. Artifacts are manifested as a motion induced blur and ghost repetitions of the moving structures. which obscure vital anatomical and pathological detail. The techniques that have been    proposed for suppressing motion artifacts fall into two major categories. Real-time techniques attempt to prevent the motion from corrupting the data by   restricting the data acquisition times or motion of the patients, whereas the    post-processing techniques use the information embedded in the corrupted data    to restore the image. Most methods currently in widespread use belong to the    real-time techniques, however with the advent of fast computing platforms and    sophisticated signal processing algorithms, the emergence of post-processing techniques is clearly evident.            The post-processing techniques usually demand an appropriate model of the      motion. The restoration of the image requires that the motion parameters be      determined in order to invert the data degradation process. Methods for the      correction of translational motion have been studied extensively in the past. The subject of this thesis encompasses the rotational motion model and the effect of rotational motion on the collected MR data in the spatial frequency space (k-space), which is in general, more complicated than the translational model.            Rotational motion artifacts are notably prevalent in MR images of head, brain and limbs. Post-processing techniques for the correction of rotational motion artifacts often involve interpolation and re-gridding of the acquired data in the k-space. These methods create significant data overlap and void regions. Therefore, in the past, proposed corrective techniques have been limited to suppression of artifacts caused by small angle rotations. This thesis presents a method of managing overlap regions, using weighted averaging of redundant data, in order to correct for large angle rotations. An iterative estimation technique for filling the data void regions has also been developed by the use of iterated application of projection operators onto constraint sets. These constraint sets are derived from the k-space data generated by the MR imager, and available a priori knowledge.             It is shown that the iterative algorithm diverges at times from the required image, due to inconsistency among the constraint sets. It is also shown that this can be overcome by using soft. constraint sets and fuzzy projections.            One of the constraints applied in the iterative algorithm is the finite support of the imaged object, marked by the outer boundary of the region of interest (ROI).      However, object boundary extraction directly from the motion affected MR image can be difficult, specially if the motion function of the object is unknown. This thesis presents a new ROI extraction scheme based on entropy minimization in the image background.            The object rotation function is usually unknown or unable to be measured with sufficient accuracy. The motion estimation algorithm proposed in this thesis is based on maximizing the similarity among the k-space data subjected to angular overlap. This method is different to the typically applied parameter estimation technique based on minimization of pixel energy outside the ROI, and has higher efficiency and ability to estimate rotational motion parameters in the midst of concurrent translational motion. The algorithms for ROI extraction, rotation estimation and data correction have been tested with both phantom images and spin echo MR images producing encouraging results.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging;MRI;POCS;fuzzy POCS;fuzzy sets;ROI;signal estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Radio Study of Selected Regions in the   Magellanic Clouds</field><field name="creator">Amy, Shaun Wallace</field><field name="description">The Magellanic Clouds have long provided a rich celestial laboratory for many   astrophysical research programmes.  Their location relatively close to the  Earth and away from the plane of our Galaxy has made them a natural target   for Southern Hemisphere ground-based instrumentation.  Likewise, the   continuing quest for images of the Clouds with higher dynamic range and   improved angular resolution has driven a continual improvement in   instrumentation across a range of wavelength bands.    The cornerstone of this thesis is a study of selected sources in the  Magellanic Clouds.  The sample was chosen from the 843MHz Molonglo   Observatory Synthesis Telescope survey of the Clouds, based on the existing  knowledge of each source, its flux density and angular extent.  This sample was   used to explore observational and analysis techniques with the Australia  Telescope Compact Array in order to better determine the nature of these   objects and to identify those sources worthy of further study.  This work  highlights many pertinent issues associated with the correct classification of  sources when only a limited amount of data is available.  These issues led  directly to the development of a more systematic approach in the   classification of the Large Magellanic Cloud source sample, detailed for the  first time in this thesis.     Two supernova remnants in the Small Magellanic Cloud were studied in detail.    The Australia Telescope images of 1E0102.2-7219 revealed, for the first   time, the radio structure of this young oxygen-rich supernova remnant, and   allowed a detailed comparison with existing optical and X-ray data to be  undertaken.  The comparisons presented in this thesis and in an earlier  publication have prompted exciting new X-ray observations at unprecedented  angular resolution.  The second, 0101-7226, studied as part of an   international collaboration, has a shell morphology at radio wavelengths   but no associated X-ray emission and is therefore something of an enigma.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radio Astronomy;Magellanic Clouds;Aperture Synthesis Imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Studies on Plasma Vitamin D Binding Protein</field><field name="creator">LAING, CHRISTOPHER JAMES</field><field name="description">The plasma vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is an a-glycoprotein, synthesised and secreted by the liver, which binds specifically vitamin D and its metabolites. The DBP molecule, has a single high affinity binding site for its ligands, and is present in blood in concentrations about 1000-fold greater than the sum of all its vitamin D ligands. Previous studies have not found any change in the concentration of DBP related to various derangements in mineral homeostasis. Therefore the general view is that DBP has a passive role in the physiology of vitamin D and its metabolites, and simply acts to solubilise and transport these hydrophobic ligands in the aqueous extracellular fluid. However, differences which have been described in its affinity for various vitamin D metabolites suggest that there have been evolutionary influences on the properties of this protein. Furthermore, plasma DBP concentration has been found to change in response to a number of physiological factors, such as changing sex steroid hormone secretion. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis was to investigate variation in the plasma concentration of the DBP in a range of vertebrate species, and in response to a variety of physiological factors. The results  suggest that DBP may have an active role in regulating the bioavailability, and hence the utilisation and metabolism of its ligands.     DBP concentration has traditionally been measured using immunological techniques. These techniques, although fast and simple, have a number of draw-backs which can be overcome by the use of assays which rely upon functional aspects of the DBP. A saturation binding assay was modified from those described previously. Using this technique, it was found that both the circulating concentration of the DBP and its affinity for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) varied significantly among a wide range of species of reptiles and birds. This variation did not reflect phylogenetic relationships among the study species, suggesting that the variation was more likely to be the result of selective pressure in response to individual ecological or physiological circumstance, rather than to random mutation. In support of this, both the plasma concentration of DBP, and its affinity for 25(OH)D3 were significantly associated with a number of ecological factors which might be considered to have some significance to vitamin D and calcium homeostasis. In addition, comparative binding data suggests that the ability of the DBP to bind 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 with equal affinity to 25(OH)D3 is an evolutionary innovation of mammalian vertebrates. In order to extend the idea of genetic variation in the concentration and affinity of plasma DBP, two strains of broiler (meat-type) chickens were studied. It was found that both the concentration and the affinity of plasma DBP for 25(OH)D3 was characteristic for each strain, emphasising the sensitivity of DBP to genetic variation.     A number of factors have been found to modulate the genetically determined plasma concentration of DBP. Deficiencies of dietary protein and dietary energy, and variation in concentrations of sex steroids were found to affect the circulating concentration of DBP. However, species differences were still apparent, suggesting that the sensitivity of DBP to these physiological modifiers may have developed independently in different species, and may be secondary to genetic determinants of DBP properties.    The plasma DBP concentration and specific binding affinity both determine the availability of its ligands for cellular uptake. It is likely that this process is complex, and involves a combination of protein mediated and non-mediated uptake events. This makes DBP a potentially important determinant of the biological actions of its ligands. The studies in this thesis have produced two main lines of argument supporting an active role for DBP in the regulation of vitamin D metabolism and utilisation. The first is that genetic variation in the properties of plasma DBP appears to be genetically determined, and is selected for, both at the between-species, and the within-species level, than it is to random mutation. Secondly, the ability of physiological and environmental factors to modify the circulating concentration of DBP suggests that this protein is responsive to homeostatic processes. It is proposed that DBP is an active regulator of the physiological economy of vitamin D and its metabolites by being itself regulated by a number of genetic and non-genetic factors.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vitamin D binding protein;DBP;vitamin D;cholecalciferol</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lena Ashwell 1869-1957: Actress, Patriot, Pioneer</field><field name="creator">Leask, Margaret Eileen</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT    A detailed account of the working life and achievements of the English actress/manager, Lena Ashwell, between the years 1891 and 1929, set in the context of the theatrical and social environment of these four decades. The thesis presents a chronological record of Ashwell's stage career, her development as a theatrical manager and her contributions to progress in her profession as well as to the changing perception of the role of women in society. It also records Ashwell's contribution during the First World War, taking entertainment to the war zones to boost the morale of soldiers and to provide employment for actors and musicians. It continues with an account of the post-war pursuit of her aim of making theatre accessible to the whole community through dedicated commitment to the British Drama League and the idea of a National Theatre and the creation and management of the Lena Ashwell Players.     The thesis proposes that Ashwell has been unjustly neglected in histories of this period and that her considerable achievements are worthy of recognition and inclusion in accounts not only of the acting profession and the achievements of women playwrights, but also of the Suffrage and women's movement, the First World War, the National Theatre of Great Britain and the municipal or regional theatres established throughout the country, state subsidy and public support for the arts, actor training and the study of drama and theatre within the education system.    Five chapters give a narrative account of Ashwell's work from her first stage appearance in March 1891 to the closure of the Lena Ashwell Players in August 1929. Each chapter adds to the cumulative impact of Ashwell's achievements, while identifying areas where she has left a lasting legacy. The Postscript provides a brief account of the last twenty-seven years of her long life, when she was less able to play an active role in society, but never lost her indomitable spirit or ambition for a better world. The Appendices provide a chronological list of her stage appearances and details of the members of the Lena Ashwell Players and the company's repertoire during the 1920s.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theatre;theatre in education;community theatre;actress;theatre manager</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participant music listening behaviours in interactive multimedia music instruction</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Michael Brooke</field><field name="description">While emerging technologies such as interactive multimedia are increasingly being employed in computerised music instruction, understanding of participant music listening behaviours in interactive multimedia music instruction is currently very limited. With the aim of elucidating music listening behaviour, the central concern of this work is to identify and explain participant interactions with the audio components of interactive multimedia music instruction. The investigation employs a novel documentation procedure, which extends the application of digital audio recording technology, to provide a finely calibrated analysis of the audio activity of a sample of 20 undergraduate music education majors during individual sessions with two commercially-available interactive multimedia music instruction programs. Graphically-based Sound Activity Profiles, which the researcher developed specifically for the current investigation, characterise and summarise participant interactions with audio components, while an analysis of questionnaire responses and follow-up interview transcripts provides supplementary information that further explains participants' music listening behaviours.  The results of the investigation show that music listening behaviours during the study sessions were highly variable. While extensive participant interaction with music examples occasionally reflected attentive music listening behaviours, many study sessions were characterised by brief, fragmentary music excerpts and lengthy periods of silence. Participants spent as little as five percent of their session time listening to music and as much as 88 percent of the session time in silence. A substantial number of the study cohort frequently interrupted the music examples they had activated. Participants' perceptions of the extent of their interaction with music examples were frequently  inaccurate, as subjects often substantially overestimated the amount of session time they had spent listening to music. The study findings suggest that many interactive multimedia music instruction participants would benefit from interventions that elicit more extensive and prolonged interaction with music examples. Accordingly, recommendations include a call for research to develop and test software designs that incorporate automated monitoring of session audio activity so that dynamic on-screen information about music listening behaviour can be provided to interactive multimedia music instruction participants. Such information may encourage participants to modify inappropriate music listening behaviours.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music;listening;behaviours;interactive;multimedia;instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic Applications of Interactive Computational Methods</field><field name="creator">LI, MIN</field><field name="description">Effective interactive computing methods are needed in a number of specific areas of geophysical interpretation, even though the basic algorithms have been established. One approach to raise the quality of interpretation is to promote better interaction between human and the computer. The thesis is concerned with improving this dialog in three areas: automatic event picking, data visualization and sparse data imaging.     Fully automatic seismic event picking methods work well in relatively good conditions. They collapse when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the structure of the subsurface is complex. The interactive seismic event picking system described here blends the interpreter's guidance and judgment into the computer program, as it can bring the user into the loop to make subjective decisions when the picking problem is complicated. Several interactive approaches for 2-D event picking and 3-D horizon tracking have been developed. Envelope (or amplitude) threshold detection for first break picking is based on the assumption that the power of the signal is larger than that of the noise. Correlation and instantaneous phase pickers are designed for and better suited to picking other arrivals. The former is based on the cross-correlation function, and a model trace (or model traces) selected by the interpreter is needed. The instantaneous phase picker is designed to track spatial variations in the instantaneous phase of the analytic form of the arrival. The picking options implemented into the software package SeisWin were tested on real data drawn from many sources, such as full waveform sonic borehole logs, seismic reflection surveys and borehole radar profiles, as well as seven of the most recent 3-D seismic surveys conducted over Australian coal mines. The results show that the interactive picking system in SeisWin is efficient and tolerant. The 3-D horizon tracking method developed especially attracts industrial users.     The visualization of data is also a part of the study, as picking accuracy, and indeed the whole of seismic interpretation depends largely on the quality of the final display. The display is often the only window through which an interpreter can see the earth's substructures. Display is a non-linear operation. Adjustments made to meet display deficiencies such as automatic gain control (AGC) have an important and yet ill-documented effect on the performance of pattern recognition operators, both human and computational. AGC is usually implemented in one dimension. Some of the tools in wide spread use for two dimensional image processing which are of great value in the local gain control of conventional seismic sections such as edge detectors, histogram equalisers, high-pass filters, shaded relief are discussed. Examples are presented to show the relative effectiveness of various display options.    Conventional migration requires dense arrays with uniform coverage and uniform illumination of targets. There are, however, many instances in which these ideals can not be approached. Event migration and common tangent plane stacking procedures were developed especially for sparse data sets as a part of the research effort underlying this thesis. Picked-event migration migrates the line between any two points on different traces on the time section to the base map. The interplay between the space and time domain gives the interpreter an immediate view of mapping. Tangent plane migration maps the reflector by accumulating the energy from any two possible reflecting points along the common tangent lines on the space plane. These methods have been applied to both seismic and borehole-radar data and satisfactory results have been achieved.</field><field name="date">1111</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">event picking;horizon tracking;image;sparse data</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social and Psychological Adjustments of First Generation Polish Immigrants to Australia</field><field name="creator">Jancz, Marek Waclaw</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research was to find predictors of psycho-social adjustment of Polish immigrants to Sydney, Australia. There were two sets of independent variables considered: i) personal characteristics, including: intelligence, extraversion, neuroticism, style of attribution and self-acceptance and  ii) demographic information, consisted of: age, gender, length of residence, marital status, number of children, educational level, yearly income, immigration status (dependent vs. independent immigration) and residential status.      The dependent variables were social (adaptation and assimilation) and psychological adjustment. The hypotheses tested in the study were that each of these personal and demographic characteristics would be associated with adaptation and/or assimilation, and psychological well-being.       The two samples (both studies) were composed of more than 200 first generation Polish immigrants who arrived in Australia after 1980. No significant gender differences were found. The internal consistency and principal components structure of Adaptation and Assimilation were examined, and the measures were refined. There were employed standard measurements (i.e. GHQ, BDI, BAI, EPI, ASQ, Raven Matrices and WAIS-Vocabulary) and newly developed measures (i.e. the Social Adjustment Scale and the Self-Acceptance Questionnaire).       The general results suggested that psycho-social adjustment was best predicted by three pre-arrival characteristics (extraversion, education and self-acceptance), and post-arrival employment status and length of residence. There were, however, some differences in regard to the particular aspects of psycho-social adjustment. Better adaptation was meaningfully related to employment (income) and education in Study 1, and self-acceptance, employment and extraversion in Study 2; better assimilation seemed to be significantly predicted by education, age of arrival and length of residence (Study 1), and self-acceptance, extraversion, education and age of arrival (Study 2). Psychological [mal]adjustment was best indicated by globality and stability in attributing negative events (Study 1), lower self-acceptance and lack of employment status (Study 2).</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigration-Adjustments-Heath</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behavioural and neural effects of cannabinoids:  Studies using Lewis and Wistar strain rats</field><field name="creator">Arnold, Jonathon Carl</field><field name="description">Cannabis (known in its common forms as Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica) is the most widely used illicit drug in the world and has been used for thousands of years for medicinal, religious and hedonistic purposes.  In the last half of the 20th century the therapeutic uses of cannabis were largely ignored as most Western governments prohibited the use of the drug.  Prohibition has come about largely as a result of the view that cannabis is a dangerous drug that poses major risks to both mental and physical health.  However, this view is being increasingly challenged in recent years with a major popular movement towards decriminalization of cannabis occurring in some Western countries and a resurgence of interest in the medicinal properties of cannabis.   Since Mechoulam and colleagues first isolated delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) as the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, considerable advances have been made in the pharmacology of cannabis and cannabis-like drugs (cannabinoids).  Central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors have been isolated and two endogenous ligands have been discovered.  In addition, two cannabinoid receptor antagonists have been developed.  However, our knowledge of the behavioural, neural and emotional effects of cannabis and the cannabinoids has often lagged behind our understanding of basic cannabinoid pharmacology.   The present thesis attempts to further the understanding of the behavioural, neural and emotional effects of cannabinoids, using laboratory rats as subjects.  A synthetic analogue of delta 9-THC (CP 55,940), is used as the primary pharmacological tool.  The thesis offers a broad perspective with three major areas of investigation.  These are:  1) the effects of CP 55,940 on anxiety-related behaviour (Chapters 2 and 3);  2) the effects of CP 55,940 on patterns of brain activation as indicated by c-fos expression (Chapter 4) and;  3) the addictive potential of CP 55,940 and its capacity to produce sensitization to the effects of other drugs such as cocaine (Chapters 5 and 6).  A recurring theme throughout the thesis is that genetic factors may partially determine the behavioural, neural and emotional response to cannabinoids.  To this end, the thesis compares Lewis and Wistar trains of rat in a wide variety of assays.  Previous research has isolated Lewis rats as an "addiction-prone" and a "cannabinoid-preferring" strain, as they are more sensitive to the rewarding effects of various drugs of abuse including cannabinoids.  Conversely, cannabinoids appear to have aversive effects in Wistar rats.  A long-standing puzzle in cannabinoid research has been the question of why rats do not self-administer cannabis or cannabinoids.  One likely reason is that cannabinoids have predominately aversive effects in rats.  It is proposed here that these aversive effects arise because cannabinoids are anxiogenic agents in most rat strains.  However some evidence indicates that the Lewis strain of rat are the only strain to find cannabinoids rewarding.  It is hypothesised that Lewis rats may be more susceptible to the rewarding effects of cannabinoids because they are less susceptible to the anxiogenic effects of these compounds.    In Chapters 2 and 3 the anxiogenic effects of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 were compared in Lewis and Wistar rats in several different animal models of anxiety.  In Chapter 2, the predatory odour avoidance, open area avoidance and conditioned ultrasonic vocalization (USV) models were utilised.  In the predatory odour avoidance model, rats were exposed to cat odour in a rectangular arena and given the opportunity to hide in a small box.  Both Lewis and Wistar rats displayed high levels of hiding during odour exposure.  In Wistar but not Lewis rats, 50 &#65533;g/kg of CP 55,940 (i.p.) enhanced this avoidance response.  Unfortunately, Lewis rats showed exceptionally high avoidance of the cat odour making it difficult to discern the effects of CP 55,940.  To avoid this problem a second experiment was conducted, where rats were tested in the same arena as in the first experiment but with no cat odour present.  Again in Wistar, but not Lewis rats, 25 and 50 &#65533;g/kg of CP 55,940 (i.p.) increased the avoidance of the open space.  In the third experiment, Lewis and Wistar rats were placed in a chamber in which they had previously received footshock.  Wistar but not Lewis rats re-exposed under the influence of 10, 25 or 50 &#65533;g/kg CP 55,940 (i.p.) emitted significantly more USVs than vehicle-treated rats.  Thus, CP 55,940 clearly increased anxiety-related behaviour in Wistar rats but not Lewis rats, supporting the notion of a genetic predisposition towards cannabinoid-induced anxiety.    In Chapter 3 the generality of the findings made in Chapter 2 were tested by utilising two further animal models of anxiety, the social interaction and light-dark emergence tests.  From the results of Chapter 2, it could be claimed that Lewis rats were merely subsensitive to the effects of CP 55,940.  Therefore a higher dose range (0, 25, 50 and 75 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) of CP 55,940 was employed in Chapter 3.  In addition, the rotarod test was used to assess whether CP 55,940 has ataxic effects at these doses.  In the first experiment, two unfamiliar rats were placed in a large arena and the time the rats spent socially interacting was recorded.  CP 55,940 significantly reduced the total time rats spent socially interacting in Lewis (25 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) and Wistar rats (50 and 75 &#65533;g/kg).  However, CP 55,940 has a significantly greater effect in Wistar rats compared to Lewis rats.  In the second experiment, rats were placed in a small box within a large open arena and the latency to emerge from this box was measured.  CP 55,940 increased emergence latency (at 75 &#65533;g/kg) and mean time per entry into the box (at 25 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) in Wistar but not Lewis rats.  Furthermore, CP 55,940 caused a greater decrease in time spent in the open arena (at 25 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) and frequency of emergence (at 75 &#65533;g/kg) in Wistar rats in comparison to Lewis rats.  In the third experiment, CP 55,940 (at 25, 50 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) caused mild incoordination only in Lewis rats as measured by the rotarod test.  This finding argues against the assertion that the CP 55,940-induced anxiety-like behaviours in Wistar rats are merely a result of motoric impairment.  Furthermore, it illustrates that Lewis rats are not generally subsensitive to the effects of CP 55,940.  That is, when compared to other rat strains, Lewis rats may be more or less sensitive to the effects of CP 55,940 depending on what behaviour is being assessed.  From the results of Chapters 2 and 3 it can be seen that Lewis rats are less sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of CP 55,940 than Wistar rats.  In Chapter 4 it was hypothesised that in Lewis rats the effects of CP 55,940 on neural substrates of reward far outweigh the effects the compound has on neural substrates mediating anxiety.  To examine this issue, the effects of CP 55,940 at a moderate (50 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) and high (250 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) dose were observed on c-fos expression (a measure of neural activation) and behaviour in Lewis and Wistar rats.  CP 55,940 dose-dependently inhibited locomotor activity and reduced body temperature with Lewis rats being significantly less affected than Wistar rats.  The 250 &#65533;g/kg dose caused significant catalepsy in both strains with a significantly greater effect in Wistar rats.  These strain differences in the effects of CP 55,940 on body temperature and motor behaviour clearly correlated with c-fos expression in various regions and subregions.  In general, Lewis rats showed significantly less Fos-labeled cells in comparison to Wistar rats.  These strain differences in the effects of CP 55,940 on c-fos expression appeared unique to cannabinoids, as cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p.) had equivalent effects on c-fos expression in Lewis and Wistar rats.    CP 55,940 promoted c-fos expression in areas not previously assessed, such as the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AH), islands of Calleja (ICjM), periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg).  The strain differences uncovered in Chapters 2 and 3 correlated well with strain differences in the effects of CP 55,940 on c-fos expression in areas implicated in cannabinoid-induced anxiety, such as the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and PAG.  However, the effects of CP 55,940 on c-fos expression in a neural circuit which may underlie reward, which includes the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAS) and PPTg, were also less in Lewis rats in comparison to Wistar rats.  Future investigations must address whether the reduced effects of CP 55,940 on the Lewis rat are due to pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.  In addition, future studies must reconcile the pattern of c-fos expression observed here with prior reports of the Lewis rat being a unique "cannabinoid-preferring" strain.  In Chapter 4, CP 55,940 administration promoted c-fos expression in areas of the brain thought to play a critical role in behavioural sensitization such as the ventral tegmental area and NAS.  This is interesting because it is possible that c-fos is involved in promoting neuroadaptations that underlie drug addiction.  To examine this idea, Chapter 5 investigated a behavioural assay of the long-term neural adaptations that may occur with the chronic administration of cannabis, namely, behavioural sensitization.  This chapter also examined an animal model of the "gateway hypothesis", that is, the hypothesis that prior exposure to cannabis increases an individuals vulnerability to using other drugs.  This animal model is known as cross-sensitization.  First it was shown that Lewis, but not Wistar rats, given cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p.) every second day over a two week period displayed a progressively greater locomotor response to the drug over days indicating behavioural sensitization.  When CP 55,940 (0, 10, 25 or 50 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) was administered under a similar regime, no such sensitization was observed in either strain.  Rather, the two highest doses of CP 55,940 (25 and 50 &#65533;g/kg) caused locomotor suppression that lasted throughout administration.  When Lewis or Wistar rats pre-exposed ten times to CP 55,940 were challenged with cocaine (15 mg/kg), no exaggerated locomotor response to cocaine was evident relative to non pre-exposed rats. When these rats were subsequently re-tested with CP 55,940, it continued to produce a dose-dependent suppression of locomotor activity.  Finally, when CP 55,940 (50 &#65533;g/kg) was co-administered with cocaine in Lewis rats, it significantly reduced the locomotor hyperactivity produced by the drug but did not block the development of behavioural sensitization to cocaine.  These results show that CP 55,940 does not sensitize locomotor activity with repeated administration in the same way as cocaine, and that pre-exposure or concurrent exposure to CP 55,940 does not enhance sensitivity to the subsequent behavioural effects of cocaine.  Therefore, unlike Chapters 2, 3 and 4 where strain differences were observed in CP 55,940?induced anxiety, hypothermia, catalepsy, c-fos expression and ataxia, there were no strain differences with respect to behavioural sensitization.    Landmark studies by Gardner and colleagues showed that Lewis rats are particularly susceptible, in comparison to other rat strains, to the rewarding effects of delta 9-THC on: 1) medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation behaviour and; 2) dopamine (DA) efflux in the NAS.  However, in Chapter 4 Lewis rats were less susceptible than Wistar rats to CP 55,940-induced c-fos expression in the NAS.  Further, Lewis rats showed no behavioural sensitization to the chronic administration of CP 55,940.  In light of these findings, Chapter 6 assessed whether CP 55,940 does have a rewarding effect on MFB self-stimulation behaviour in Lewis rats.  Lewis rats were trained to self-stimulate the MFB using a rate?frequency paradigm and then administered CP 55,940 (0, 10, 25 and 50 &#65533;g/kg i.p.).  CP 55,940 had no effect on MFB self-stimulation behaviour as assessed by the M50, the stimulation frequency at which half-maximal response rates were obtained.  This result calls into question previous assertions that Lewis rats are a "cannabis-preferring" strain of rat.   Previous studies utilising the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, SR 141716, have shown that the endogenous cannabinoid system may have some involvement in the rewarding effects of cocaine, morphine, sucrose and alcohol.  Thus, Chapter 6 also assessed the effects of SR 141716 (0, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) on MFB stimulation in Lewis rats.  The role of DA in MFB stimulation reward has already been established, so for comparison purposes the effects of the DA D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.06 mg/kg i.p.) was also assessed.  Only a very high dose of SR 141716 (20 mg/kg) caused a significant inhibition of the rewarding efficacy of the stimulation with all other doses (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) being ineffective in modulating the rewarding impact of brain stimulation.  This was seen as an increase in M50.  By comparison, a relatively low dose (0.06 mg/kg) of SCH 23390 caused a large increase in M50. These results indicate a relatively modest influence of the endogenous cannabinoid system on reward-relevant neurotransmission in the self-stimulation paradigm.   Chapter 7 concludes the thesis and discusses the implications of the results obtained.  The main findings of the current thesis are: 1) that the suggested "addiction-prone" Lewis strain of rat is less susceptible to cannabinoid-induced anxiety in comparison to Wistar rats; 2) Lewis rats show less cannabinoid-induced c-fos expression in comparison to Wistar rats (including in brain regions implicated in cannabinoid-induced anxiety and reward); 3) cannabinoid-induced c-fos expression exists in a number of brain regions never previously assessed such as the MPO, ICjM and PPTg; 4) behavioural sensitization does not occur with the repeated administration of CP 55,940; 5) cannabinoid pre-exposure or co-administration does not increase the sensitivity of the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine; 6) the endogenous cannabinoid system, at most, only has a minor influence on the neural substrate of brain stimulation reward and; 7) that there are previously unreported strain differences in cannabinoid-induced hypothermia, catalepsy and ataxia.  These results add to our understanding of the effects of the behavioural, emotional and neural effects of cannabinoids and the endogenous cannabinoid system.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CP 55;940;cannabinoids;rats;behaviour;neuroscience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that affect the delivery of diabetes care.</field><field name="creator">Overland, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Diabetes is emerging as a major threat to health, with global economic and social implications.  Recent research has shown that the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes can be reduced by timely and effective treatment. However, unless people with diabetes have access to this treatment, the impact of diabetes will continue to rise.   This thesis therefore explores the current standards of care which people with diabetes receive. It also looks at factors likely to impact on delivery of diabetes care.  Studies were conducted at two levels.  In the studies described in Chapters 2 and 3, general data applicable to all or nearly all patients with diabetes were collected.  This approach substantially eliminates selection bias but precludes the ability to examine clinical outcomes.  In the other studies, detailed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, specific aspects of diabetes care pertaining to more select groups of diabetic subjects were examined.  This approach allows clinical parameters to be examined in more detail but is more subject to selection bias.  It is hoped that the combination of these two approaches provides a more balanced view of the topic under examination.      In Australia, the Medicare Program, a single government controlled universal health insurance fund, provides access to medical services for all residents.  Medicare occasions of service data therefore represent the most comprehensive source of information regarding health service utilisation in Australia.  The data does not account for people receiving diabetes care through public hospital based services.  However, a survey of public hospitals within NSW (n=198), described in Chapter 2, showed that the number of individuals in this category is relatively small and represents only 5.2% of the diabetic population.     Using Medicare item codes, and with the permission and assistance of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, data were extracted on attendance to medical practitioners and utilisation of diabetes related procedures for people living in New South Wales (NSW) for the individual years between 1993 to 1997.  All data were stratified by the presence of diabetes, gender and age group.  Individuals were deemed to have diabetes if an HbA1c, which can only be ordered for a person with known diabetes, had been performed over the 5-year period and the sample size adjusted for the incidence of diabetes.  Once adjusted, the number of people with diabetes in NSW for the individual years 1993 to 1997 were 143,920, 156,234, 168,216, 177,280 and 185,780.  Comparison with 1996 census data confirmed a 91.7% capture of the total NSW population (5,495,900/5,995,545 individuals).    The data were retrieved for NSW as a whole and for individual postcodes.  Postcodes were then classified by population density as either major urban, urban or rural. On average over the study period, persons with diabetes accounted for 3.1% of the population but they used 5.5% of general practitioner services.  As seen in Chapter 2, a large proportion of people with diabetes were also under the care of specialists and consultant physicians, up to 51.2% and 41.8% respectively, a 3 to 4 fold increase when compared with their non-diabetic counterparts.  In regard to geographical location, once adjusted for age and gender, the odds ratio of attending a specialist was only slightly higher for people with diabetes living in areas of high population density when compared to people with diabetes living in rural areas.  This ratio reached as high as 1.85 in regard to attendance to consultant physicians (Chapter 3).  The odds ratio for the non-diabetic population was similar indicating that the difference in access to consultant physicians was not disease specific.     Analysis of results showed that despite the increase in service utilisation, large proportions of people with diabetes were not routinely monitored in regard to diabetes and its complications across the State.  By 1997, HbA1c was still not performed in over 40% of people with diabetes each year and only 11.6% of the diabetic population had undergone microalbuminuria estimation.  Interestingly, the differences in levels of monitoring between rural and urban areas were surprisingly small.  Monitoring of diabetes and its complications did improve in all parts of the State over the study period.  However, the greatest improvement was seen in rural areas, despite rural patients having fewer attendances to general practitioners and fewer patients attending specialist care.    In the face of finite resources and the rising prevalence of diabetes, an increasing number of patients will need to rely on general practitioners to provide diabetes care regardless of where they live.  A 'shared care' approach which encourages and supports general practitioners to manage patients with diabetes, while giving them access to specialist services for those patients that require them, is increasingly being advocated as a way of maximising efficacy while minimising costs.  Yet if health care professionals leave undone what they think is done by others, shared care can become neglected care.  Chapter 4 reports a detailed audit of 200 randomly selected shared care patients who were assessed on two or more occasions.  This study showed that the majority of specialist treatment recommendations are implemented by general practitioners.  Doctors formally registered with the Diabetes Shared Care Programme and those who write longer referral letters were more likely to implement recommendations than their counterparts.  Moreover, the average HbA1c and the complication profile of these patients were similar to those found in various studies around the world.  This suggests that diabetes can be well managed by a shared care approach that is adequately integrated.      To overcome the problem that data is lacking on those patients that did not return for specialist review, a further 200 shared care patients who were lost to follow up from the shared care system were traced.  Information regarding whether treatment recommendations had been implemented was sought from both the referring doctor and the patient.  Overall, information on 182 of the 200 patients could be obtained.  As discussed in Chapter 5, comparison of the returned and non returned patients' demographic and clinical profiles at time of their initial specialist review showed that general practitioners differentiated between the 'more complicated' patients, choosing to re-refer those with macrovascular disease, while maintaining the care of 'less complicated' patients. Re-referral for specialist review was also dependent on the patient remaining under the care of their original doctor.   Encouragingly, general practitioners seemed to take a more active role in the non-returned group.  They included more details regarding type and duration of diabetes in the referral letters of patients who were not re-referred for specialist review.  They also implemented more treatment recommendations in the non-returned group, with the difference in implementation rate for metabolic recommendations reaching statistical significance.  This study also showed that movement of patients between doctors raises concern regarding continuity of care.    The multi-factorial nature of diabetes means that best practice is not easily accommodated within a single appointment.  Thus continuity of care becomes an important issue.  To assess the current status, 479 consecutive patients referred to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Diabetes Centre in a 6-month period were recruited and underwent a detailed clinical assessment.  They were also questioned regarding the number of general practitioners they attended and the length of time they had been under the care of the referring doctor.   The results outlined in Chapter 6 showed that the majority of people with diabetes (87.7%) attended only one general practitioner and had been under the care of that doctor medium to long term.  Younger patients, who were relatively healthy apart from the presence of diabetes, were more likely to attend several general practitioners or have changed their general practitioner within the last year.  This lack of continuity had little difference on acute outcomes such as glycaemic and blood pressure control.  Appropriately, continuity of care increased with increasing age and the increasing prevalence of diabetes complications, mainly macrovascular disease.    These studies indicate that further efforts are required to improve the overall standard of diabetes care within Australia.  At present there is a heavy dependency on specialist services.  As the population ages and the number of people with diabetes increases, much of this burden will fall on general practitioners, as is already evident in rural areas.  When provided with appropriate support and infrastructure, general practitioners are able to maintain standards of care through referral of patients with more complex medical problems and by maintaining the degree of continuity appropriate to the patient's needs.  However, the collection of relevant information to monitor future trends in diabetes services provision is important.  As shown in this thesis, Medicare data represents an easy and cost effective method with which to do so.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes;standard of care;shared care;continuity of care;service utilisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising and Mapping Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERVs)</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jun Heon</field><field name="description">The initial focus of this PhD project was on comparative gene mapping. Comparative gene mapping is facilitated by consensus PCR primers which amplify homologous gene fragments in many species. As a part of an international co-ordinated programme of comparative mapping in pigs, 47 CATS (Comparative Anchor Tagged Sequence) consensus primer pairs for loci located on human chromosomes 9, 10, 20, and 22, were used for amplifying homologous loci in pigs. After optimization of PCR conditions, 23 CATS products have confirmed by comparison with homologous sequences in GenBank. A French somatic cell hybrid panel was used to physically map the 6 porcine CATS products distinguishable from rodent background product, namely ADRA1A, ADRA2A, ARSA, GNAS1, OXT and TOP1. Of these, the map location of ADRA1A and OXT showed inconsistency with the previously recognised conserved relationship between human and pig. The other four loci mapped to positions consistent with known syntenic relationships. Despite low levels of polymorphism, frequently indistinguishable rodent and porcine products in somatic hybrids and some confusion of identity of gene family members, these CATS primers have made a useful contribution to the porcine-human comparative map.  The focus of the project then changed to genetic and molecular characterisation of endogenous retroviruses in pigs and their relatives. Pigs are regarded as a potentially good source of organs and tissues for transplantation into humans. However, porcine endogenous retroviruses have emerged as a possible problem as they can infect cultured human cells. Two main types of pig retrovirus, determined by envelope protein, PERV-A and PERV-B, are widely distributed in different pig breeds and a third less common type, PERV-C, has also been recognised. Endogenous retroviruses were analyzed from the Westran (Westmead transplantation) inbred line of pig, specially bred for biomedical research. Thirty-one 1.8 kb env PCR product clones were sequenced after preliminary screening with the restriction enzymes KpnI and MboI. Five recombinant clones between A and B were identified. 55% of clones (17/31) sequenced had stop codons within the envelope protein-encoding region, which would prevent the retrovirus from making full-length envelope protein recognizable by cell-surface receptors of the virus. The endogenous viruses were physically mapped in Westran pigs by FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation) using PERV-A and PERV-B envelope clones as probes. Preliminary FISH data suggest that there are at least 22 PERVs (13 PERV-A and 9 PERV-B) and the chromosomal locations of these in the Westran strain are quite different from European Large White pigs. The sequences and mapping results of inbred Westran pig suggest that there are relatively few PERV integration sites compared with commercial pigs and further that a large proportion of clones are defective due to premature stop codons in the envelope gene.   To investigate the relationship of endogenous retroviruses in peccaries and pigs, a set of degenerate primers was used to amplify peccary retroviral sequences. The sequences of two putative retroviral clones showed close homology, albeit with a 534 bp deletion, to mouse and pig retroviral sequences. Also, four non-target sequences were amplified from peccary with the degenerate retroviral primers. They are a part of the peccary cofilin gene, a SINE, and a sequence containing a microsatellite. The peccary endogenous retroviral sequences are significant in that they are the first such sequences reported in peccary species and repudiate old claims in the literature that peccaries do not have C-type retroviral sequences.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PERVs (Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses);Pig;CATS (Comparative Anchor Tagged Sequences);Gene Mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in Multi dimensional Signal Demodulation</field><field name="creator">Larkin, Kieran Gerard</field><field name="description">Problems in the demodulation of one, two, and three-dimensional signals are investigated. In one-dimensional linear systems the analytic signal and the Hilbert transform are central to the understanding of both modulation and demodulation. However, it is shown that an efficient nonlinear algorithm exists which is not explicable purely in terms of an approximation to the Hilbert transform. The algorithm is applied to the problem of finding the envelope peak of a white light interferogram. The accuracy of peak location is then shown to compare favourably with conventional, but less efficient, techniques. In two dimensions (2-D) the intensity of a wavefield yields to a phase demodulation technique equivalent to direct phase retrieval. The special symmetry of a Helmholtz wavefield allows a unique inversion of an autocorrelation. More generally, a 2-D (non-Helmholtz) fringe pattern can be demodulated by an isotropic 2-D extension of the Hilbert transform that uses a spiral phase signum function. The range of validity of the new transform is established using the asymptotic method of stationary phase. Simulations of the algorithm confirm that deviations from the ideal occur where the fringe pattern curvature is larger than the fringe frequency. A new self-calibrating algorithm for arbitrary sequences of phase-shifted interferograms is developed using the aforementioned spiral phase transform. The algorithm is shown to work even with discontinuous fringe patterns, which are known to seriously hamper other methods. Initial simulations of the algorithm indicate an accuracy of 5 milliradians is achievable. Previously undocumented connections between the demodulation techniques are uncovered and discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal processing;image processing;demodulation;multi-dimensional signals;Hilbert transform</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the association between toxin producing staphylococcus, biochemical changes and jaw muscle pain.</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Neil Roland</field><field name="description">Objectives: To assess the expression of the symptoms of jaw muscle pain and its association with alterations in biochemistry, other symptoms and the carriage of staphylococci.  Methods: Three different study populations were assessed.  The first was selected and examined by the author and consisted of 43 pain and 41 age and sex matched controls.  The second was a study of CFS patients who were blinded to the author and the author subsequently examined the associations between jaw muscle symptom reporting and the standardised biochemistry measures.  The third study was also blinded to the author but included an investigation of staphylococci and certain cytokine and biochemistry measures.    Results: The three studies clearly establish an association between the carriage of toxicogenic coagulase negative staphylococci and the expression of jaw muscle pain in both males and females.  These associations were homogeneous and were found whether the patients were selected on the basis of having jaw muscle pain or selected from within a population of patients selected on the basis of having Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  The studies associated the changes with variations in biochemistry and these were in turn associated with symptom expression within the jaw muscle pain patients.  These biochemical alterations included the dysregulation of immune cell counts, cytokines, electrolyte and protein metabolism.  These symptoms and biochemical changes were associated with pain severity and illness duration and staphylococcal toxin production.  From the data a model was developed which shows the mechanisms involved in the development of chronic pain in the jaw muscles.

The aim of the thesis was to investigate the  distribution and factors influencing allergens of Alternaria in the air. As airborne  allergenic spores were thought to arise from harvesting of nearby crops, two towns with  different agricultural practices were studied. Moree has two crop harvesting periods in  summer and autumn whilst Wagga Wagga has one harvesting period in summer.  Over two years, air was sampled daily in Wagga Wagga and Moree using Burkard traps.  The reliability of measurements from a single site to represent the distribution of  airborne concentrations of spores across each town was examined using data from three  traps simultaneously, sited 2.0 to 4.9 km apart, over four weeks. Substantial intra-class  correlation coefficients (ICC) were observed between the three sampling sites across  both towns (ICC=0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.71 to 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.87) when counts of  Alternaria spores were relatively high. The correlation was poor when counts were low.  Of more than 365 trap tapes examined, the two microscopic traverses strongly correlated  for counts of Alternaria spores (ICC=0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96). Alternaria was detected  in both towns throughout the two year period with peaks in spore concentrations  reflecting the season of crop harvesting in each region.  Individual exposure to spores was examined. Thirty three subjects (adults and children  from nine families) wore nasal air samplers and personal air samplers both inside and  outside their homes. The effects of activity, location, age on the inhalation of Alternaria  spores and variation between individuals in the same environment were determined.  Every subject inhaled Alternaria spores. Personal exposure to Alternaria in the home  environment varied substantially between subjects. Levels of fungal spores inhaled were  higher during periods of activity than during rest, and higher while subjects were  outdoors than indoors. During outdoor activity, the number of Alternaria spores inhaled  ranged from 4 to 794 (median 11) spores/hr.  Sources of airborne spores was investigated by sampling air above wheat and cotton  crops near the towns during harvesting and non-harvesting periods, in a grain and cotton  seed storage shed, and a cotton gin. Substantially higher concentrations were detected  above crops during harvesting periods compared to non-harvesting periods. Peaks were  associated with harvesting and other activities where plants were manipulated. By  regression analysis spore concentrations in both towns were modelled against those  detected above crops and with weather variables. Only one crop sampling period (cotton  harvest) independently correlated with concentrations in town. Analysis combining all  data showed concentrations of spores above crops correlated with spore concentrations  in the town when lagged by one day. Variables of rainfall and maximum temperature  influenced concentrations in both towns, and wind direction in Wagga Wagga alone.  Parents of asthmatic children were asked by questionnaire in which locations symptoms  were provoked. Asthma was reported to be exacerbated at grain farms and with  disturbance of local vegetation in town and home gardens. Nasal sampling confirmed  that activities that disturbed dust or vegetation increased the inhalation of spores.  The factors that release allergen from spores were determined in a modified Halogen  immunoassay. Approximately 60% of spores released allergen, and the proportion was  influenced by isolate, nutrient availability, viability, and not influenced by sunlight or  culture age up to 21 days. Germinating the spores significantly increased the proportion  that released total allergen and Alt a 1 (p&lt;0.0001). Alt a 1 appears to be a minor  contributor to the total allergen released from spores except when spores have  germinated.  Conclusions: People living in inland rural regions of Australia are exposed to  substantial quantities of allergenic spores of Alternaria. Exposure is a highly personal  event and is largely determined by disturbance of local vegetation releasing spores such  as from nearby crops by wind, harvesting, slashing, transport and processing of produce,  and from within town and home gardens. Most spores inhaled are likely to be allergenic,  with potency potentially increasing with viability.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">allergen;Alternaria;rural;south-eastern Australia;Australia;fungus;asthma;spore;Burkard trap;Moree;Wagga Wagga;New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Linguistic Characterisation of Design in Text-Based Virtual Worlds</field><field name="creator">Cicognani, Anna</field><field name="description">In this research, it is suggested that design in text-based virtual worlds  can be identified as a series of interactions between users and the virtual  environment, and that these interactions for design can be approached using  a linguistic perspective.  The main assumption of this research is that a parallel can be drawn between  the performance of design commands, and the one of speech acts in the  physical world. Design in text-based virtual environments can then be  articulated using a restricted set of speech acts, as design commands.  Virtual worlds, represented as spaces, can be constructed following an  architectural design metaphor. This metaphor provides a framework for the  organisation of virtual entity relationships, and for the choice of words  used to design. A linguistic characterisation is presented, by means of  design activities, prototypes and scenarios, which derive from the  architectural design metaphor.  The characterisation of design is then validated by the analysis of an  existing text-based virtual world.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design;language;virtual communities;internet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Counter-conditioning in the Extinction of Conditioned Taste Aversions</field><field name="creator">Morris, Richard</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in this thesis attempted to examine the influence of thirst on the extinction of taste aversions in rats. Differences in the amount of stimulus exposure and deprivation state between groups were controlled for. The first experiment presented two novel flavours twelve times to rats when either thirsty or sated. A preference for the flavour presented when thirsty was established. The next three experiments examined whether this preference would accelerate the extinction of a taste aversion, by first pairing a novel flavour with lithium and then presenting the conditioned flavour when rats were either sated or thirsty. No evidence of accelerated extinction was found. The final two experiments examined whether the associatively-activated representation of sucrose could function to extinguish a taste-aversion to that sucrose without presenting sucrose itself. No evidence of representation-mediated extinction was found despite evidence that the context was associated with sucrose. The results indicate that the extinction of conditioned taste aversions is not influenced by counter-conditioning due to thirst relief, and extinction of such aversions appears to be due to similar processes as other forms of conditioning.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rats;learning;tastes;LiCl;extinction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Murray River Turtle, Emydura macquarii: Population Dynamics, Nesting Ecology and Impact of the Introduced Red Fox, Vulpes vulpes</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Ricky-John</field><field name="description">I studied aspects of the ecology of the Murray River turtle, Emydura macquarii, to determine the impact of the introduced red fox, Vulpes vulpes. The fox is one of Australia's worst vertebrate pests through its predation on livestock and native mammals, but their impact on reptilian communities is not known.    I conducted a large-scale mark-recapture study to evaluate population growth of E. macquarii in the Albury region of the upper Murray River by determining growth, reproduction and survival. The study was conducted downstream of the first, and largest, impoundment on the Murray River, Lake Hume. Emydura macquarii predominantly inhabit the lagoons in the upper Murray River, as the mainstream and Lake are possibly too cool to maintain metabolic processes. They are easily captured in hoop traps and the use of live decoys maximises trap success.    Over 2000 hatchling turtles were marked and released into two lagoons between January 1997 and January 1998. Growth of these individuals is rapid over the first few years but declines towards maturity, and is indeterminate after maturity. Although growth annuli are not well defined, even on young individuals, the von Bertalanffy model describes the growth of both male and female E. macquarii. Male turtles mature at 5-6 years and females mature at  10-12 years. Female turtles may maximise reproductive potential by delaying maturity and producing one relatively large clutch (mean = 21 eggs) per year, which is positively correlated with body size (PL). Although primarily related to body size, clutch size varies annually because of environmental conditions. If winter and summer rainfalls are below average and temperatures are above average, E. macquarii may reduce clutch size to increase the chance of the eggs surviving.    Nesting predominantly occurs during the first major rain-bearing depression in November. Habitat variables, including distance from water, nearest nest, and tree, and soil type were measured for each nest to determine characteristics that attract predators. Nests close to the shoreline and trees are heavily preyed on, and nests constructed in sand are less likely to be destroyed by predators. Foxes detect nests through a combination of chemical cues from eggs and slight soil disturbances, whereas birds only destroy nests observed being constructed during the day.     Female turtles alter nesting behaviour and construct nests much further away from water when foxes were removed and as a result, nests are less dense and away from trees. Thus in high predation risk areas, turtles minimise emergence and search times to reduce the risk of direct predation by foxes. Predation is reduced when nests are in lower densities and away from trees, because predators increase search efforts when nests are in higher densities and birds are more likely to destroy nests close to trees. Reproductive success is further reduced in high predation risk areas because more nests are constructed in sandy substrates where clutch success is reduced compared to incubation in more dense substrates. Where predators are a significant source of mortality, prey may use indirect methods, such as chemical recognition, to avoid encounters. Nesting turtles did not avoid areas where fox odour was present, suggesting that they assess predation pressure from foxes by other mechanisms, such as visual recognition. However, an innate response occurs to the odour of a once common predator on the Murray River, the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), whereby turtles recognise and avoid nesting in areas where quoll odour is present. Therefore nesting turtles show a similar avoidance response to two different predators, using different mechanisms of detection. Similarly, predation risk may influence hatching times and nest emergence. The rate of embryonic development of E. macquarii may increase or eggs may hatch early so that the clutch hatches synchronously, thereby reducing the risk of predation through group emergence from the nest.    Emydura macquarii reach densities of over 100 turtles.ha-1, with the majority of the population consisting of sexually mature individuals. Emydura macquarii has a Type III survival curve where mortality is extremely high in the egg stage (93% nest predation), remaining high over the hatchling stage (minimum survival rate- 10%), but decreasing rapidly throughout the juvenile stage (~70% juvenile survival). Adult survival is extremely high, with greater than 95% of adults surviving each year. Foxes through nest predation cause most mortality but a small proportion (~3%) of nesting adult females are killed by foxes each year. A removal program evaluated the impact of foxes. In 1996, fox numbers were monitored around four lagoons by spotlighting and non-toxic bait uptake. Foxes were removed from around two of the lagoons throughout 1997 and 1998, using spotlight shooting and 1080 bait poisoning. Fox numbers were continually monitored around all four lagoons during the study. Nest predation rates remained around 90% in all sites where foxes were present, but fell to less than 50% when foxes were removed. At the same time, predation on nesting female turtles was eliminated where foxes were removed.    Demographic models using staged based survival schedules, together with growth and fecundity values for E. macquarii show a decline of 4% per year in these populations. Elasticity analyses shows that survival of adult female E. macquarii has the major influence on population stability and a reduction of nest predation alone is unlikely to address the population decline. Management options, such as reducing foxes prior to nesting around key lagoons, will stabilise the population decline, and eliminating foxes completely from certain areas with high dispersal potential, will promote recruitment of juvenile E. macquarii.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia;freshwater turtle;nesting;predation;Emydura macquarii;red fox;Vulpes vulpes;incubation;population dynamics;growth;reproduction;ecology;behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for nu(mu) to nu(e) oscillations in the NOMAD experiment</field><field name="creator">Godley, Andrew</field><field name="description">The NOMAD experiment is a neutrino oscillation experiment, capable of  identifying \nm, \nmb, \nel, \neb\ and \nt\ for use in oscillation analyses.  A search for \mutoe\ oscillations is conducted, emphasising the development  of two separate beam simulators, to provide the background, (no oscillation),  \nel\ signal.     Both beam descriptions include fits to the results of the SPY experiment  that measured hadron production from a 450~GeV proton beam on  beryllium target.  An independent analysis of the raw SPY data to  produce the particle yield is reported.     A series of criteria are described for the selection and classification of  neutrino events. These produce the data samples necessary for both tuning  the beam simulation and determining the oscillation signal.     The development of a GEANT and FLUKA based Monte Carlo beam simulator is  presented, providing good agreement to the measured neutrino beam.  This simulation method has sizeable variations depending on the  beamline geometry, which is not known precisely.  This causes  large systematic errors.     An empirical parametrisation is proposed and used for the first time in a NOMAD  oscillation search.  It uses the measured neutrino spectra at  NOMAD, except the \nel, to infer the meson production at  the target, and then predict the \nel\ spectrum.  This method  has good agreement with the data and is also  insensitive to alterations of the beamline geometry, resulting in  much smaller systematic errors.     The reduction of the systematic errors allows the \mutoe\ oscillations  search to be performed with much greater precision.  Comparisons of  the \nel/\nm\ ratio between the empirical parametrisation and data yields  no evidence for \mutoe\ oscillations, setting a limit on the mixing parameter,  $sin^2(2 \theta) &amp;lt 1.9 \times 10^{-3}  \mbox{(90\% CL)}$ at high $\Delta m^2$.

A case study with 28 couple families, 14 husbands and 14 wives who migrated from Nepal under "skill" or "professional" category and the literature review on paid and unpaid work of couple families with dependent children show that in both families the trend of change of working pattern in paid and unpaid work is similar. With the increased participation of married women in the paid labour force, men increased participation in household work. There is increased household work for both husbands and wives, but women tend to do more household "inside" and childcare work than men. In the mean time, men tend to do more work in the "masculine" sphere of "outside" work in house maintenance, repair and car care.     The only factor that differentiates working pattern of migrant families with Australian born families is the experience of migration and the category that they migrated. The change of working practice of paid and unpaid work of migrant families are affected by the change of family type from extended family to two generational family and their education and previous work experience that they brought along with them. Professional migrants who migrated family as a "unit" migrated spouse and dependent children together and they made their own decision to migrate, unlike other categories of migrants who migrated from political or economic pressure.     One of the important experiences of migrant families is that there are new opportunity, new lifestyle, new intimacy and companionship and new sharing of work between husbands and wives after migration. At the same time, there are losses of extended family relatives, close friends and cultural event which affects their day to day lives. There are Australian based friends who provided support in the initial period of migration but these families do not provide regular assistance or support which family relatives provided in Nepal.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nepalese families;paid and unpaid work;household work;migrant families;professional migrant</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Parallel Navier Stokes Solver for Natural  Convection and Free Surface Flow</field><field name="creator">Norris, Stuart Edward</field><field name="description">A parallel numerical method has been implemented   for solving the Navier  Stokes equations on  Cartesian and non-orthogonal meshes.

Firstly, it describes  the recent upgrade of the MOST to perform an imaging survey of the southern  sky. Secondly, it presents a MOST survey of the Vela supernova remnant  and follow-up multiwavelength studies.      The MOST Wide Field upgrade is the most significant instrumental  upgrade of the telescope since observations began in 1981. It has made  possible the nightly observation of fields with area ~5 square  degrees, while retaining the operating frequency of 843 MHz and the  pre-existing sensitivity to point sources and extended structure. The  MOST will now be used to make a sensitive (rms approximately 1  mJy/beam) imaging survey of the sky south of declination -30&amp;deg.   This survey consists of two components: an extragalactic  survey, which will begin in the south polar region, and a Galactic  survey of latitudes |b| &amp;lt 10&amp;deg. These are expected to take about ten  years. The upgrade has necessitated the installation of 352 new  preamplifiers and phasing circuits which are controlled by 88  distributed microcontrollers, networked using optic fibre. The thesis  documents the upgrade and describes the new systems, including  associated testing, installation and commissioning.      The thesis continues by presenting a new high-resolution radio  continuum survey of the Vela supernova remnant (SNR), made with the  MOST before the completion of the Wide Field upgrade. This remnant is  the closest and one of the brightest SNRs. The contrast between the  structures in the central pulsar-powered nebula and the synchrotron  radiation shell allows the remnant to be identified morphologically as  a member of the composite class.  The data are the first of a  composite remnant at spatial scales comparable with those available  for the Cygnus Loop and the Crab Nebula, and make possible a  comparison of radio, optical and soft X-ray emission from the resolved  shell filaments. The survey covers an area of 50 square degrees at a  resolution of 43&amp;quot x 60&amp;quot, while imaging structures on scales  up to 30'. It has been used for comparison with Wide Field  observations to evaluate the performance of the upgraded MOST.      The central plerion of the Vela SNR (Vela X) contains a network of complex  filamentary structures. The validity of the imaging of these filaments  has been confirmed with Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 1.4 GHz.  Unlike the situation in the Crab Nebula, the filaments are not well correlated  with H-alpha emission. Within a few parsec of the Vela pulsar the emission  is much more complex than previously seen: both very sharp edges and more  diffuse emission are present. It has been postulated that one of the brightest  filaments in Vela X is associated with the X-ray feature (called a `jet')  which appears to be emanating from the region of the pulsar. However, an  analysis of the MOST and VLA data shows that this radio filament has a  flat spectral index similar to another more distant filament within the  plerion, indicating that it is probably unrelated to the X-ray feature.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">(standard astronomical journal format): instrumentation: interferometers telescopes stars: winds;outflows supernova remnants ISM: individual (Vela supernova remnant) pulsars: individual (Vela pulsar;B0833-45)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial and Geochemical aspects of Selenium cycling in an Estuarine system: Lake Macquarie N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Brett Ian</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This work examined the role of micro-organisms in the biogeochemical cycling of selenium within the  benthic ecosystem of Lake Macquarie, a coastal lake in New South Wales with a history of anthropogenic heavy metal contamination.   Certain micro-organisms possess the ability to oxidise or reduce selenium (Fleming and Alexander, 1973; Doran and Alexander, 1977),  and microbial volatilisation of selenium from contaminated sediments and soils utilising naturally-occurring microflora has been  shown in overseas research (Thompson-Eagle and Frankenberger, 1992) to be a potentially effective remediation strategy.   In examining the impact of micro-organisms upon the oxidation state of selenium in Lake Macquarie sediments, this work also  investigated and characterised selenium (and heavy metal) concentrations, speciation and geochemical phase associations  (an indicator of potential bioavailability) in the sediments. Seven distinct bacterial species indigenous to Lake Macquarie were identified in this work  with the ability to reduce selenium as selenite to elemental selenium, and selenium as selenate to organic forms of selenium,  including volatile methylated selenium compounds.  Metabolic parameters calculated for these organisms compared favourably with those  reported in the literature by other researchers. Mixed populations of sediment micro-organisms were also isolated and studied in this  work for their selenite and selenate reduction abilities. Total reduction of added selenite at levels up to 100 mg/L was  recorded for a number of the organisms studied in this work.  A maximum specific uptake rate for selenite of 3040 mgSe(IV).(gcells)-1.(h)-1 for  one isolate (Shewanella putrefaciens) was determined, exceeding rates reported in the literature by other authors.   Use of the indigenous micro-organisms from Lake Macquarie for the bioremediation of selenium containing waste streams was also examined in this  work and selenium reduction in an immobilised cell reactor was demonstrated with such organisms. Concentrations, speciation, sediment core profiles  and geochemical phase associations for selenium were determined for sediment samples collected at a variety of sites throughout  Lake Macquarie and from Wyee Creek, a selenium-impacted fluvial input to the lake.   The maximum concentration of selenium obtained in this work for the lake proper was 4.04 mg/kg, considerably lower than values reported over a decade ago  (Batley, 1987) but consistent with reported reductions of selenium input into the lake from the lead-zinc smelter.  Selective extraction methodology  (Tessier et al. and BCR methods) studied geochemical phase association of selenium in Lake Macquarie sediments and found up to 44% of selenium  was in bioavailable forms.  Of interest and environmental concern was levels of selenium found in sediments of Wyee Creek, which previously  received overflows from the ash dam associated with the Vales Point Power Station.  Sediment selenium levels of up to 300 mg/kg were determined for this creek.   These were an order of magnitude or more greater than those recorded for the lake itself and are of concern as  to the potential impact on benthic organisms and those animals, including humans, who consume them. While this work can only provide a 'snapshot' of  conditions within Lake Macquarie at the time of the sampling events recorded herein, it does make several important contributions to the  understanding of selenium biogeochemistry in Lake Macquarie.  These include: presentation of the hypothesis that selenium levels in surficial sediments  being deposited in the north of the lake have decreased in recent years as a result of selenium reduction measures undertaken by the lead-zinc smelter;  determination that up to 44% of selenium in surficial sediments from the lake is associated with sediment phases in which selenium has the potential to  become remobilized and hence possibly bioavailable; and documentation of selenium concentrations in Wyee Creek, identifying the area as having  selenium concentrations an order of magnitude or more greater than the lake itself. Concerning the role played by microorganisms in the  biogeochemical cycling of selenium in Lake Macquarie, this work has: identified individual isolated and mixed cultures of bacteria that  can reduce selenium as selenite to lower oxidation states; identified individual isolated and mixed cultures of bacteria that can reduce  selenium as selenate to lower oxidation states; identified volatile methylated selenium compounds in the headspace gases of microorganisms reducing selenate; determined Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for selenate and selenite for organisms isolated from Lake Macquarie;  identified casein hydrolysate as a preferred carbon source for selenium reducing microorganisms from Lake Macquarie; and demonstrated that bioremediation of selenium contaminated waste streams using indigenous organisms from Lake Macquarie is feasible on the laboratory scale. Further research areas suggested by this work include: additional investigations of elevated selenium levels in Wyee Creek sediments; determination of the role of microbes in in-situ selenium reduction; and optimisation of selenium biotreatment/bioremediation of selenium-containing waste streams and sediments. In summary, this work, in rejecting the null hypothesis that the oxidation states of selenium in sediments from Lake Macquarie, NSW,  are independent of microbial activity and accepting the alternate hypothesis that these oxidation states are not independent of microbial activity,  contributes to the understanding of the role of microorganisms in the biogeochemical cycling of selenium, having applicability to  both the specific ecosystem of Lake Macquarie, NSW, and also to selenium cycling in the environment in general.   In addition, this work has identified selenium contamination in Wyee Creek, one of the fluvial inputs to  Lake Macquarie, which was previously been undocumented in the literature and which may pose significant potential risk to humans and the  ecosystem due to sediment selenium levels one or more orders of magnitude higher than those recorded in the lake itself.   Finally, this work has also identified a number of microorganisms indigenous to Lake Macquarie with the ability to reduce selenium from toxic,  mobile forms to less toxic, immobile or volatile forms, and these organisms have been shown to have the potential for use in treatment of  selenium contaminated waste streams and also in the bioremediation of selenium-contaminated sediments.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">selenium, Lake Macquarie, biogeochemistry, bacteria, heavy metals, Wyee Creek</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EARLY CHILDHOOD STUDENT TEACHERS' REFLECTION ON THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PRACTICE: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY</field><field name="creator">SUMSION, Jennifer</field><field name="description">During the past fifteen years there has been increasing interest in the role of reflection in  professional development, especially amongst teacher educators.  Yet although many preservice programs now place considerable  emphasis on encouraging and assisting student teachers to reflect on their practice, reflection remaings a problematic notion.   There is little consensus, for example, about what constitutes reflection, how it might be identified, and whether it can be promoted. This thesis reports a longitudinal study conducted over four years which explored the above issues within the context of an  early childhood teacher education program, in Sydney (NSW), Australia.  The specific purpose of this study was to investigate  changes in student teachers' reflection on their professional development and practice during their enrolment in the Guided Practice component  of their preservice program. A strength of this study is its focus on reflection as a multidimensional phenomenon involving far more  than the processes of analytical thought typically addressed by most previous research in this area.  Drawing on an eclectic range  of literature, this thesis argues that emotion, imagination, intuition, and contemplation can also play an integral role.   As such, it asserts that reflection can be seen, in effect, as a complex and holistic search for meaning. Conceptualising reflection in this  holistic manner raises numerous methodological challenges.   These challenges and the methodological decisions made in response to them are outlined prior to developing profiles of the  participants' reflection.  These profiles indicated that there was little consistent change in the reflection of eight of the  18 participants.  For four student teachers, on the other hand, there was some change, while for six, there was considerable change.  Several factors which appeared instrumental in hindering or promoting these student teachers' reflection are identified.   These include commitment (or lack of) to teaching and to reflection;  an epistemological perspective of received or constructed knowing; and the extent to which the learning environment was  perceived as supportive.  The study concludes with a discussion of some of the implications for teacher educators and for those  intending to undertake further research into reflection.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching, early childhood, student teacher, student, reflection, development, teacher, educator</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charles Lyell and Gideon Mantell, 1821-1852: Their Quest for Elite Status in English Geology. Supplementary Volume: The Correspondence between Charles Lyell and his family and Gideon Algernon Mantell: 1821-1852.</field><field name="creator">Wennerbom, Alan John</field><field name="description">An analysis of the correspondence between Charles Lyell and Gideon Mantell from 1821 to 1852, in conjunction  with other manuscript material, highlights the contrasting backgrounds and geological careers of the two men.  It is also characterised by two underlying themes: the nature and timing of their geological work; and the influence of various social factors  on their career plans and desire to achieve high social and scientific status. In turn, these points raise several wider issues and  inter-related questions concerning the following aspects of English geology in the first half of the nineteenth century. When, why and how did an elite group of geologists emerge in England during this period? Who were its members and what were their characteristics in common? What was the nature and scope of the geological work carried out by the identified elite? In what way did it differ from Mantell's? What social and other barriers did Mantell encounter in his search for scientific and social status? What were the critical factors? In this thesis these issues are examined on a decade-by-decade basis, in three main chapters, as a prelude to examining the central question of why Mantell,  unlike Lyell, did not achieve the status of an elite geologist.  First, an elite group of English geologists is identified through a series of prosopographic and 'screening' analyses of all members of council  of the Geological Society of London (GSL).  Geologists who did not meet the prescribed criteria are taken into account.  Thirteen geologists are identified in the penultimate and final stages of screening over the four decades.  Mantell was the only provincial identified, but he did not attain a position in the final list, which consisted exclusively of a  distinctive group of 'gentleman-specialists'. Second, the concept of a geological 'domain' is introduced to analyse the  nature and scope of the geological work carried out by the identified group. A critical finding is that all members identified  in the final 'screening' list established a 'domain' in one of four categories of the concept and were recognised as the  leading authority or exponent of the domain they had fashioned. Finally, the impact and relative importance of specific  social and other factors on the careers of Lyell and Mantell are examined.  When the findings from each decade of the three chapters are brought together it is shown that by the end of the 1820s it was necessary for a future  elite geologist to be so 'positioned' in terms of basic geological experience, location, income and available time that  he was able to identify and subsequently fashion an appropriate geological 'domain'. 'Gentleman-specialists',  such as Lyell, who were able to follow this strategy, constituted a clearly defined elite that dominated the GSL  in the 1830s and 1840s. Mantell's failure to achieve elite geological status stemmed from the fact that he placed  too much emphasis on fashioning his image and social status, rather than his scientific career.  In doing so, he let the opportunity slip of establishing a major domain - British fossil reptiles - in the early 1830s.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elite geological status; relevant social factors; geological domains; positioning, early nineteenth century England; gentlemen specialists;</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emulsion Polymerization of Vinyl Acetate</field><field name="creator">De Bruyn, Hank</field><field name="description">Abstract    This work investigates the kinetics of the emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate. Several aspects of this system have been clarified, including the induced decomposition of persulfate, retardation by oxygen and entry by, and analysis of, the aqueous phase oligomeric radicals.    It has been shown that the retardation period observed in the emulsion polymerization of VAc can be explained by the effect of traces of oxygen (&lt; 10-6 M) on the entry efficiency of the initiator-derived aqueous-phase oligomeric radicals.    Comparison of rates of polymerization in V and persulfate -initiated polymerizations together with electrospray mass spectrometry of aqueous phase oligomers, has shown that the mechanism for the induced decomposition of persulfate by vinyl acetate is chain transfer to initiator from aqueous-phase oligomeric radicals. A value has been determined for the rate coefficient for transfer to initiator, by fitting literature data to a model based on this mechanism.    The reported independence of the rate of polymerization from the monomer concentration in the emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate has been investigated. Possible explanations for this behaviour have been proposed and tested in this work, by measuring radical-loss rates directly with y-relaxation techniques. Although the Y relaxations were found to be affected by experimental artefacts, it has been demonstrated that rapid exit is not responsible for the high radical-loss rates in this system.    The major artefact identified in the y relaxations was the significant effect of relatively small exotherms on relaxation behaviour, Methodologies were developed for correcting affected data and for avoiding exotherms under certain conditions.

Under the notion of alignment, certain categories, prosodic and morphological, are required to correspond to certain other categories, prosodic or morphological. The alignment of categories is achieved through the operation of constraints which evaluate the wellformedness of outputs. The constraints on the alignment of categories and the ranking of these constraints are examined with emphasis on two Australian languages, Warlpiri and Arrernte. The aim is to provide an adequate account in the theory of Optimality of the processes of stress, reduplication and vowel harmony evident in the data.           The thesis expands on the range of edges for the alignment of feet. Foot alignment is developed to account for the fact that the edges of intonational phrases, morphemes, and specific morphemes, as well as phonologically specific syllables, play an active role in determining the location of feet. An additional finding is that the location of feet can also be determined by adjacency, resolving conflict between morphological alignment, and ensuring rhythmic harmony. Requirements on adjacency are further supported to account for segmental harmony, where harmony provides evidence for the simultaneous action of segmental and prosodic processes.         The analysis provides a unified account of binary and ternary rhythm recommending modifications to alignment of certain categories, thereby laying the groundwork to deal with variation. The account of variation involves relaxing certain constraints.    In addition, the notion of rhythm is expanded to account for onset sensitivity to stress, with evidence of this sensitivity found in reduplication and allomorphy.    The interaction of prosodic categories with each other and with morphological categories can be directly captured in OT, providing a unified and coherent account of phenomena, some of which were previously seen as exceptions and, therefore unrelated and arbitrary.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optimality, Warlpiri, arrernte, Stress, reduplication, syllables</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Shapeliness of the Shekinah: Structural Unity in the Thought of Peter Steele SJ</field><field name="creator">Rayment, Colette Eleanor</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Professor Peter Steele S.J. cuts a fascinating figure both in contemporary scholarship and poetic achievement.  His work extends over a vast range of genre from poetry to criticism, public address and intellectual journalism.  Some of his huge literary output is published, some of it awaits publication, and much of it is either uncollected or held in archival situations.  Steele is a writer who matters today not only by virtue of his leading a distinguished academic career, and being a widely published poet,  but also because for some two decades he has been a focal figure in the Society of  Jesus in Australia and New Zealand and has had  extensive experience as he would say 'plying his priesthood' in various British and American Jesuit institutions.  This has resulted in a large volume of mostly unpublished writings ranging from prayers, liturgies and reflections to homilies for private and public occasions. The challenge of addressing Steele&#65533;'s literary achievement lies in the fact that his spiritual insights form the basis of his poetic, academic,  and ethical imagination. This thesis has attempted to identify the core nature of  these insights and to trace the way in which they ramify  into the world of people, events, and art, especially literature. The basic issue concerns the principle of radiance, how it finds  expression through Steele&#65533;s major motifs or figures of  Jester,  Pilgrim Expatriate, Celebrant and Word or Witness,  and how this principal operates as the unifying basis of his thought. The thesis tries to investigate this unifying vision within the subtle diversity  of the many ways Steele encounters the modern world. In identifying Steele&#65533;s structure of thought as a radiant entity focused on the theocentre of God and emanating to the  Incarnate  God,   to the writers of the gospels and epistles, to St. Ignatius, to St. Edmund Campion and to all people especially artists,  it has been necessary to shape each chapter in a roughly parallel manner and to organise it according to these stratafications.  Each chapter places the individual motif within Steele&#65533;'s individual and Ignatian  milieux,  and examines the function of the particular  figure or motif under investigation. Each chapter will then trace the figure (Fool, Pilgrim / Expatriate, Celebrant or Word  Witness), as Steele sees it manifest in God, in Christ, in the scriptures, and as he understands it imparted to Campion, to Ignatius  as he writes the Spiritual Exercises and to writers (and readers) of literature. Each chapter also has variations appropriate to its  subject matter and medium so that for instance the chapter treating Steele&#65533;s Pilgrim figure will consider his treatment of it in both p oetics and homiletics and that treating the Word or Witness will predominantly relate to that figure to his critical appraisal of Peter Porter&#65533;s p oetry and the organisation of the latter will break from the established pattern of organisation in several major ways.  This thesis offers a study of a rich Australian talent operating intellectually, academically, imaginatively and spiritually.  If one were to seek to place Steele amongst similarly minded writers one would have to locate him in the community of writers recognised for their  classical and contemporary sophistication, writers such as Peter Porter, Seamus Heaney, Joseph Brodsky, Derek Walcott and Anthony Hecht.  In this sense Steele is international rather than Australian in his emphasis; but being a true international he also includes Australia in his thinking.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jester, pilgrim, expatriate, celebrant , word, Ignatius Loyola, Spiritual Exercises, radiance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening Mothers: Representations of motherhood in Australian films from 1900 to 1988.</field><field name="creator">Pascoe, Caroline Myra</field><field name="description">Although the position of mothers has changed considerably since the beginning of the twentieth century, an idealised notion of motherhood persists. The cinema provides a source of information about attitudes towards mothering in Australian society which is not diminished by the fact that mothers are often marginal to the narrative. While the study recognises that cinematic images are not unconditionally authoritative, it rests on the belief that films have some capacity to reflect and influence society.     The films are placed in an historical context with regard to social change in Australian society, so that the images can be understood within the context of the time of the making and viewing of the films. The depictions of the mother are scrutinised with regard to her appearance, her attitude, her relationship with others and the expectations, whether explicit or implicit, of her role. Of particular significance is what happens to her during the film and whether she is punished or rewarded for her behaviour. The conclusions reached after analysis are used to challenge those ideas which assume that portrayals of motherhood are unchangeable and timeless.    The study examines Australian feature films from 1900 to 1988. To augment its historical focus, it uses sociological, psychoanalytical and feminist theoretical writing with special relevance for motherhood and mothering practice. Looking at areas of importance to mothers, it comprises an exploration of what makes a mother good or bad; the significance of the birth of female and male children; the relationship of mothers to daughters; the mother's sexuality and the metaphor of the missing mother. It shows that images of motherhood on screen are organised according to political, social and economic requirements in the community. Further, films frequently show mothers in traditional roles which are useful for maintaining notions of patriarchal privilege in society. The analysis exposes stereotypical depictions of motherhood which are often inaccurate, unfair and oppressive to women.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">films, cinema, mother, motherhood, birth, daughter, bush</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins of Persisting Poor Aboriginal Health: An Historical Exploration of Poor Aboriginal Health and the Continuity of the Colonial Relationship as an Explanation of the Persistence of Poor Aboriginal Health.</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, William Bennett</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the history of Central Australia and specifically the development of health services in the Northern Territory.

This explanation is sought by means of an analysis of the forces which have shaped Australia's  trade policy-making towards the U.S. in the five trading sectors of wheat, sugar, beef, steel and international air passenger transport. The study adopts a theoretical framework which postulates that state actors and institutions are principally responsible for trade policy-making and  the concomitant bargaining strategies adopted to improve trade outcomes.  However, a state-centred approach needs to be qualified by state actors'  accomodation of societal-actor demands for policy action.  While exogenous to this domestic bargaining process, influences emanating from the  international political economy must also be taken into account.  The relationship within and between state and societal actors, influenced as  they are by international institutions and ideas, are critical to understanding the bargaining approaches made by one state towards another. It is argued that sectoral trading outcomes between Australia and the U.S. can be understood by reference to a bilateral bargaining process  within each trading sector.  Within each such bargaining process, Australia has, within broad bilateral and multilateral approaches, devised  strategies by which it could mobilize sectorally-specific resources to seek to exploit opportunities and minimise problems so as to improve its trading outcomes.   The nature of these sectoral strategies has been influenced by first, the nature of the U.S. policy and policy-making process; second, the Australian domestic  bargaining process between state and societal actors; and third, and to a lesser extent, prevailing ideas and the perceptions of the negotiating parties.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">economy, political economy, trade, Australia, US, U.S., United States, America, policy, policy-making, 1980s, 1990s</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Cepheid Spectra</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Melinda Marie</field><field name="description">Using high resolution optical spectra from Mount John  University Observatory, Mount Stromlo Observatory and  the Anglo-Australian Observatory, new,  high accuracy radial velocity curves have been   obtained for the two bright southern Cepheids l carinae (HR 3884)  and beta doradus (HR 1922). An indepth investigation  into period variations, cycle-to-cycle and long-term variations  in the velocity curves and the reliability of the combination of   velocity data from different observatories is carried out.  Evidence for shock waves in the atmosphere of l car and resonance   in beta dor is discussed.      A grid of static model atmospheres incorporating plane-parallel  geometry is compared with the  observational spectra of both Cepheids, using line depth ratios,  to determine the variation in   effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulence  with phase. This information is  used to determine the phase dependence of the surface-brightness  for both Cepheids. The surface brightness  variation with phase was found to follow an almost linear relationship.      The distance to and radius of the Cepheids are determined   using both a near-infrared version of the Barnes-Evans  method and the Fourier Baade-Wesselink (BW) method.   The derived radii and distances agree within the  limits of the errors for both methods.   The Fourier BW method was found to be very sensitive to   phase shifts between the photometric and spectroscopic  data and the derived distance highly dependent  on the assumed reddening.       An investigation into line profile variations in l car and  beta dor has revealed the magnitude of these phenomena  increase as the pulsational period of the Cepheid   increases. It is estimated that line level  variations introduce an additional uncertainty into derived  radii of approximately 4 per cent for beta dor and 10 per cent in lcar.  The uncertainty introduced into derived distances and radii  by line profile asymmetries  was estimated to be of the order of  6 per cent in beta dor and 10 per cent in l car.      A comparative analysis is made of the hydrogen line radial velocity  curves of l car and beta dor.  A trend in the properties of these radial velocity  curves with period has been revealed.   In longer period Cepheids, the Halpha line seems to be forming  in a region that does not partake in the pulsation as a whole,  probably in a chromospheric shell.      A quantitative analysis of the asymmetries in these lines  reveal large redward asymmetries near maximum infall velocity. The   magnitude of these asymmetries and the period  for which they are present are larger in l Car than in beta dor.  The blueward asymmetries in the Halpha line in l Car are  comparable in magnitude to the redward asymmetries while  the other lines exhibit only small blueward asymmetries.      A qualitative analysis of these line profiles with phase reveal  no conclusive evidence for line doubling in these Cepheids. Evidence  of emission is found in the Halpha and H Beta lines of beta dor and l car.   The strength and duration of the emission is found to be greater   in the longer period Cepheid. Although it is likely that this  emission is shock-related, theoretical work is needed to   determine the exact origin of the emission.      A non-LTE radiative hydrodynamic model for l Car has been created.  This atmosphere will be used in further work to calculate synthetic spectral  line profiles which will aid the interpretation  of our observational results.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cepheids radial velocity spectroscopy stars fundamental parameters atmospheres distance BE BW</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Image Restoration: Perception Based Neural Nework Models and Algorithms.</field><field name="creator">Perry, Stuart William</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis describes research into the field of image restoration. Restoration is a process by which an image suffering some form of distortion or degradation can be recovered to its original form.  Two primary concepts within this field have been investigated.   The first concept is the use of a Hopfield neural network to implement the constrained least square error method of image restoration.  In this thesis, the author reviews previous neural network restoration algorithms in the literature and builds on these algorithms to develop a  new faster version of the Hopfield neural network algorithm for image restoration. The versatility of the neural network approach is then  extended by the author to deal with the cases of spatially variant distortion and adaptive regularisation. It is found that using the  Hopfield-based neural network approach, an image suffering spatially variant degradation can be accurately restored without a substantial penalty in restoration time.  In addition, the adaptive regularisation restoration technique presented in this thesis is shown to produce superior results when compared to non-adaptive  techniques and is particularly effective when applied to the difficult, yet important, problem of semi-blind deconvolution.  The second concept investigated in this thesis, is the difficult problem of incorporating concepts involved in human visual perception into image restoration techniques.  In this thesis, the author develops a novel image error measure which compares two images based on the differences between local regional statistics rather than pixel level differences.  This measure more closely corresponds to the way humans perceive the differences between two images. Two restoration algorithms are developed by the author based on  versions of the novel image error measure. It is shown that the algorithms which utilise this error measure have improved performance and produce visually more  pleasing images in the cases of colour and grayscale images under high noise conditions. Most importantly, the perception based algorithms are shown to be  extremely tolerant of faults in the restoration algorithm and hence are very robust.  A number of experiments have been performed to demonstrate the performance of the various algorithms presented.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image restoration, adaptive image processing, neural networks, human visual system</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Empirical Study of Marine Biological Resources</field><field name="creator">Kennelly, Steven James</field><field name="description">The papers presented in this thesis represent my contributions to the empirical study of marine biological resources.

Wood dust, endotoxins, and allergenic fungi are the main hazards found in woodworking environments.  Relatively very few studies have been done on wood dust exposure. The present study was designed to comprehensively investigate the health effects of  wood dust exposure, and in particular provide new information regarding: Exposure to (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucans in an occupational environment; Levels of exposure to wood dust and biohazards associated with wood dust in different woodworking environments; Correlations among personal exposures, especially correlations between   (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucans and fungi exposures, and endotoxins and Gram (-)ve bacteria exposures; Effects of personal exposure to biohazards on lung function; Effects of personal exposure to biohazards on work-related symptoms; and Determinants of inhalable exposures (provide which factors in the environment influence the personal inhalable exposures). Workers at four different woodworking processes; two logging sites, four sawmills, one major woodchipping operation and five  joineries situated in the state of New South Wales in Australia were studied for personal exposure to inhalable dust (n=182) and respirable dust (n=81),  fungi (n=120), Gram (-)ve bacteria (n=120), inhalable endotoxin (n=160), respirable endotoxin (n=79), inhalable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan (n=105), and respirable  (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan (n=62). The workers (n=168) were also tested for lung function. A questionnaire study (n=195) was carried out to determine the prevalence  of work-related symptoms. The geometric mean inhalable exposure at logging sites was 0.56 mg/m3 (n=7), sawmills 1.59 mg/m3 (n=93),  the woodchipping mill 1.86 mg/m3 (n=9) and joineries 3.68 mg/m3 (n=66). Overall, sixty two percent of the exposures exceeded the current standards.  Among joineries, 95% of the hardwood exposures and 35% of the softwood exposures were above the relevant standards. Compared with green mills, the  percentage of samples, which exceeded the hardwood standard was high for dry mills (70% in dry mills, 50% in green mills). The respirable dust exposures were high at the joineries compared with the other worksites.  Exposure levels to fungi at logging sites and sawmills were in the range 103-104 cfu/m3, woodchipping 103-105 cfu/m3 and joineries 102-104 cfu/m3.  The predominant fungi found at sawmills were Penicillium spp. High exposure levels of Aureobasidium pullulans were also found at two sawmills.  At the woodchipping mill the predominant species were Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium spp., and Paecilomyces spp. The sawmills, which employed  kiln drying processes, had lower exposure levels of fungi compared with the green mills. Those workplaces which had efficient dust control systems  showed less exposure to fungi and bacteria. Although mean endotoxin levels were lower than the suggested threshold value of 20 ng/m3, some personal  exposures at sawmills and joineries exceeded the threshold limit value. The mean inhalable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan level at the woodchipping mill was 2.32 ng/m3, at  sawmills 1.37 ng/m3, at logging sites 2.02 ng/m3, and at joineries 0.43 ng/m3. For the respirable size fraction, mean endotoxin and mean (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan  concentrations were much lower, being similar to observed dust concentrations. Significant correlations were found between mean inhalable endotoxin and  Gram (-)ve bacteria levels (p&lt;0.0001), and mean airborne inhalable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan and fungi levels (p=0.0003). The correlations between mean respirable  endotoxin levels vs Gram (-)ve bacteria exposure levels (p=0.005), and respirable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan exposure levels vs total fungi levels (p=0.005) were also significant. Significant correlations were found between lung function and personal exposures. Multivariate analyses showed that the effect of all the  personal exposures on cross-shift decrements in lung function was more prominent among sawmill and chip mill workers compared with joinery workers. Woodworkers had markedly high prevalence of cough, phlegm, chronic bronchitis, frequent headaches, throat and eye irritations,  and nasal symptoms compared with controls. Among the woodworkers, smokers had a high prevalence of chronic bronchitis (20%)  compared with non-smokers (10%). Some workers also reported a variety of allergy problems due to exposure to various types of wood dust. Both joinery workers and sawmill and chip mill workers revealed significant correlations between work-related symptoms and personal exposures.  Chronic bronchitis was significantly correlated with personal exposure to wood dust, endotoxin, (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan, fungi, and Gram (-)ve  bacteria among joinery workers. Whereas among sawmill workers chronic bronchitis was significantly correlated with personal exposure to  endotoxin, (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan, and fungi. Woodworkers showed significant positive correlations between percentage cross-shift change (decrease) in  lung function and respiratory symptoms. Significant inverse correlations were also found among percentage predicted lung function and respiratory symptoms.  The elevated inhalable dust exposures observed in this study can be explained by a combination of factors, including:  lack of awareness of potential health effects of wood dust exposure among both management and workers, aging equipment,  inadequate and ineffective dust extraction systems or usually none especially for hand held tools, poor maintenance of the  ventilation system in some, non-segregation of dusty processes, dry sweeping, and the use of compressed air jets.  The determinant-of-exposure analysis confirmed the field observations. The significant determinants of personal inhalable dust exposures (n=163)  were found to be: local exhaust ventilation, job title, use of hand-held tools, cleaning method used, use of compressed air, and green or dry wood processed.  Type of wood processed was not found to be statistically significant. A majority of workers (~90%) did not wear appropriate respirators approved for wood dust, while the workers who did wear them, used them on average less than 50% of the time.  Workers should be protected by controlling dust at its source.  When exposure to wood dust cannot be avoided, engineering controls should be supplemented with the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wood dust, endotoxin glucans, determinant of exposures, lung function, work related symptoms, dose response relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's Selection and Evaluation of Obstetric Hospitals: A Survey of the Northern Sydney Area.</field><field name="creator">Boyes, Allison Wendy</field><field name="description">A study of women's views of maternity services in the Northern Sydney Area Health Service was conducted as a result of the changing patterns of use of the Area's 7 obstetric hospitals. 340 primiparous women living in the Northern Sydney Area who had given birth in the previous six months were approached in Early Childhood Health Centres and asked to complete a survey exploring the factors influencing their choice of obstetric hospital, postnatal length of stay in hospital, and overall satisfaction with their choice of hospital. Of the 315 eligible women, 312 (99%) consented to participate and 297 (94%) completed the survey. Overall, reputation of the hospital and quality of nursing care were the most frequent reasons given for choice of hospital and there was some evidence that women selected different hospitals for distinct reasons. Women's postnatal length of stay ranged from less than 1 day to 11 days with an average of 5.3 days. Private patients stayed an average of 1 day longer than public patients, after adjusting for delivery type and pregnancy induced hypertension. There was little evidence that women in the Northern Sydney Area Health Service desire a shorter postnatal stay with the majority of women reporting they were satisfied with their length of stay. Overall, women displayed high levels of satisfaction with their choice of hospital; at least 90% of women attending all hospitals except one reported that they would choose the same hospital for the birth of another baby.

There is an abundance of research on quality of life, much of which has influenced the significant amount of study of  quality of life for people with developmental disabilities.  According to specialist developmental disability nurses, however,  this research has little meaning for one group of people with developmental disabilities with whom they work - people  with severe multiple impairments.  Nevertheless, judgements and decisions about the lives of this group continue to be  driven by the idea of quality of life.  While the literature review found that researchers are urged to seek the perceptions of people  regarding their own quality of life by asking them, some authors have noted the difficulty in pursuing such a method with people,  such as people with severe multiple impairments, who are unable to communicate in the usual ways.  Given, then, that it is  difficult to directly determine the views of people with severe multiple impairments, this study sought the perceptions of  nurses about the quality of life of the people with whom they work. In order to discover and conceptualise nurses' views,  a symbolic interaction perspective was chosen to guide this study and data were analysed using the grounded theory approach.   The study was conducted in two stages.   Stage One consisted of semi-structured indepth interviews with expert nurses to explore their perceptions of quality of life  for the people with whom they worked.  A significant finding in these interviews was that perceptions of quality of life are mediated by interaction.   Consequently, Stage Two involved a participant observation study in which the interactions of nurses and people with severe multiple impairments were examined. Specialist developmental disability nurses have a unique view of quality of life for people with severe multiple impairments.   They refer to it as 'just little things', a phrase which masks complex nursing knowledge and skills, and which can be described by four  interrelated categories which emerged from the data:  humans being, supporting, becoming intimate, and situated belonging.   As nurses become more intimate with individuals, they perceive that people with severe multiple impairments are  humans being as they wish, and that quality resides in supporting their everyday lives in a context of situated belonging. This thesis represents a new conceptualisation of quality of life for people with severe multiple impairments,  a conceptualisation which may have significance for other groups and, indeed, for the whole quality of life enterprise.   This conceptualisation draws on knowledge not usually related to quality of life, that is, knowledge of the body, of the emotions,  of identity and of humanness. Such findings demonstrate the power of an interpretive approach in explicating the meanings nurses  have regarding quality of life.  Further, these findings have implications for how the question of quality of life is approached,  for how different ways of thinking about people impact on quality of life, and for the importance of the life in quality of life.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of life, symbolic interaction, grounded theory, disability, communication, nurse patient relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic Homonymy and the Structure of Morphological Categories: Some Lessons from Paradigm Geometry</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Jason Clift</field><field name="description">This thesis takes as its starting point proposals to model inflectional paradigms as geometrical structures, wherein systematic homonymies are constrained to occupy contiguous regions. It defines a precise criterion for assessing systematicity and shows, for a range of largely Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic data, that such models are observationally adequate in modelling systematic homonymies within a single inflectional dimension, and to a lesser extent, between different inflectional dimensions. This is taken to indicate that widely assumed characterizations of inflectional categories in terms of cross-classifying binary features are incorrect, inasmuch as such characterizations fail to predict the linearizability of natural classes of properties belonging to those categories. The same inadequacy besets attempts to account for systematic homonymies by means of rules that convert or 'refer' one morpho-syntactic representation to another.     Rather it is argued that the linearizability of natural classes of properties suggests that inflectional categories are structured as a sub-classification of those properties, but that a phenomenon of 're-marking' serves to define, under strict constraints, additional natural classes beyond those defined by the sub-classification itself. The specific sub- classifications indicated by observed patterns of homonymy are language-specific. In addition, the properties so sub-classified under a single node may in certain cases be drawn from separate morpho-syntactic categories. This is taken to indicate that the terminal nodes of a morphological sub-classification are not morpho-syntactic feature complexes but purely morphological functions performing a discontinuous mapping between morpho-syntactic and morpho-phonological representations. The systematicity of homonymy patterns, then, is shown to be evidence for a linguistic level of 'pure morphology'.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphology homonymy paradigm geometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'SIDERE MENS EADEM MUTATO': NINETEENTH-CENTURY ART COLLECTIONS AND ARCHITECTURAL STYLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY</field><field name="creator">BELL, Pamela</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to examine the nineteenth-century art collections and architectural style of the original buildings  at the University of Sydney in order to demonstrate ways in which visual material may be employed to shape public perception of an institution.   I shall argue that the architectural style of the original university buildings was specifically chosen with particular aims which extended  beyond the mere establishment of a tertiary institution for the colony.  I will also argue that the style shaped the character of the institution,  contributed to the maintenance of law and order in the colony, linked the colony more firmly than hitherto to the mother country and provided social  benefits for the founders of the institution. The instant history and character thus imposed upon the institution was reinforced by the assembly of a portrait collection in emulation  of other collections of portraits at leading institutions of the colony and the mother country, including the Oxbridge universities.   Once the building proclaimed that the institution was comparable with the great universities of the world, the subjects of the portraits  at the university could be placed in the class of founders of a great historical institution, thus at the same time enhancing the reputation  of the institution and the individuals. The construction of an indentity through visual images was extended by the benefactions of Sir Charles Nicholson,  the principal donor of works of art to the university in the nineteenth century.  I argue that his intentions in  relation to his collections were didactic but were also concerned with the entrenchment of the imperial hegemony over  the colony, and again with the enhancement of his personal repuatation.  This analysis shows how, by a complex of  personal ambition and aspiration for the colony, the style of the buildings and the art collections formed were used to establish the  colony as civilized and the new university as a bastion of English tradition.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Sydney, nineteenth century, art, collection, architecture, Nicholson, Sir Charles Nicholson, buildings, colony, portrait, institution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WOMEN AND MARRIAGE: THE HOUSING CONSEQUENCES OF OPTING OUT</field><field name="creator">YOUNG, Coral</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the housing-related implications of separation and divorce for women.   It arges that the housing circumstances must be placed within a broader perspective of the social and economic consequences and  ideological environment surrounding divorce.  In the same way, operation of the housing system must be placed within a wider context,  particularly in relation to the degree of change in its operational environment within the last 20 years. The thesis finds that the circumstances surrounding leaving a marriage are personally traumatic,  and lead to a period of economic, housing and personal crisis.  Over time, although the tendency is for establishment of re-equlibrium,  considerable disadvantages prevail for women.  The quickest method of establishing re-equilibrium for women is to repartner.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women, marriage, divorce, seperation, housing, social consequences, income</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barrels, jets and smoke-rings: Understanding  the bizarre shapes of radio supernova remnants</field><field name="creator">Gaensler, Bryan Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the various morphologies of radio supernova  remnants (SNRs), and attempts to determine whether their appearance  results from the properties of the progenitor star and its supernova  explosion, or from the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) and  ambient magnetic field into which a SNR consequently expands.  High-resolution observations of Supernova 1987A show a young remnant  whose appearance and evolution are completely dominated by the  structure of its progenitor wind.  A statistical study of the Galactic  population of bilateral SNRs demonstrates that the symmetry axes of  these remnants run parallel to the Galactic Plane. This result can be  explained by the interaction of main sequence stellar wind-bubbles with  the ambient magnetic field; expansion of SNRs into the resulting  elongated cavities results in a bilateral appearance with the observed  alignment. Radio observations of SNR G296.8-00.3 show a double-ringed  morphology which is best explained by expansion either into an  anisotropic main-sequence progenitor wind or into multiple cavities in  the ISM. Data on SNRs G309.2-00.6 and G320.4-01.2 (MSH 15-52) make a  strong case that the appearance of both remnants is significantly  affected by collimated outflows from a central source; for G309.2-00.6  the source itself is not detected, but for G320.4-01.2 there is now  compelling evidence that the remnant is associated with and is  interacting with the young pulsar PSR B1509-58.  I conclude that, while  the youngest SNRs are shaped by their progenitor's circumstellar  material, the appearance of most SNRs reflects the properties of the  local ISM and magnetic field.  Remnants which interact with an  associated pulsar or binary system appear to be rare, and are easily  distinguished by their unusual and distorted morphologies.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astronomy, astrophysics, supernovae, supernova remnants, pulsars, neutron stars</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN EVALUATION OF BANK CREDIT POLICIES FOR FARM LOAN PORTFOLIOS USING THE SIMULATION APPROACH</field><field name="creator">Bramma, Keith Michael</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk-return efficiency of credit policies for managing portfolio credit risk of banking institutions.  The focus of the empirical analysis is on the impact of risk pricing and problem loan restructuring on bank risk and returns using a simulation model that represents an operating environment of lenders servicing the Australian farm sector.  Insurance theory principles and agency relationships between a borrower and a lender are integrated into the portfolio theory framework.  The portfolio theory framework is then couched in terms of the capital budgeting approach to generate a portfolio return distribution function for a particular credit policy regime.  Borrowers are segmented by region, industry, loan maturity and credit risk class.  Each credit risk class defines risk constraints on which a stochastic simulation model may be developed for credit scoring an average borrower in a portfolio segment.  The stochastic simulation method is then used to generate loan security returns for a particular credit policy regime through time with loan return outcomes weighted by the number of borrowers in a segment to give measures of portfolio performance.  Stochastic dominance efficiency criteria are used to choose between distributions of NPV of bank returns measured for a number of credit policy alternatives.  The findings suggest that banks servicing the Australian farm sector will earn more profit without additional portfolio risk if the maximum limit to which pricing accounts for default risk in loan reviews is positively linked to volatility of gross incomes of farm business borrowers.  Importantly, credit-underwriting standards must also be formulated so as to procure farm business borrowers of above average productivity with loans that are fully secured using fixed assets.  The results of simulations also suggest that restructuring loans in event of borrower default provide for large benefits compared to a &#65533;no restructuring&#65533; option.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit risk, credit policy, portfolio theory, farm loans, simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES IN SCIENCE FICTION: FROM THE PULPS TO THE JAMES TIPTREE, JR.

However, for many years the vast literature on eugenics focused almost exclusively on the history of eugenics in Britain and America. While some aspects of eugenics in Australia are now being documented, the history of this movement largely remained to be written. Australians experienced both fears and hopes at the time of Federation in 1901. Some feared that the white population was declining and degenerating but they also hoped to create a new utopian society which would outstrip the achievements, and avoid the poverty and industrial unrest, of Britain and America. Some responded to these mixed emotions by combining notions of efficiency and progress with eugenic ideas about maximising the growth of a white population and filling the "empty spaces". It was hoped that by taking these actions Australia would avoid "racial suicide" or Asian invasion and would improve national fitness, thus avoiding "racial decay" and starting to create a "paradise of physical perfection". This thesis considers the impact of eugenics in Australia by examining three related propositions: 1. that from the 1910s to the 1930s, eugenic ideas in Australia were readily accepted because of concerns about declining birth rate; 2. that, while mainly derivative, Australian eugenics had several distinctive Australian qualities; 3. that eugenics has a legacy in many disciplines, particularly family planning and public health.  This examination of Australian eugenics is primarily from the perspective of the people, publications and organisations which contributed to this movement in the first half of this century. In addition to a consideration of their achievements, reference is also made to the influence which eugenic ideas had in such diverse fields as education, immigration, law, literature, politics, psychology and science.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcoholism, Australia, Baby Bonus, Birth Rate, Child Healt, Yellow Peril Degeneracy, Eugenics, Eugenist, Family Planning, Feeble-minded, Feminism, genetics, infant mortality, marriage certificates, maternal mortality, mental defectives, migration, naturv</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE GRANDEST IMPROVEMENT IN THE COUNTRY: AN HISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDY OF  THE GREAT NORTH ROAD, N.S.W., 1825-1836</field><field name="creator">KARSKENS, Grace</field><field name="description">The line of road originally intended to link Sydney with the booming settlements of the  Hunter Valley underwent a ten year survey and construction period, beginning in 1825 with Heneage Finch's hastily selected,  winding line, and ending in 1836 with two small road gangs caught in a continuous cycle of construction and decay.   In the interim period, however, the road had aroused the enthusiasm of the best surveyors and engineers available in the colony.   These men envisioned a fine, all-encompassing, permanent thoroughfare - a most appropriate goal in view of the contemporary optimism  with regard to the colony's future.  The structures and formations were impressive and etensive and built as far as possible according  to the latest principles emerging from the road building revolution in Britain.  The methods were, of necessity, simplified in  response to the colonial conditions of rugged terrain, vast distances and the large but unskilled and, for the main part,  unwilling convict labour force.  The results were highly successful, as is stille vident today, and never failed to impress  early travellers and reassure them that they were, after all, in a 'civilised' country.  The road never actually fulfilled  its builders' plans.  A steamboat service established between Sydney and the Hunter Valley robbed it of its role as a vital link,  and other more hospitable or more direct routes were discovered and used by what traffic did proceed on land.   After the few remaining gangs were finally withdrawn, seciton after section quickly fell into disuse and abandonment.   Both the grand and modest structures and formations were left neglected, and thus preserved, to the present day.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">great north road, great, north road, NSW, N.S.W, 1825-1836, study, construction, survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE WILL OF THE POEM: Religio-Imaginative Variations in the Poetry of James McAuley, Francis Webb, and Vincent Buckley</field><field name="creator">ROWE, Noel Michael</field><field name="description">While considering the work of James McAuley, Francis Webb and Vincent Buckley,  this thesis concentrates on the religious character of their poetry. Since it assumes that religious language is primarily metaphorical  (as distinct from dogmatic), the thesis describes the poetry by way  of its religio-imaginative relationships and structures.  James McAuley's poetry is religious, not so much because it is Catholic,  as because it voyages between despair and hope, believing always in the reasoned will.   Francis Webb's poetry, continually discovering glory in dereliction, dramatises the revelatory and redeeming power of the rejected ones -  and so works within the 'Suffering Servant' model of 'Isaiah'.  While Vincent Buckley's poetry gradually abandons Catholic language  in favour of its own 'idiom of sensation', the religious quality of that sensation is discovered more in liminal than in paradisal  possibilities - in the way 'holy spaces' are always in some sense expatriate ones.  Since each of these poets belongs in the period  of Vatican II Catholicism, the thesis next relates their work to that context.  Here, however, it searches for imaginative connections  and disconnections by setting up its comparison on the basis, not of dogmas, but of models.  Finally, the thesis interprets Webb's  'Eyre All Alone' as a search for renewed religious language, returning to its opening assumption that religious language is primarily metaphorical.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poem, poetry, McAuley, Webb, Buckley, religion, religious, religious language, Catholic, metaphorical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROCKS AND SYDNEY: SOCIETY, CULTURE AND MATERIAL LIFE 1788-C1830</field><field name="creator">KARSKENS, Grace</field><field name="description">This study explores the early history of Sydney's Rocks area at two levels.   First, it provides a much-needed history of the city's earliest, oldest-surviving and best-known precinct,  one which allows an investigation of popular beliefs about the Rocks' convict origins, and which challenges  and qualifies its reputation for lowlife, vice and squalor. Second, by examining fundamental aspects of everyday life -  townscape, community and commonality, family life and work, human interaction and rites of passage -  this study throws new light on the origins of Sydney from the perspective of the convict and ex-convict majority.   Despite longstanding historical interest in Sydney's beginnings, the cultural identity, values, habits, beliefs  of the convicts and ex-convicts remained largely hidden.  The examination of such aspects reveals another Sydney  altogether from that presented by governors, artists and mapmakers.  Instead of an orderly oupost of empire, a gaol-town,  or a 'gulag', the Sydney the Rocks represents was built and occupied largely according  to the tastes, priorities and inclination of the people, with relatively little official regulation or interference.   While the Rocks appeared 'disorderly' in the eyes of the elite, it nevertheless functioned according to cultural rules,  those of the lower orders - the artisans, shopkeepers, publicans, labouring people, the majority of whom were convicts  and ex-convicts.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Rocks, Rocks, Sydney, convicts, ex-convicts, settlers, history, culture, 1788-1830, Australia, colony, community, town, people</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Tumor Pathology</field><field name="creator">Rekas, Agata</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer, differentiation, NMR, colon cell lines</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creators, Creatures and Victim-Survivors: Word, Silence and Some Humane Voices of Self-Determination from the Wycliffe Bible of 1388 to the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights 1993.</field><field name="creator">Keable, Penelope Susan</field><field name="description">This analysis of apocalyptic rhetoric brings nine generations of the written text of the Johannine Apocalypse into a contemporary (1989-1994) framework which includes phenomena such as self-determination, mutual interdependence and psychoterror.

The thesis is a description and examination of the phonology, prosody, and morphology of Ngalakgan, based on several years of fieldwork. Ngalakgan is a language with a rich inventory of classically Gunwinyguan morphological features, including noun class agreement for all major and some minor word classes, compounding of both nouns and verbs, and a rich array of modifying and inflectional prefixes and suffixes. In Ngalakgan, there is a distinction between two kinds or 'levels' of morphology: 'root'-level and 'word'-level. Root-level morphology is lexicalised and unproductive. It is restricted to the tense/aspect/mood inflection of the small closed class of 'finite' verb roots, and to the large closed class of compounds of these roots. Word-level morphology is productive, and includes almost all prefixes, all (non-tensed) suffixes and all clitics. Only word-level structure is consistently reflected in prosodic structure; forms which are complex only at the root-level are treated as prosodic units. I show that all word-level morphemes constitute prosodic domains: every word-level stem, affix and clitic potentially begins a new domain for metrical foot structure. Geminates and glottal stops are over-represented at morpheme boundaries in complex words. In addition, they are subject to complex, non-local alternations with simple stops and zero, respectively, in Ngalakgan and related languages. The alternations are conditioned by preceding geminates and voiceless obstruent clusters, as well as by prosodic and morphological structure. I propose that voiceless obstruent clusters constitute 'boundary signals' to morphological structure, in a similar fashion to stress and, like stress, are 'licensed' by the organisation of intonation. Ngalakgan displays a quantitive-sensitive stress system in roots which is apparently unique to languages of this area. Heavy syllables in Ngalakgan are those which are articulatorily and perceptually complex: those in which the coda is followed by a consonant with a distinct place of articulation. Geminates, homorganic nasal+stop clusters and glottal stops interact with this distinction in ways which are not predicted by current prosodic theories.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linguistics, Australian Aboriginal languages, morphology, prosody, phonology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charles Dickens and the Role of Legal Institutions in Social and Moral Reform: Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and Our Mutual Friend.</field><field name="creator">Swifte, Yasmine Gai</field><field name="description">The legal system of Victorian England is integral to Charles Dickens' novels and to their moral intent.    Dickens was acutely conscious of the way in which the Victorian novel operated as a form of moral art.    As a novelist he is concerned about the victims of his society and the way in which their lots can be improved.   He therefore chooses to construct representative victims of legal institutions such as the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 and the Court of Chancery in his  novels to highlight flaws in his world and the changes that might be made to improve social conditions. This thesis will examine the way in which Dickens'  fictional enquiry into the social world his characters stand to inherit is focused on the legal system and its institutions, most particularly,  the law of succession.  By discussing three novels from different periods of his writing career, Oliver Twist (1837), Bleak House (1853) and  Our Mutual Friend (1862-1865), I will suggest how his engineering of moral outcomes shows his development as a writer.   The law of succession and related legal institutions such as the Court of Chancery, dealing with wills and inheritance,  recurs in Dickens' novels, providing the novelist with social, moral and legal identities for his characters.   These identities, as unveiled during the texts, propel the characters and plot development in particular directions in response to the novels' moral intent. The role of inheritance in Victorian society largely provides Dickens with a means to explore the adequacies of existing legal institutions,  such as the means by which to prove and execute wills and the operation of the Court of Chancery.  The role of inheritance also allows Dickens to examine the social condition of those who are deprived of an inheritance or who are  unable to enforce their legal rights.  In this respect Dickens concentrates on the appalling conditions of institutions such as workhouses  and poorhouses in Victorian society and on resultant criminal activity and prostitution in the community as the disinherited struggle to survive.   Dickens' study of crime in particular sheds invaluable light on the prevailing moral standards of, and difficulties with, his society.   Dickens acknowledges his pedagogical role as an author, providing synopses of his lessons in the prefaces to his books and  forewarning his audience of the literary devices (such as grotesquerie) that are necessary to communicate them effectively. This thesis will examine the way in which Dickens' engineering of moral outcomes through the convenient use of the  law of succession becomes increasingly sophisticated as he develops as a writer.   The stock plot device of the impoverished orphan child, a representative victim of such a Victorian legal institution as the Poor Laws  who is morally saved when elevated into gentility by a secret inheritance, sustains the plot of Oliver Twist.  The simplistic and somewhat improbable fortunes of Oliver, however, give way to the more probable moral and legal outcomes of characters  such as Jo and Richard Carstone in Bleak House.  In Bleak House Carstone, who is certainly a more interesting central protagonist than Esther Summerson  in terms of Dickens' examination of legal institutions and their effect on moral and social outcomes in the novel, makes a ruinous attempt to  manipulate the legal system and gain control over his fortune by joining the suit of Jarndyce v Jarndyce.  In Our Mutual Friend, however, a  complex and successful manipulation of the legal system is achieved by Harmon/Handford/Rokesmith, an adult and extremely resourceful character  who, in conjunction with other characters such as Bella Wilfer and Mr Boffin, is testament to the inseparability of individual and legal identities  as far as moral and social outcomes are concerned.   Throughout the novels it can be seen that the abilities of Oliver Twist,  Richard Carstone and John Rokesmith to manipulate the law of succession correlate directly to stages of Dickens' maturity  as a writer and his increasing confidence about layering texts and developing more complex and sophisticated structures in his novels. Dickens' focus on the role of inheritance, however, entails the development of perspectives on the legal system in entirety.  Oliver Twist as a novel drawing upon the traditions of sensation, and turning on events such as 'legacies, birthrights, thefts and deeds of violence',  focuses intensely on the criminal justice system and establishes Dickens' famous attraction to repulsion and use of grotesquerie and popular entertainment.   Oliver Twist also develops analogies between law and drama, establishing the foundation from which  Dickens can employ legal metaphors to great effect in his quest for reforms of the legal system and society at large in Bleak House and Our Mutual Friend.  Oliver Twist further establishes the milieu of a stratified society in which finances govern social behaviour and in which the class system is  reflected in the legal system through the denial of access to justice to those who are unable to afford it, or suffer gender inequality. Bleak House builds upon the problems outlined in Oliver Twist.  It explores the criminal system, particularly the defeminisation of the law and access to  justice issues, including the problem of delay in litigation.  Specific legal institutions such as the jury system and, most notably,  the civil branch of the Victorian legal system with a particular focus on the equitable procedures in the Court of Chancery are examined.  Jo is a transmutation of Oliver as representative victim of the Poor Laws, and his fate as such appears more probable.  Richard Carstone is, however, the central character in the novel in terms of his construction as the representative victim of the civil system  and of the law of succession. In Our Mutual Friend Dickens refines his use of the law of succession and other legal institutions to  propel characters into directions suited to his own agendas. The entire plot is constructed from the premise of the execution of a  will arising out of the death of John Harmon whose murder is a crime that has never, in fact, been committed.   The ramifications of the execution of this will and subsequent codicils are extremely interesting.   The novel further examines problems of access to justice and gender inequality under the prevailing legal system, particularly through Bella Wilfer. As part of the development of Dickens' use of the legal system there is a perceptible development of his powers of characterisation.   Richard Carstone is a more substantial and believable character than Oliver; John Harmon offers the opportunity for Dickens to experiment with a  chameleon identity.  This aspect of Dickens' development, however, has received substantial attention already, particularly by Arnold Kettle,  Barbara Hardy, Monroe Engel and Grahame Smith.  There has been, to the best of my knowledge, little work done on his use of the law of succession,  and it is here that I wish to concentrate my argument. Much of Dickens' interest in the law appears to stem from his early career as a legal clerk  in Lincoln's Inn and Doctors' Commons.  His first job, as a writing clerk in the office of Ellis and Blackmore, a small set of chambers in Holborn Court,  involved duties such as copying documents, administering the registration of wills and running errands to other legal offices and law courts.   Public offices with which Dickens came into contact in the course of this job were the Alienation Office, the Sixpenny Receivers Office, the  Prothonotaries Office, the Clerk of the Escheats, the Dispensation Office, the Affidavit Office, the Filazer's, Exigenter's and Clerk of the Outlawry's Office,  the Hanaper Office and the Six-Clerk's office .  This employment gave Dickens an exposure to a wide range of jurisdictions and legal precedents.   Through this contact with a variety of legal practices, Dickens experienced a broad range of litigation which enabled him to develop opinions on the  contemporary operation of the law and its efficacy in the administration of justice.  Such experience almost certainly sowed the seeds for  much of the critique of the legal system found in his novels. In 1829 when he joined Doctors Commons, Dickens was exposed to ecclesiastical and  naval jurisdictions including a Consistory Court, A Court of Arches, the Prerogative Court, the Delegates Court and the Admiralty Court.   In this role Dickens was employed by a firm of proctors to take notes on evidence and judgments. This job as a shorthand reporter granted Dickens the  opportunity to observe at close range members of the legal profession such as clerks, proctors, secretaries and Doctors.   Probably as much through a process of osmosis as anything else, Dickens gained an understanding of the mechanics of basic  legal procedures through this type of employment.  In order to work as a court reporter, Dickens was required to use shorthand,  a method of taking notes that perhaps allowed Dickens to develop the skill to think and write quickly. It was probably at this  early stage in his career that the duality of law and literature began to come together for Dickens, developing at a later stage  into his volumes of legal fiction.  The anonymity of the law writer's existence, as captured later in Dickens' description of Nemo  the law-writer in Bleak House, who either lived or did not live by law-writing according to Krook, also may have prompted Dickens to  begin writing original works with legal themes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Charles Dickens, Law, Criminal Procedures, Equity, Literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: relations between psychosocial factors, symptoms and sensorimotor disturbances</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Ethelle Jeanette</field><field name="description">Although a vast literature attests to the belief that psychosocial disturbance is an important component of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), the relation of life stress, psychological distress and personality to the development of these disorders is poorly understood.  The broad objective of this thesis is to provide data on relations between psychosocial factors and FGID, especially irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), in representative outpatient samples.  Issues not previously addressed are examined in a series of studies. The first two studies are concerned with relations between psychosocial factors, extraintestinal (somatic) symptoms and the number and type of FGID syndromes present at consultation and, in IBS patients, the prospective relation of psychosocial factors to changes in symptom intensity over 16 months.  The last three studies relate psychosocial factors to gastrointestinal (GI) transit, motor, and sensory function in FGID, abnormalities in these parameters representing the putative origin of symptoms in FGID.  In total, 350 patients participated, representing a 95% participation rate.   Important features of the methodology include the use of a recently standardised symptom-based classification system for FGID, an objective and reliable interview-based life stress instrument (The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule), and sophisticated and sensitive technologies to assess GI transit, motor and sensory function. Novel measures, which conceptually take into account the chronic, fluctuating and recurrent course of IBS and FD syndromes, and the tendency of these syndromes to coexist, are also included.  Thus, measures of symptom outcome assess the number of syndromes present, while the symptom intensity variable reflects the severity and frequency of both FD and IBS symptoms, if both are present.  Similarly, with respect to altered transit, and motor and sensory function, physiological outcome variables reflect not only the presence of an abnormality but the number of regions affected, and the type and number of abnormalities present.  Cross-sectional findings showed for the first time that psychosocial disturbance is associated with FGID symptomatology in a quantitative manner, that chronic life stress threat is central to this process and this stress-related process is a prominent feature of a particular group of syndromes (ie IBS/FD) defined primarily by the presence of pain and discomfort. A combination of psychological, social and biological factors combined to predict the number of FGID syndromes present at entry into the study. Prominent among them was an angry, reactive and anxious (neurotic) personality, chronic life stress threat, increased coping, poor emotional support and increased age. In addition to a greater number of FD/IBS syndromes, individuals with an anger-reactive response style had experienced more intense pain and discomfort, and displayed more complete sensorimotor disturbance.   Longitudinal data demonstrated (also for the first time) the strength, consistency and unequivocal direction of the relation of chronic threat to symptom intensity over time.  Almost all of the within subject variance in symptom intensity levels (assessed on 3 occasions over a 16 month period) was explained by the severity of chronic threat during the previous 6 months or more.  For 76% of IBS patients, the presence vs the absence of one or more highly threatening chronic stressors predicted with considerable precision, the long-term clinical outcome. Thus, no patient exposed to even one such stressor improved clinically (ie by at least 50%) over the follow-up period, while in contrast, all patients who improved clinically did so in the absence of such a stressor.  For 24% of patients, however, failure to improve clinically could not be explained by any psychological, social (including life stress) or demographic factor included in this study.  Key risk indicators of a poor outcome at 16 months were identified - chronic life stress threat, the severity of baseline GI symptomatology, and female gender.  Life stress is important because it alone determined the magnitude and direction of change in symptom intensity over time, while the severity of baseline GI symptomatology revealed the extent of improvement required to achieve a recovery, and female gender predicted the presence of a larger number of FD/IBS syndromes in women long-term. Widespread hypomotility, which was almost exclusive to women in this study, represents one factor that may inhibit improvement (or rate of improvement) for women over time.    Finally, these findings have identified a psychophysiological subgroup, with underlying psychosocial, motor (and perhaps also sensory) dysfunctions that are more specific for women than men, and which does not seem to be distinctive of any particular FGID subgroup.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">functional gastrointestinal disorders;life stress;psychological;symptoms;sensory and motor disturbances</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ECOLOGY OF FERAL CATS, FELIS CATUS, IN OPEN FOREST IN NEW SOUTH WALES: INTERACTIONS WITH FOOD RESOURCES AND FOXES</field><field name="creator">MOLSHER, Robyn Lorraine</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Despite increasing evidence for the impact of feral cats Felis catus on native fauna in Australia,  little is known of the ecology of cats, particularly factors that limit cat abundance.  The ecology of the feral cat in Australia is  represented by just 15 published studies on diet, only one of which has examined diet in relation to prey availability,  and one study of home range behaviour.  The red fox Vulpes vulpes is a significant pest to agriculture and native fauna  in Australia and widespread fox removals have been proposed by the Vertebrate Biocontrol Cooperative Research Centre (VBCRC).   However, there is concern that feral cats may increase compensatorily when fox populations are reduced, as has occurred in Western Australia,  and therefore that predation pressure may not be alleviated on native fauna following fox control programs.  This thesis is divided into two parts.   First, the diet and home range size of cats is examined in relation to prey availability, and home range overlap and habitat use are determined.   In the second part, several niche parameters (diet, home range and habitat use) that were potentially important resources for foxes and cats  were quantified to assess the potential for competition.  Avoidance and aggression between cats and foxes was examined using simultaneous  radiotracking techniques and video observations.  The hypothesis that foxes limit cats through interspecific competition  (exploitation and interference) was then tested using a fox removal experiment.   Finally, three further hypotheses were tested using a fox removal experiment to determine which factors limit feral cats at Burrendong.   The four hypotheses tested were thus: i) Cats are limited independently of foxes through other factors such as food availability;  ii) Foxes limit cats through interspecific competition (exploitation and/or interference); iii) Foxes limit cats through intraguild predation;  iv) Cats benefit from the presence of foxes through facilitation. The diets and spatial use of feral cats were examined on agricultural land on the eastern shore of Lake Burrendong,  New South Wales (32o40&#65533;S, 149o 10&#65533;E) between July 1994 and June 1997.  The major land use for the area is water catchment under the agistment of sheep Ovis aries and cattle Bos taurus.  The study area encompasses about 90 km2 of hilly terrain with undulating slopes that extend down to a flat foreshore area that has been extensively cleared of trees for grazing.  The slopes are generally well timbered and dominated by white box Eucalyptus albens woodlands with some yellow box E.  melliodora associations.  Stands of cyprus pines Callitris spp. are also common.  Feral cats and red foxes are established throughout the study area, and the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus was abundant until the arrival of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD) in June 1996.  The diet of feral cats was determined from the analysis of 499 scats.   Rabbits were the staple prey of cats, with occurrence (O) in 81.6% of scats and comprising 68.4% by volume (V).  Carrion (mostly eastern grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus and sheep) (O 21.5%, V 11.5%) was an important secondary food, particularly in winter and spring.  Other mammalian prey included brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula (O 4.6%, V 2.4%), house mice Mus domesticus (O 6.2%, V 3.2%), black rats Rattus rattus (O 2.6%, V 1.4%) and a dunnart Sminthopsis sp. (probably S. murina) (O 0.2%, V 0.006%).  Invertebrates (mostly Orthopterans) (O 41.5%, V 7.5%), vegetation (O 26.3%, V 3.6%), birds (O 4.2%, V 0.8%) and reptiles (O 3.4%, V 0.3%) were generally of minor importance in the diet.  Few significant seasonal differences were found, although invertebrates contributed significantly less, and possums more, to the mean scat volume in winter and summer respectively.    A significant dietary response was found for changes in rabbit abundance, but not for the other prey groups.   Cats continued to prey heavily on rabbits after the arrival of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease, despite the relatively low numbers of rabbits.   Ten months post-RCD, house mice increased in importance in the diet.   However, it was not known whether this represented prey switching sensu stricto or opportunistic predation on an increased mouse population, as mouse abundance was not measured during this period.  Seventy-seven cats (48 recaptures) were caught in 6762 trap nights between November 1994 and August 1996 using both cage traps and leg-hold traps.  A further 18 individual cats were trapped as non-target animals by the VBCRC Fox Sterility Project and used in this study.   Trapped adult cats were fitted with radio collars and their home range size, overlap and habitat use examined.   Home ranges and core areas were quantified using 95% and 50% kernel utilisation distributions (KE 95 and KE 50)  and minimum convex polygons (MCP 100, MCP 95, MCP 50).  Four habitat types (grassland, open woodland, open forest, and mudflats)  were delineated on aerial photographs and a habitat map produced using ARC/INFO.   Compositional analysis was used to examine habitat preference in cats. Home range sizes of cats (n = 15, 598 fixes) in winter 1995, prior to fox removal,  were similar to those reported in the only published study of cat spatial use in Australia,  but larger than those recorded elsewhere.  This may have reflected more dispersed food resources in Australia,  although home range size was not correlated significantly with rabbit abundance.  Male ranges (MCP 95   = 284 ha, n = 11)  tended to be larger than females (  = 151ha, n = 4), but no differences were detected between young (1-3 years,   = 271ha, n = 7)  and old (&gt;3 years,   = 221ha, n = 8) cats.  Cats were active both by day and night with no temporal differences being detected in range size.   Both adult male and female cats tended to be solitary, although home ranges overlapped extensively.   Kin groups were indicated (but not confirmed) as most inter-sexual overlap occurred between young and old cats.  Habitat composition of home ranges generally reflected the availability of habitats at the study site,  although cats significantly avoided mudflats.  Home ranges comprised mostly open woodland and open forest habitats  with smaller areas of grassland and mudflats.  However, within individual home ranges, cats used grassland and open woodland habitats  most often where rabbits were more abundant.  Inter-individual (sex, age) or temporal (day/night) differences in habitat use were not detected. Comparison of resource use between cats and foxes indicated a large overlap in diet, home ranges and habitat use.   Dietary breadths and overlaps between cats and foxes increased when rabbit availability declined in autumn and post-RCD.   Dietary overlap was high overall (75%), although some resource partitioning was detected.   Rabbits were more important in the diet of cats than foxes, particularly in summer, when foxes ate more grasshoppers.   Carrion, invertebrates and vegetation were more important for foxes than for cats overall.   Home ranges of both cats and foxes comprised mostly open woodland habitats followed by grassland, open forest and mudflats,  which largely reflected their relative availabilities.  However, within individual home ranges, cats showed a  preference for grassland habitats.  In addition, cats tended to deposit scats more often than foxes at rabbit warrens and at hollow log entrances,  while foxes deposited scats more often than cats on sand plots, tracks and at dams.   The large overlap in resource use between cats and foxes indicated a high potential for exploitation competition. Foxes may attempt to lessen competition by killing cats (interference competition).   Three radiocollared cats were killed by foxes and aggression was observed toward cats.   Home ranges overlapped extensively, but avoidance was indicated from the simultaneous radiotracking of both predators,  as greater separations and lower overlaps in home ranges and core areas were recorded between species than within species.   In addition, video observations suggested avoidance of carcasses by cats in the presence of foxes.  The hypothesis that foxes limit feral cats through interspecific competition was then tested using a fox removal experiment.   Foxes were reduced at two of the four sites from October 1995 using &#65533;1080&#65533; baiting and spotlight shooting by the VBCRC Predator-Prey project.   Resource use and abundance of cats were compared before and after fox removal and between treated and untreated sites.   Although no increase in cat abundance followed the removal of foxes, significant behavioural changes by cats  strongly suggested interspecific competition operating via exploitation and interference.   Exploitation competition was supported by the increased consumption of carrion by cats at the treated sites after fox removal,  while support for interference competition came from the increased use of grassland habitats at night after fox removal.   The direction of the resource shifts to more prey-rich habitats indicated asymmetry in the relationship between the two predator species.   Although the null hypothesis of no limitation of cats by foxes could not be rejected, as  no increase in cat abundance was recorded after fox removal,  interspecific competition was considered to be the most likely mechanism limiting feral cats at Burrendong.   Intraguild predation was not indicated as no cat remains were found in any of the 343 fox scats or 255 fox stomachs that were examined.   In addition, minimal evidence was found for facilitation between cats and foxes, or for food limitation. The potential for foxes to limit cats, as shown in this study, indicates that cats need to be considered in future fox control operations.   Integrated pest management, where foxes, cats and rabbits are controlled together, is strongly proposed if the objective is to  safeguard native fauna in Australia.  Further research is required to improve the effectiveness of current techniques  for censusing cat populations, particularly in forested areas.  This is essential for monitoring the effectiveness of  control campaigns and quantifying factors that limit cat populations, and ultimately for effective protection of susceptible native fauna.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral cats, foxes, competition, predation, ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Application of the Inverse Scattering Transform to some Nonlinear Singular Integro-Differential Equations.</field><field name="creator">Scoufis, George</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The quest to model wave propagation in various physical systems has produced  a large set of diverse nonlinear equations. Nonlinear singular integro-differential equations rank amongst the intricate  nonlinear wave equations available to study the classical problem of wave propagation in physical systems.  Integro-differential equations are characterized by the simultaneous presence of integration and differentiation in a single  equation. Substantial interest exists in nonlinear wave equations that are amenable to the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). The IST is an adroit mathematical technique that delivers analytical solutions of a certain type of nonlinear equation:  soliton equation. Initial value problems of numerous physically significant nonlinear equations have now been solved through  elegant and novel implementations of the IST. The prototype nonlinear singular integro-differential equation receptive to the IST is the Intermediate Long Wave (ILW) equation,  which models one-dimensional weakly nonlinear internal wave propagation in a density stratified fluid of finite total depth.  In the deep water limit the ILW equation bifurcates into a physically significant nonlinear singular integro-differential  equation known as the 'Benjamin-Ono' (BO) equation; the shallow water limit of the ILW equation is the famous Korteweg-de Vries  (KdV) equation. Both the KdV and BO equations have been solved by dissimilar implementations of the IST. The Modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation, which was  significant in the historical development of the IST. Solutions of the MKdV equation are mapped by an explicit  nonlinear transformation known as the 'Miura transformation' into solutions of the KdV equation. Historically,  the Miura transformation manifested the intimate connection between solutions of the KdV equation and the inverse  problem for the one-dimensional time independent Schroedinger equation. In light of the MKdV equation's significance, it is natural to seek 'modified' versions of the ILW and BO equations.  Solutions of each modified nonlinear singular integro-differential equation should be mapped by an analogue of the original  Miura transformation into solutions of the 'unmodified' equation. In parallel with the limiting cases of the ILW equation,  the modified version of the ILW equation should reduce to the MKdV equation in the shallow water limit and to the modified  version of the BO equation in the deep water limit. The Modified Intermediate Long Wave (MILW) and Modified Benjamin-Ono (MBO) equations are the two nonlinear singular  integro-differential equations that display all the required attributes.  Several researchers have shown that the MILW and MBO equations exhibit the signature characteristic of soliton equations.  Despite the significance of the MILW and MBO equations to soliton theory, and the possible physical applications of the  MILW and MBO equations, the initial value problems for these equations have not been solved. In this thesis we use the IST  to solve the initial value problems for the MILW and MBO equations on the real-line. The only restrictions that we place on  the initial values for the MILW and MBO equations are that they be real-valued, sufficiently smooth and decay to  zero as the absolute value of the spatial variable approaches large values.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inverse Scattering Transform, Nonlinear, Integro-Differential</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE MECHANISMS OF RESIDUAL STRESSES INDUCED BY SURFACE GRINDING</field><field name="creator">Mahdi, Mofid</field><field name="description">Abstract Grinding introduces unavoidable residual stresses of significant but unknown magnitudes.  The effect of residual stresses in surface integrity is related to the nature of the residual stresses which relies  purely on the process parameters and the workmaterial properties. It is a well-known fact that the fatigue strength of a  ground component is increased by introducing compressive stresses. On the other hand, fatigue cracks may originate at regions  of maximum tensile stress and usually at the surface of the material. Moreover, stress corrosion cracking is another consequence  of critical surface tensile stress. Added to that, the residual stresses may result in dimension alteration and surface distortion,  particularly for thin products such as plates. The beneficial effects of compressive residual stresses have been widely recognized in industry.  The wise application of such a principle would bring about improved economical use of parts subjected to fatigue loading  and aggressive environmental conditions.  Therefore a better understanding of residual stress mechanisms is necessary to increase the dimensional accuracy and improve the surface  integrity of ground elements, particularly for parts with high precision and manufactured by automated production lines.  Consequently, the development of reliable models for predicting residual stresses is of great value in reducing the amount of  measurements and experimental tests of residual stresses. Unfortunately, little effort has been devoted so far to develop appropriate models to take  into account grinding conditions, workmaterial properties and boundary conditions. This thesis aims to investigate the residual stress mechanisms induced by grinding in terms of grinding parameters.  In order to obtain a full understanding, both the roles of individual factors causing residual stresses (i.e. mechanical,  thermal and phase transformation) and their couplings were carefully studied with the aid of the finite element method. The studies include: (1) residual stresses due to thermal  grinding conditions, (2) residual stresses due to iso-thermal mechanical grinding conditions, (3) coupling of thermo-mechanical conditions, (4) coupling of thermo-phase transformation, and (5) the full coupling of all the factors.  It is found that under sole thermal grinding conditions, the heat flux associated with up-grinding may lead to a higher grinding temperature  compared with that of down-grinding. A constant flux introduces the least temperature rise if the total grinding energy is the same.  Higher convection heat transfer not only decreases the grinding temperature but also makes the temperature rise occur mainly within a  thin surface layer. A similar effect can be achieved by applying higher table speeds.  When the grinding temperature is less than the austensing temperature, surface residual stresses are tensile.  The heat generated within the grinding zone causes a very non-uniform temperature field in the workpiece.  The part of the workmaterial subjected to a higher temperature rise expands more significantly and causes compressive stresses because  of the restraint from its surrounding material that expands less. When the surface heat flux moves forward, the material outside the  grinding zone contracts under cooling. Since the workmaterial has been plastically deformed during thermal loading,  the contraction is restrained and thus a tensile stress field is generated locally. If a workpiece material experiences a critical temperature variation in grinding, phase transformation takes place and a  martensite layer appears in the immediate layer underneath the ground surface. It was found that the growth of martensite  develops a hardened zone with a higher yield stress that expands with the movement of the heat flux.  A tensile surface residual stress is then developed. When the volume growth of material takes place during phase change,  compressive residual stresses may also be generated. Under iso-thermal grinding conditions,  it was found that plane stress is mainly compressive regardless of the distribution of surface traction and the direction of  the tangential grinding force. With up-grinding, the residual stress in the grinding direction is always tensile.  However,  down-grinding may yield compressive surface residual stresses if the magnitude of the ratio of horizontal  to vertical grinding forces is sufficiently large. Moreover, it is noted that discrete surface traction, which is  more reasonable in terms of simulating the individual cutting of abrasive grits, would bring about more complex  residual stress distribution that is very sensitive to the combined effect of individual cutting grits. If thermal and mechanical grinding conditions are coupled, a state free from residual stresses may be achieved if  grinding heat is low and either the convection heat transfer or the table speed is high.  However, it is found that the full coupling of the mechanical deformation, the thermal deformation and deformation by  phase change results in tensile residual stresses. The effects of cooling and mechanical traction in this case however are minor. In summary, the research of this thesis explored the following: (a) grinding temperature development in terms of a wide range of  grinding parameters together with the effect of  temperature-dependent material properties, (b) the origin and onset of irreversible  deformation due to mechanical loading, thermal loading and phase change under critical grinding conditions, (c) the effects of individual  residual stress mechanisms and their partial and full couplings, and (d) the selection of grinding conditions to achieve beneficial residual stresses. Finally, based on the new findings in this research, a more comprehensive methodology is suggested for further study.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grinding, Finite Element Method, Residual Stresses</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics, Justice and the Human Beyond Being.</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Elisabeth Louise</field><field name="description">Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics, Justice and the Human beyond Being.  Levinas finds the early twentieth century to be marked by a rejection of the concept of humanity,  at the moment of its awakening to its own brutality.  While accepting the anti-humanist position,  insofar as it questions the primacy of free will, and an unquestionable security in its attachment to a pregiven,  universal Reason, Levinas' work questions the value of rethinking the human in terms of being.   This thesis traces Levinas' attempt to rehabilitate humanity from its devotion to ontology as first philosophy.   It argues that Levinas offers a reinterpretation of the relation of being and the human, tracing the movement in Levinas' work  from a critical attempt to rethink the human and being, to the notion of the human beyond being. The thesis begins with a critical engagement with Heideggerian ontology suggesting that Levinas' renewal  of the question of being in his prewar essays reflects a concern for the meaning of subjective existence  and its relation to the social and political totality.  These concerns lie behind his reinterpretation of  the relation of existence and the existent in his essays of the 1940's in which Levinas undertakes a critique  of a Platonic social totality and introduces a notion of the alterity of eros which does not have its value determined in  terms of a teleology of social production. From this basis, Levinas is shown to address the question of justice  by articulating the essentially ambiguous relation between the subject and another in terms of the ambivalence of the face,  and contrasting this with the alterity of love.  The development of these ideas is traced across Levinas' major works.  In Totality and Infinity, Levinas argues that the response to the singular other is conceived of as the event  of the production of a universal which affirms the tertiality of the social totality, that is, attests to the whole of humanity.   In Otherwise than Being, the relation of ethics and justice is discussed in different terms, those of the relation of the ethical Saying and the realm of the Said or being's justice.  Levinas juxtaposes the ontological tertiality of the third, with the notion of an ethical tertiality, which he calls illeity.  Illeity is found to not be reducible to the ontological tertiality of the third party, but to name the exceeding of subjectivity in terms of an absolute  susceptibility to the Other, and is an excessive concept of a singular universal: the human beyond being.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Levinas, Ethics, Justice, Humanity, Heidegger</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Shelter Outcomes of Housing: A Case Study of the Relationships between Housing and Children&#65533;s Schooling</field><field name="creator">Young, Peter George</field><field name="description">The goal of this research is to provide a clearer understanding of the non-shelter impacts of housing, and in particular of the possible processes by which aspects of housing may impact on aspects of schooling.  The intention is not to prove a causal relationship, rather to shed light on mechanisms.  To that end the approach taken is qualitative, involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with a sample of public housing tenants and a smaller group of educators.    This thesis begins with an examination of previous research around this topic.  This review identifies past studies that highlight the possible negative effects of transience as a contributor to isolation; the role that neighbourhood may play in encouraging or discouraging the valuing of schooling; a possible link between crowding and punitive parenting practices; and the impact that high housing costs can have on stress levels and therefore health.    This thesis details research that builds on this earlier body of work.  Given findings from earlier studies (in particular the importance of neighbourhood effects identified in some United States&#65533; studies), a sampling framework was developed to ensure a reasonable number of households who had experienced a change in neighbourhood as well as housing conditions.  As well, an interview schedule was developed to provide a framework to ensure that possible pathways between housing and schooling identified in earlier research would be explored in these interviews.    Public tenants were chosen as the population group from which to draw the interview sample, as this group have undergone a significant housing change (when they moved into public housing), and their income levels increase the chances of them having lived in poor quality housing in the past.      A small number of interviews with educators were also conducted.  Schools were chosen randomly from outer suburbs where poor quality housing and transience were expected to impact on school populations.  As well an inner-city school in a gentrifying suburb was also selected for interview.    These interviews identified four main themes &#65533; transience, housing amenity, neighbourhood and cost.    Transience may be a significant problem for children who are already struggling in the school system, especially those who are receiving school based remediation.  For these children, moving house may interrupt important remediation work at school, and may result in children falling further and further behind their peers.  Also, transience may contribute to family stress levels which may impact on health and happiness, thereby reducing motivation and levels of school attendance.     Housing amenity can impact on health, as a result of injuries related to poorly maintained or designed housing, from stress associated with noise and broken sleep, and from insect born illnesses due to the absence of insect screens.  Possibly the most significant housing amenity related health impact seems to be due to the link between asthma, and dust and mildew.      Neighbourhood seems to have the potential to be a significant positive and negative force in people&#65533;s lives.  Supportive neighbours can make single parenting much less stressful, for example by helping with child-care, increasing the sense of safety, and reducing isolation.  Hostile neighbours, on the other hand, can create levels of stress that may force adults and children indoors to avoid conflict.      High housing costs can cause significant stress for families.  For those who are already suffering from stress this additional pressure may contribute to stress related ill-health.  As well, these families may not be able to afford to eat properly, and may not be able to afford to pay for extra-curricula activities such as school outings, dance classes etc.  Poor diet may contribute to increased incidents of illness, and extra days missed from school.    These insights suggest some changed approaches to the design and delivery of housing assistance in Australia, so as to maximise the non-shelter benefits of such interventions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">housing;schooling;education;social policy;children;public housing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Rise and Recession of Medical Peer Review in New South Wales, 1856-1994</field><field name="creator">Thomas, David Gervaise</field><field name="description">The exercise of autonomy and self-regulation is seen in the literature as one of the basic criteria of professionalism. Since in modern states Medicine has generally been the occupational grouping which has most completely attained that status, it is seen as the model or archetype of professionalism.  This study focuses on just one aspect of medical autonomy, that relating to the right of medical professionals to be accountable only to their fellow professionals as far as the maintenance of practice standards are concerned. In this thesis, the theory underlying this system of "peer review" is examined and then its application during the course of the 20th century is traced in one particular jurisdiction, that of the State of New South Wales in Australia. The reason for the focus on NSW is that in this jurisdiction, medical autonomy existed and was exercised in a particularly pure and powerful form after it was instituted in 1900. However, it was also in NSW that for the first time anywhere in the world, an institutional challenge to medical disciplinary autonomy emerged with the establishment in 1984 of the "Complaints Unit" of the Department for Health. The thesis of this study is that as a result of this development, which within a comparatively short space of time led to the emergence of a system of "co-regulation" of medical discipline,  medical disciplinary autonomy and peer review had within a decade, been so severely challenged as to be almost extinct in this State.     In the light of theoretical frameworks provided by Weber, Habermas and the American scholar Robert Alford, the study examines the long drawn out struggle to institute medical autonomy in NSW in the 19th century, its entrenchment by subsequent legislation over the next eight decades and the "counter-attack" staged by the emergent forces of consumerism, supported by the forces of the ideology of "Public Interest Law" in the last two decades of the century. The study concludes with a discussion of the implications for definitions of professionalism which might result from the loss by Medicine in NSW, of  its right to exclusive control of medical discipline and the consequent disappearance of medical peer review.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical regulation;medical history;professionalism;health complaints;new south wales history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pachomius as Discovered in the Worlds of 4th Century Christian Egypt, Pachomian Literature and Pachomian Monasticism: A Figure of History or Hagiography?</field><field name="creator">Drayton, James Michael</field><field name="description">Pachomius as Discovered in the Worlds of 4th Century Christian Egypt, Pachomian Literature and Pachomian Monasticism: A Figure of History or Hagiography?</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pachomian monasticism;cenobitic monasticism;Throdane;hagiographic literature;gnostic thought;Hellenism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Offering of Wine: An Introductory exploration of the role of wine in the Hebrew Bible and ancient Judaism through the examination of the semantics of some keywords.</field><field name="creator">Jordan, David John</field><field name="description">The significance of wine to the residents of ancient Palestine is demonstrated by the large number of archaeological sites where a wine making installation has been identified and the role wine plays in the Hebrew Bible, the major work of literature to survive from ancient Palestine.  The role of wine in the Hebrew Bible has generated a large volume of material, although this has been partly driven by the ongoing temperance debate. Despite this there has been little or no thorough research as to which words and thus passages should be investigated to comprehensively examine wine in the Hebrew Bible. In addition those studies which do exist do not demonstrate any in-depth knowledge of wine production and its implications in translating and interpreting the Hebrew Bible. This work aims to address these two issues.  The origin of wine demonstrates that wine was known in Palestine during the Biblical period. Agriculture and Diet provide information as to the value and context of wine production. Semantic tools detail the linguistic information for examination of the ancient Hebrew words related to wine. The styles and production methods of wine and other alcoholic beverages in the ancient world set limits for the identification of beverages. All other information must be considered in the light of these four areas.  The core of this work is an examination of the key words related to wine: the likely members of the ancient Hebrew semantic field of wine the key words for grape, vine and vineyard and three words identified as installations used in wine production. It is only after such detailed examination that any in-depth study of wine in the Hebrew Bible should be considered.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hebrew Bible;wine;semantics;ancient Judaism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of digesta passage in rabbits and ringtail possums using markers and models</field><field name="creator">Herron, Fiona Michelle</field><field name="description">The common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus), a member of the family Pseudocheiridae, is an arboreal folivorous marsupial that feeds predominantly on Eucalyptus foliage. Contrary to the expectation that small body size would inhibit utilisation of a diet containing such high levels of lignified fibre because of relatively low gut volume to body mass ratios and relatively high mass-specific metabolic rates and nutrient requirements (Hume 1999), the ringtail possum is able to survive solely on a diet of Eucalyptus foliage.     The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a terrestrial herbivore and is a member of the family Leporidae that feeds predominantly on grasses. The rabbit was proposed as a digesta flow model for the ringtail possum since both are caecotrophic (periodically re-ingest caecal contents) and both are proposed to exhibit a colonic separation mechanism (CSM) where fluids and small, easily digested particles are preferentially returned to the caecum. The rabbit is of value for the modelling process since it is more accessible for experimental manipulation than the ringtail possum.    This study investigated a proposal to use digesta passage through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the rabbit as a model of digesta passage for the ringtail possum on the basis that both are caecotrophic caecum fermenters. A number of potential problems were identified with this proposal and investigation of these problems formed the basis for the research described in this thesis. Two main areas were identified as being potentially problematic: 1) fundamental flaws with the particulate markers used in digesta rate of passage studies; and 2) differences in animal behaviour and natural diet between the two subject species which suggested different digestive strategies and hence different patterns of digesta flow through the GIT.     The proposed digesta passage markers were lanthanide metals (Dy, Tm, Eu and Yb) attached to either fibrous particles (1200 - 600&#65533;m) or formalin-fixed rumen bacteria (20 &#65533; 0.2&#65533;m). These markers were shown to not be of the assumed size classes and the extent of lanthanide metal binding differed between the four metals used. An effect due to method of dosing was also observed. The findings of marker inconsistencies caused major limitation to model development and further research is necessary to clarify these markers.    The proposal to use digesta flow in the rabbit GIT as a model for digesta flow in the ringtail possum was shown to be idealistic due to the differences in anatomy and behaviour observed between the two herbivores. Laboratory observations, time series analysis and compartmental modelling confirmed the differences between the animals. This study showed: 1) the GIT of the rabbit was more complex both anatomically and functionally than that of the ringtail possum; 2) behaviour affecting digesta passage of the rabbit and ringtail were different and; 3) compartmental models confirmed the anatomical and behavioural findings. Digesta passage in the rabbit could not be modelled mathematically using data on digesta passage due to complexities of the system. In contrast, a basic model was constructed for digesta passage in the ringtail possum.    On the basis of these findings, the research hypothesis "that digesta passage in rabbits is similar to that in ringtail possums" was rejected.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rabbits;common ringtail possums;digesta passage;digesta markers;git modelling;lanthanide metals;Winsaam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bliss Delight and Pleasure in Paradise Lost</field><field name="creator">Avin, Ittamar Johanan</field><field name="description">There have been many studies of keywords in Paradise Lost.  Over the last fifty or so years words such as &#65533;wander&#65533;, &#65533;lapse&#65533;, &#65533;error&#65533;, &#65533;fruit&#65533;, &#65533;balmy&#65533;, &#65533;fall&#65533;, &#65533;hands&#65533;, among others, have attracted critics&#65533; attention.  The present enquiry brings under scrutiny three linked keywords which have up to now escaped notice.  These are the words &#65533;bliss&#65533;, &#65533;delight&#65533;, and &#65533;pleasure&#65533;.  The fundamental proposition of the thesis is that Milton does not use these words haphazardly or interchangeably in his epic poem (though in other of his poetic productions he is by no means as fastidious).  On the contrary, he self-consciously distinguishes among the three terms, assigning to each its own particular &#65533;theatre of operations&#65533;.  Meant by this is that each keyword is selectively referred to a separate structural division of the epic, thus, &#65533;bliss&#65533; has reference specifically to Heaven (or to the earthly paradise viewed as a simulacrum of Heaven), &#65533;delight&#65533; to the earthly paradise in Eden and to the prelapsarian condition nourished by it; while &#65533;pleasure&#65533;, whose signification is ambiguous, refers in its favourable sense (which is but little removed from &#65533;delight&#65533;) to the Garden and the sensations associated with it, and in its unfavourable one to postlapsarian sensations and to the fallen characters.  Insofar as the three structural divisions taken into account (Hell is not) are hierarchically organized in the epic, so too are the three keywords that answer to them.  Moreover, in relating keywords to considerations of structure, the thesis breaks new ground in Paradise Lost studies.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bliss;delight;pleasure;paradise lost;John Milton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving Synoptic Maps of the solar magnetic field</field><field name="creator">McCloughan, John Leslie</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how magnetographic data may be used to study the longterm behaviour of the magnetic field distribution across the surface of the sun.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">synoptic maps;synoptic transport equation;solar magnetic field</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Regional Trade Agreements</field><field name="creator">Melatos, Mark</field><field name="description">In the last twenty years, regional trade agreements have proliferated.  These have  usually taken the form of  customs unions (CUs) or free trade areas (FTAs).  This thesis   concentrates mostly on the formation and behaviour of CUs.    Union members levy a common external tariff (CET) on non-members.  Existing theoretical models, however, do not agree on how the CET rate is chosen.  Every model imposes a different choice rule exogenously.  In this thesis, for   the first time, plausible choice rules, based on the CU's social welfare function, are  derived endogenously.  The strategic behaviour of members  and non-members, reveals that responsibility for CET choice tends to be assumed  by the member that can induce the rest of the world to levy those tariffs members prefer   to face.    Relatively few general results exist describing the relationship between country characteristics  and trade bloc formation.  Here, new light is shed on this issue, by systematically analysing bloc  formation in an asymmetric world, and investigating the role of preferences in  coalition formation.  It is found that global   free trade is most likely to arise when all countries are similar.  Customs unions tend to form   between relatively well-endowed countries or those with similar preferences.    It is also demonstrated that CUs will usually Pareto dominate FTAs, except   where preferences differ significantly.    The role of transfers in CU formation has received relatively little attention in the regionalism  literature.  In this thesis, optimal intra-union transfers are introduced and their   impact on CET choice is investigated.  The impact of transfers on CU behaviour  depends on the direction of the transfer.  When the relatively inelastic member is the  recipient, the CU responds less aggressively to non-member tariff choices than it does  when transfers are not permitted.  However, if the relatively elastic member is the  transfer recipient, the union's aggression increases.  Moreover, when one union member exercises a similar degree   of control over both CET and transfer choice, then the equilibrium CET tends to be   lower than in the corresponding no-transfers situation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">free trade areas;customs unions;common external tariff choice;free trade;core;transfers;regionalism;trade blocs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crucial Factors in teh Development of Social Security in Thailand in Comparison with Australia</field><field name="creator">Ptanawanit, Surapone</field><field name="description">Rich people in Thailand are enjoying higher shares in income transfer than their poor counterparts. This strange phenomenon implies the malfunction of the Thai social security system. Studies on the relationship between social security development and social, economic and political factors are also very limited. These evident constraints are the rationales for this study.  A comparative study was chosen because the justification of social security problems would be more objectively valid if r000esearch findings were compared with external criteria. In addition, comparative analysis would clearly pinpoint possible factors that influenced social security development in Thailand. Like many comparative studies, this investigation did not expect only to identify possible influential factors, but it also intended to learn how the modern social security system could be established in a more developed country. However, the findings would be more adaptable if they were transferred from a country that was economically and culturally close to Thailand. By these reasons, Australia, instead of other Western countries, was more appropriate to be the case for comparison. After reviewing theoretical and empirical literature, the research methodology was designed. Basically, the study applied both qualitative and quantitative methods in analysing data gathered from Thailand and Australia.  Comparative evidence shows many problems in social security provisions in Thailand. Relatively narrow coverage, low quality and quantity of benefits and services, higher financial burdens borne by people, and marginal welfare rights are the important indications of the severity of the problems. Many factors are responsible for the existence of these problems. The problematic system of social security was partly the legacy of historical development. The effects of historical roots are intensified by many contemporary factors. Undesirable social values, volatile economic growth, late industrialisation and the defeat of socialism are the four major factors that account for the undeveloped social security system. The influences of the four major factors are supported by another four less crucial ones. These supporting factors comprise the elite&#65533;s agenda, workers&#65533; power, weak non-governmental organisations and population growth. The findings in both Thailand and Australia similarly indicate that religious institutions and colonial influence do not produce significant effects upon social security development.  The comparative findings provide valuable guidelines for the suggestions of system development. Several findings help extend existing theoretical explanations of social security development as well. The study recommends comprehensive operational strategies for the improvement of Thai social security. The study made its final suggestion on the importance of applied research based on Western knowledge and experiences for the improvement of Thai social security.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social security;social policy;Thailand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Artificial Neural Networks in Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="creator">Turner, Joseph Vernon</field><field name="description">Drug development is a long and expensive process. It is often not until potential drug candidates are administered to humans that accurate quantification of their pharmacokinetic characteristics is achieved. The goal of developing quantitative structure-pharmacokinetic relationships (QSPkRs) is to relate the molecular structure of a chemical entity with its pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this thesis artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to construct in silico predictive QSPkRs for various pharmacokinetic parameters using different drug data sets.  Drug pharmacokinetic data for all studies were taken from the literature. Information for model construction was extracted from drug molecular structure. Numerous theoretical descriptors were generated from drug structure ranging from simple constitutional and functional group counts to complex 3D quantum chemical numbers. Subsets of descriptors were selected which best modeled the target pharmacokinetic parameter(s).  Using manual selective pruning, QSPkRs for physiological clearances, volumes of distribution, and fraction bound to plasma proteins were developed for a series of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. All optimum ANN models had training and cross-validation correlations close to unity, while testing was performed with an independent set of compounds. In most cases the ANN models developed performed better than other published ANN models for the same drug data set.  The ability of ANNs to develop QSPkRs with multiple target outputs was investigated for a series of cephalosporins. Multilayer perceptron ANN models were constructed for prediction of half life, volume of distribution, clearances (whole body and renal), fraction excreted in the urine, and fraction bound to plasma proteins. The optimum model was well able to differentiate compounds in a qualitative manner while quantitative predictions were mostly in agreement with observed literature values. The ability to make simultaneous predictions of important pharmacokinetic properties of a compound made this a valuable model.  A radial-basis function ANN was employed to construct a quantitative structure-bioavailability relationship for a large, structurally diverse series of compounds. The optimum model contained descriptors encoding constitutional through to conformation dependent solubility characteristics. Prediction of bioavailability for the independent testing set were generally close to observed values. Furthermore, the optimum model provided a good qualitative tool for differentiating between drugs with either low or high experimental bioavailability.  QSPkR models constructed with ANNs were compared with multilinear regression models. ANN models were shown to be more effective at selecting a suitable subset of descriptors to model a given pharmacokinetic parameter. They also gave more accurate predictions than multilinear regression equations.  This thesis presents work which supports the use of ANNs in pharmacokinetic modeling. Successful QSPkRs were constructed using different combinations of theoretically-derived descriptors and model optimisation techniques. The results demonstrate that ANNs provide a valuable modeling tool that may be useful in drug discovery and development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANN;QSPkR;QSPR;theoretical descriptors;RBF;MLP;rho parameter;multiple output</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses' Perceptions of Clinical Decision Making in relation to Patients in Pain</field><field name="creator">Baker, Jacqueline Deborah</field><field name="description">Clinical decision-making (CDM) research has focused on diagnostic reasoning, CDM models, factors influencing CDM and the development of expertise.  The research approaches used, including phenomenology, have not addressed the question of how CDM is perceived and approached by nurses.  This study describes perceptions of CDM in relation to patients in pain using a phenomenographic methodology.    At semi-structured interviews, participants were asked to recall their responses to a situation involving a patient in pain.  The responses fell into four categories: (1) the effect of the clinical environment; (2) the role of other health professionals; (3) the place of the patient; and (4) the role of experience.  Examples of differences in perceptions that were likely to impact on the nurses&#65533; approach to CDM include: the ongoing effects of time and workload demands on CDM; nurses are initially dependent but were eventually able to make decisions autonomously; the patient who may be peripheral or central to CDM; and the nurses&#65533; move from the use of theoretical principles to experiential knowledge as reflection-on-practice is employed.  Perceptions in all categories are strongly implicated in the nurses&#65533; sense of confidence and independence.    Implications for nursing practice and nursing education suggested by the findings relate to the number of areas in which graduates work in the first year of practice, the size of new graduate workloads, graduate transition programs, the place of reflection-on-practice and undergraduate (UG) program clinical experience patterns.  Among issues for further research arising from the study are: replication of the study; detailed examination of the development of CDM in the first year of nursing practice and during UG nursing education programs; the role of other health professionals in the development of CDM behaviour; the links between CDM and clinical knowledge development; and the type of clinical environments that foster confidence and independence.  A conclusion of the study is that the way CDM is approached is influenced by the amount, quality, relevancy and recency of clinical experience.  In this study, phenomenography was shown to be an appropriate approach to the description of nurses&#65533; perceptions of CDM in relation to patients in pain.  In addition, nurses&#65533; changing perceptions over two years and the subsequent  effect on CDM behaviour were described.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical decision making;reasoning;judgement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cork and talk: The cognitive and perceptual bases of wine expertise</field><field name="creator">Hughson, Angus Rannoch Leith</field><field name="description">A number of previous studies have found that wine experts can more accurately discriminate between and describe wine samples than novices. However, the mechanisms that underlie these disparities remain unclear. This collection of studies is an investigation of whether the expert advantage is based on long-term memory structures, such as found for other obviously more cognitive skills, such as chess and bridge expertise.   Experiments 1, 2 and 3 investigated whether wine experts are better than novices in recall of wine descriptions. It was hypothesised that experts would show more accurate recall than novices, although only when the descriptions were configured in a meaningful manner, that is, consistent with grape varieties commonly grown in Australia. The findings were as expected, with experts showing impaired recall for descriptions that did not match any grape variety (Experiment 2). In addition, expert recall was superior on an incidental task (Experiment 3), when recall was unexpected, suggesting that experts automatically refer to verbal long-term memory structures during a wine-related task.  These structures consist of wine-relevant terms, and are organised by their relationship to grape varieties, and more broadly, grape colour.  Experiments 4, 5, 6 and 7 investigated the role of the above-mentioned long-term memory structures in expert descriptive ability. The results supported their involvement, since expert&#65533;s ability to identify components was affected by sample configuration (Experiment 6) in a similar way to that found for recall of wine descriptions. Additional evidence comes from the finding that, novices, when provided with a small set of grape-relevant labels during a descriptive task, performed better than subjects given either no list or a long list of labels relevant to all the different grape varieties (Experiment 4). While experts correctly identified more flavours than novices, they also made more errors (Experiment 6), suggesting that verbal long-term memory structures do not increase the accuracy of the identification of aromas and flavours by experts. Rather, they inform experts as to which labels are likely to be correct for particular styles of wine.  Experiments 8, 9 and 10 investigated both the discrimination performance of novices, intermediates and experts, as well as the role of long-term memory structures in any expert discriminative advantage. Experts (Experiments 8 and 10) and intermediates (Experiment 9) showed greater powers of discrimination than novices. However, results were equivocal in relation to the role of verbal long-term memory structures (Experiment 10), suggesting that other factors, such as perceptual learning and or memory, may be important in the expert discriminative advantage. Overall, results from these studies illustrate that long-term memory structures are essential, not only in domains of expertise that are obviously based on cognitive skills, but also that of descriptive ability with respect to wine. However, unlike in other domains, these structures do not serve to improve the relative accuracy of descriptive performance, at least with regard to aromas and flavours.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine;expertise;knowledge;cognition;perception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of techniques for measuring the water content of soil and other porous media</field><field name="creator">George, Brendan Hugh</field><field name="description">The measurement of water in soil on a potential, gravimetric or volumetric basis is considered, with studies concentrating on the measurement of water by dielectric and neutron moderation methods.  The ability of the time-domain reflectometry technique to measure water content simultaneously at different spatial locations is an important advantage of the technique.  The reported apparent dielectric by the TRASE&#65533; time-domain reflectometer and Pyelab time-domain reflectometry systems is sensitive to change in extension cable length.  In some soil, e.g. a commercial sand, the response to increasing extension length of extension cable is linear.  For other soil a linear response occurs for certain lengths of cable at different moisture contents.  A single model accounting for clay content, extension cable length, time-domain reflectometry system, probe type and inherent moisture conditions explained 62.2 % of variation from the control (0 m extension) cable.  The extension cable causes a decrease in the returning electromagnetic-wave energy; leading to a decline in the slope used in automatic end-point determination.  Calibration for each probe installation when the soil is saturated, and at small water contents is recommended.     The ability of time-domain reflectometry, frequency-domain and neutron moderation techniques in measuring soil water content in a Brown Chromosol is examined.  An in situ calibration, across a limited range of water contents, for the neutron moderation method is more sensitive to changing soil water content than the factory supplied 'universal' calibration.  Comparison of the EnviroSCAN&#65533; frequency-domain system and the NMM count ratio indicates the frequency-domain technique is more sensitive to change in soil water conditions. The EnviroSCAN&#65533; system is well suited to continuous profile-based measurement of soil water content. Results with the time-domain reflectometry technique were disappointing, indicating the limited applicability of time-domain reflectometry in profile based soil water content measurement in heavy-textured soil, or soil with a large electrical conductivity.  The method of auguring to a known depth and placement of the time-domain reflectometry probe into undisturbed soil is not recommended.     A time-domain reflectometry system is adapted for in situ measurement of water in an iron ore stockpile.  The laboratory calibration for water content of the processed iron ore compares favourably to a field calibration.  In the field study, the 28 m extension cable used to connect the probes to the time-domain reflectometry affected the end-point determination of the time-domain reflectometry system.  To account for this, 0.197 should be subtracted from the reported apparent dielectric before calculation of volumetric moisture content.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil water;hydraulic properties;water balance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermo-Mechanical Behaviour of Two Reconstituted Clays</field><field name="creator">Ghahremannejad, Behrooz</field><field name="description">The effect of temperature on soil behaviour has been the subject of many studies in recent years due to an increasing number of projects related to the application of high temperature to soil. One example is the construction of facilities for the disposal of hot high level nuclear waste canisters (150-200C) several hundred meters underground in the clay formations. Despite this, the effects and mechanism by which temperature affects the soil properties and behaviour are not fully known. A limited amount of reliable experimental data, technological difficulties and experimental methods employed by different researchers could have contributed to the uncertainties surrounding the soil behaviour at elevated temperature. Also several thermo-mechanical models have been developed for soil behaviour, but their validity needs to be examined by reliable experimental data.  In this research, efforts have been made to improve the experimental techniques. Direct displacement measuring devices have been successfully used for the first time to measure axial and lateral displacements of clay samples during tests at various temperatures. The thermo mechanical behaviour of two reconstituted clays has been investigated by performing triaxial and permeability tests at elevated temperature. Undrained and drained triaxial tests were carried out on normally consolidated and over consolidated samples of M44 clay and Kaolin C1C under different effective stresses, and at temperatures between 22C and 100C. Permeability tests were carried out on samples of M44 clay at temperatures between 22C and 50C. The effects of temperature on permeability, volume change, pore pressure development, shear strength and stiffness, stress strain response and critical state parameters for different consolidation histories have been investigated by comparing the results at various temperatures. The results are also compared with the predictions of two models.  It has been found that at elevated temperature the shear strength, friction angle and initial small strain stiffness reduce whereas permeability increases. The slope of the swelling line in the v-p&#65533; plane has been found to reduce with temperature. The slope of the isotropic normal consolidation line (INCL) and critical state line (CSL) in the v-p&#65533; plane have been observed to be independent of temperature, but both the INCL and the CSL shift downwards to lower locations as temperature increases. The deformations during drained cooling and re heating cycles have been found to be elastic and to simply reflect the expansivity of the soils solid particles. The thermal volume changes during undrained heating have been observed to be direct results of the thermal expansion of water and clay particles. The internal displacement measuring devices have been found to produce reliable data for the variation of strains at elevated temperature.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temperature;heating;clay;mechanical;triaxial;Cam Clay;permeability;strength;critical state;nuclear disposal;consolidation;model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Results of Federalism: an examination of housing and disability services</field><field name="creator">Monro, Dugald John</field><field name="description">Housing and disability services</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">federalism;intergovernmental relations;housing policy;disability services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social construction of illiteracy: a study of the construction of illiteracy within schooling and methods to overcome it.</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Peter Burnett</field><field name="description">Pre-literate children experience written text as a meaningless material object, the word-object, but the compulsory and institutional aspects of reading pedagogy make this an experience from which they cannot escape. Some children begin to associate their own negative experiental sense with the word-object before they are able to learn to read.       As reading pedagogy continues, these children begin to read back experiental sense which prevents them from converting the word-object to meaningful text. Experiental sense is repressed because it is psychically painful. It retains qualities of phenomena repressed from childhood: it is active and intractable to reason.       The result is an intractable illiteracy which may be interpreted as biologically based &#65533;dyslexia.&#65533; Further attempts at reading pedagogy in childhood and adulthood generally result in reproduction of the inability because this pedagogy requires learners to attempt to read linguistically which elicits experiental sense. As these children become adults, their avoidance of reading sometimes structures their social relations to accommodate and compound their problems.         The method to overcome the problem replaces experiental sense with positive feelings about written language. The power of language to denote emotions of pleasure and affirmation from learners&#65533; lives is used. These emotions are enhanced through a technique of affirmative intersubjectivity. Short spoken affirmative texts are made by learners, tape recorded and reproduced as written texts by the literacy worker. Through allowing learners control and autonomy over their spoken and written texts, the positive emotions in them are associated by learners with the written  texts.        Exercises on the affirmative written texts are used to demonstrate regularities about written language. Learners then progress to reading suitable independent texts and other activities.

SMA-composites are a new material which have the possibility of having a large impact on what the structures as we know today, are constructed with. SMA-composites are adaptive materials which can be used to control the shape and frequencies of vibration of a structure. In order to determine the effectiveness of such a material, research into the functional properties of SMAs and SMA-composites was conducted.    As an initial step, the transformation behaviour of constrained SMAs was investigated in order to obtain a better understanding into the recovery stress generation of these wires when embedded into a composite material. It is known that the transformation is based on two types of martensite within the alloy; self accommodating and preferentially oriented martensite. The amounts of each type and how they vary with differing pre-strain were determined through DSC measurements and an explanation for why preferentially oriented martensite is not observed during DSC testing was made.    The next step was to investigate the effectiveness of embedding SMA wires into composites and the thermomechanical properties of the SMA wires and the SMA-composites were determined. This was completed using a specially designed tensile testing machine which was capable of having the whole specimen immersed into an oil bath and heated and cooled repeatedly. The stress-strain, strain-temperature, stress-temperature, resistance-strain and cyclic properties of various wires were obtained, giving a better understanding of the behaviour of SMA wires under different test conditions. NiTiCu SMA wires were embedded into kevlar composite materials and the recovery stress generation (stress-temperature), stress-strain, and strain-temperature behaviour was determined.    If SMA-composites are to be used as new materials for structural applications, verification that the embedment of pre-strained SMA wires into the material doesn't adversely affect the impact behaviour needs to be carried out. SMA-composite specimens with varying volume fractions of superelastic SMA wires, pre-strain and position through the thickness were made up for impact damage characterisation. These specimens were impacted at three different energy levels. The results showed that by embedding SMA wires into composite materials there is a reasonably low damage accumulation after impact. There is also no adverse impact effect on the structure compared with structures without wires as well as structures with other types of wires such as steel and martensitic SMA wires. The SMA-composites showed good damping and energy absorption capabilities.    A novel application of SMA-composites is their use as a SMA patch in order to repair damage in existing cracked metallic structures. An analytical study and finite element modelling showing the closure stresses obtainable for use as patches was made.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shape memory alloys;SMA;composites;thermomechanical behaviour;impact damage</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation Salience: A Model of Equivalence in Translation (Arabic/English)</field><field name="creator">Trotter, William</field><field name="description">The term equivalence describes the relationship between a translation and the text from which it is translated.  Translation is generally viewed as indeterminate insofar as there is no single acceptable translation - but many.  Despite this, the rationalist metaphor of translation equivalence prevails. Rationalist approaches view translation as a process in which an original text is analysed to a level of abstraction, then transferred into a second representation from which a translation is generated.  At the deepest level of abstraction, representations for analysis and generation are identical and transfer becomes redundant, while at the surface level it is said that surface textual features are transferred directly.  Such approaches do not provide a principled explanation of how or why abstraction takes place in translation.  They also fail to resolve the dilemma of specifying the depth of transfer appropriate for a given translation task. By focusing on the translator&#65533;s role as mediator of communication, equivalence can be understood as the coordination of information about situations and states of mind. A fundamental opposition is posited between the transfer of rule-like or codifiable aspects of equivalence and those non-codifiable aspects in which salient information is coordinated. The Translation Salience model proposes that Transfer and Salience constitute bipolar extremes of a continuum. The model offers a principled account of the translator&#65533;s interlingual attunement to multi-placed coordination, proposing that salient information can be accounted for with three primary notions: markedness, implicitness and localness. Chapter Two develops the Translation Salience model.     The model is supported with empirical evidence from published translations of Arabic and English texts. Salience is illustrated in Chapter Three through contextualized interpretations associated with various Arabic communication resources (repetition, code switching, agreement, address in relative clauses, and the disambiguation of presentative structures). Measurability of the model is addressed in Chapter Four with reference to emerging computational techniques. Further research is suggested in connection with theme and focus, text type, cohesion and collocation relations.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">translation;equivalence;salience;Arabic;English;indeterminacy;meaning;interpretation;computation;natural language processing;contrastive analysis;transfer;coordination;markedness;implicitness;localness;repetition;code switching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking the dynamics of capital accumulation in colonial and post-colonial Indonesia: Production Regulation</field><field name="creator">Mack, Andrew Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the forces driving a series of momentous transformations to Indonesia&#65533;s production and distribution systems since early colonial rule. The analysis of these forces is anchored in four conceptual themes: the basis of these systemic transformations, their politico-economic ordering as driven by a surplus-creation imperative, labour&#65533;s role in this imperative and its response to the &#65533;ordering&#65533;, and the mode of production as the historical setting within which the transformations occur.  This thesis illuminates an analytical gap in the literature by nominating labour as the key force in wealth-creation and recognising its active role in challenging ruling appropriation regimes and in the broader social struggles against exploitation and oppression.      The thematic focus defines the boundaries for an exploration of successive colonial and post-colonial ruling regimes.  Early chapters examine how the Dutch penetrated the Indonesian politico-economy, entrenching their systems of production organisation and creating an exclusionary system of wealth appropriation. Appropriation systems are characterised by transitions in European political and economic systems, especially from mercantilism to industrial capitalism. The entrenchment of colonial power is considered in relation to the expansion of capitalist organisation in Indonesia.  The state&#65533;s stimulation of this expansion is associated with an undermining of the country&#65533;s reproductive base and a growing challenge to foreign rule.  The Japanese occupying force&#65533; demolition of colonial productive and distributive linkages and encouragement of independence activism is connected with a post-war struggle for independence. Links are drawn between colonial rule and the tensions and organisational difficulties faced by Republican regimes leading up to the New Order&#65533;s re-establishment of a strict regulatory regime, and the development of an indigenous system of capitalist organisation. The surplus-generation and appropriation perspective informs the evolution of Indonesia&#65533;s productive and economic systems across colonial and post-colonial epochs and the challenges to the system of social and production regulation that heralded the destabilisation of New Order rule and the rise of the contemporary era of political democracy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labour regulation;colonial wealth extraction;class analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THREE DIMENSIONAL LIQUEFACTION ANALYSIS OF OFFSHORE FOUNDATIONS</field><field name="creator">Taiebat, Hossein Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis presents numerical techniques which have been developed to analyse three dimensional problems in offshore engineering. In particular, the three dimensional liquefaction analysis of offshore foundations on granular soils is the main subject of the thesis.     The subject matter is broadly divided into four sections:    1)Development of an efficient method for the three dimensional elasto?plastic finite element analysis of consolidating soil through the use of a discrete Fourier representation of field quantities.    2)Validation of the three dimensional method through analyses of shallow offshore foundations subjected to three dimensional loading and investigation of the yield locus for foundations on purely cohesive soils.    3)Formulation of governing equations suitable for three dimensional liquefaction analyses of offshore foundations founded on granular soil, presentation of a method for liquefaction analyses, and application of the method in modified elastic liquefaction analyses of offshore foundations.    4)Application of a conventional elasto?plastic soil model in the liquefaction analyses of offshore foundations using the three dimensional finite element method.    The finite element method developed in this thesis provides a rigorous and efficient numerical tool for the analysis of geotechnical problems subjected to three dimensional loading. The efficiency of the numerical tool makes it possible to tackle some of the problems in geotechnical engineering which would otherwise need enormous computing time and thus would be impractical. The accuracy of the numerical scheme is demonstrated by solving the bearing capacity problem of shallow foundations subjected to three dimensional loading. The generalized governing equations and the numerical method for liquefaction analyses presented in this thesis provide a solid base for the analysis of offshore foundations subjected to cyclic wave loading where they are founded on potentially liquefiable soil. The practicability of the numerical scheme is also demonstrated by a modified elastic liquefaction analysis of offshore foundations. The liquefaction phenomenon is redefined in the context of the conventional Mohr?Coulomb model, so that a relatively simple and practical model for elasto?plastic liquefaction analysis is presented.     The three dimensional finite element method together with the numerical scheme for liquefaction analysis and the elasto?plastic soil model provide a suitable practical engineering tool for exploring the responses of offshore foundations subjected to cyclic wave loading.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3D finite element;Offshore foundations;Liquefaction;Bearing capacity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maternal Abject</field><field name="creator">Astore, Mireille</field><field name="description">Abstract      In this Research paper and through my Studio practice, I search for what binds me and separates me from my children.  I investigate abjection theories through Julia Kristeva and Georges Bataille and focus on a particular form I call the maternal abject. This occurs at the time an infant separates from its mother, acquires language and maps its own body. I am proposing that the mapping of the body is the point at which an individual perceives social structures and learns about prohibitions and taboos, hence the abject. I also investigate the relationship between the maternal abject and the artistic process through the writings of Kristeva. Abjection is illustrated through the works of Mona Hatoum, Fiona Hall, Hieronymus Bosch, and Paul Quinn. The maternal abject is illustrated through the works of Mary Kelly, Cindy Sherman, Frida Kahlo, Louise Bourgeois. A possible reading of the maternal abject is given through the works of Gregory Crewdson, Joel-Peter Witkin and Francis Bacon.    The studio work is in two parts. The first part is a series of layered photomedia images. The layers consist of a naked female body, which has been merged with Renaissance like Madonna and Child images. Texture, such as stones and spikes, is embedded to signify the fragility and strength of the body. Children are also present and are merged with the adult female body. All images are cradled in a darkened atmosphere in order to draw the viewer inside the images. The second part is a bassinet, which has been drilled and pierced by thousands of pearl-headed steel pins. This piece signifies the dichotomy of the motherhood experience, which on the one hand is rewarding and fulfilling and on the other an abject and isolating experience of no apparent economic value.  The two parts interact so that the bassinet piece with its threatening exterior acts as an aggressor towards the photomedia images.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motherhood;abjection;personal;photography;photomedia;digital photography;Madonna and child;women;art;Julia Kristeva;Mon Hatoum;Fiona Hall;Cindy Sherman;Gregory Crewdson;Mary Kelly;Frida Kahlo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of accessions of Austrodanthonia spp. to factors associated with soil acidity</field><field name="creator">Islam, Mohammed Anowarul</field><field name="description">Pasture plants already adapted to acidic soil conditions are required as part of an integrated approach (with lime amelioration) to managing acid soils on the Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the usefulness of Austrodanthonia species for this purpose. The material evaluated in this study was collected during a previous survey of the distribution of Austrodanthonia on the Central, Southern and Monaro Tablelands of New South Wales. It was hypothesised that the genus Austrodanthonia has a wide range of tolerance to acid soils.  A series of experiments that provided information on the growth and physiology of Austrodanthonia in relation to soil acidity, with a view to the identification and eventual domestication of the most promising plant material have been conducted through pot, hydroponics and field investigations.  Firstly, soils were acidified or limed to obtain a range of soil pH and Al concentrations. This experiment showed that adding aluminium sulfate and calcium carbonate followed by washing excess salts with water is a simple, rapid and convenient method for adjusting soil pH for pot experiments. The pH of the amended soils remained relatively unchanged eight months after treatment. The experimental set-up also resulted in a wide range of soluble Al (2-52 mg/kg) across the soils.  The relative Al-tolerance of 183 accessions from 15 Austrodanthonia species was tested in a pot experiment using a range of soil pH. Emergence, survival and growth of all accessions were drastically reduced by high soil acidity (pH 3.9, P &lt; 0.001). About 11% of plants emerged at pH 3.9, whereas at pH 4.4 and 5.3, ~72% of plants emerged. Accessions exhibited large variation within and between species in their tolerance to soil acidity. From the species/accessions tested, 49 accessions from eight species were selected for further study (on the basis of being more acid tolerant).  Hydroponic experiments conducted in the glasshouse evaluated: (i) formulation of nutrient solution with a stable pH, (ii) effectiveness of the formulation using tap water and deionised water and (iii) estimation of free ion activities of Al and Mn in the nutrient solution and their effects on Austrodanthonia growth. These experiments showed that a NO3-N/NH4-N ratio of 9:4 is the most appropriate ratio to obtain a stable pH 4.0 without affecting plant growth; that there was little difference between tap water and deionised water on the ionic effects of Al and Mn, and plant-size did not play a role on accession survival and that accessions of Austrodanthonia could grow well within a wide range of pH (3.5-5.5), Al (50-250 &#65533;M) and Mn (100-2000 &#65533;M). Growth of Austrodanthonia accessions declined under high acidity (pH &lt; 3.5) and Al (300 &#65533;M), but tolerated high concentrations of Mn (2000 &#65533;M).  Root-tips stained with hematoxylin grouped accessions in a similar way to the pot and hydroponic experiments for most of the accessions tested. The intensity of root staining with hematoxylin and the differential distribution of Al in the shoots and roots provided an indication that different tolerance mechanisms may be involved with Austrodanthonia accessions. It appears that both exclusion and internal mechanisms may operate for Al- and Mn-tolerance.  A field experiment was conducted at Carcoar (33037&#65533;S, 149013&#65533;E, elevation 800 m) using gradients in soil pH and Al available on-site to grow selected accessions of Austrodanthonia. The accessions exhibited a range of responses to soil acidity. The accession responses to acidity from the pot and hydroponic experiments were similar to those obtained in the field, especially where Al was present as a low Al-challenge.  Overall, this study shows that Austrodanthonia exhibits a wide range of acid tolerance between species and accessions within species. Among the species tested, A. duttoniana and A. fulva appeared to have the greatest commercial potential, because of their productivity and acid tolerance. The variability that exists in the accessions may be exploitable in breeding and selection programs for improved cultivars.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accession;acidity;Ai toxicity;Austrodanthonia;emergence;growth;H+ toxicity;hematoxylin;hydroponics;Mn toxicity;native grass;pasture;physiology;soil pH</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of fimbrial antigens of Dichelobacter nodosus in diagnosis and pathogenesis of footrot</field><field name="creator">Dhungyel, Om Prakash</field><field name="description">Studies presented in this thesis looked at developing new methods for the diagnosis of virulent footrot (VFR) in sheep and identification of serogroups of Dichelobacter nodosus, the principal causative agent of footrot.     Earlier studies had shown that immunological memory response in sheep recovered from VFR can be aroused by natural or recurrent infection or by injection of outer membrane protein (OMP) antigens to be used as a retrospective diagnostic test for VFR. But OMP antigen was found to be non-specific in older animals. To overcome this non-specificity of OMP antigen in anamnestic response, pilus antigen was evaluated in a trial at Camden.     The results of this trial indicated that antibodies to pilus antigen can be detected over time in a manner similar to OMP antibodies so a retrospective assessment of VFR status can be made by anamnestic test with pilus antigens. The anamnestic response to pilus was similar in character to OMP antigen but unlike OMP was highly specific. The response to anamnestic challenge with pilus was determined by severity of the lesions they had expressed, with severe lesions triggering the greater responses. However, there was variation between individuals, with some (6 of 46 with severe lesions) failing to respond. This individual variation is probably mediated genetically as is response to vaccination.    This anamnestic test was tested in flocks of sheep in Nepal that had a history of VFR which had apparently been eradicated. That assessment, based on clinical findings, was confirmed by the uniformly negative results  in the pilus anamnestic test applied to a representative sample of the population. This allowed a conclusion that the virulent strains of D. nodosus involved had been eliminated from these flocks.      As mentioned in the preceding study pilus antigen was found to be very specific and ideal for retrospective diagnosis of virulent footrot with an anamnestic challenge ELISA test. However, serogroup specificity was seen as a disadvantage of using pilus antigen for the anamnestic test. The possibility of using multivalent pilus antigens was tested in another trial. These animals had been involved in a clinical expression experiment conducted by another research group and had a clinical and bacteriological history extending over  more than 12 months. After these initial trials all these animals were treated for footrot and managed for 5 months as a single flock at Camden. These were then challenged with multivalent pilus antigen (serogroup A - I) as a single injection.     The results obtained indicate that multivalent pilus anamnestic ELISA is equally effective as monovalent pilus. This has the added advantage that prior knowledge of the serogroups present in the flock is not required. It has the possibility of being used as an indirect test to check the presence of serogroups in a flock without doing the bacterial cultures. This test can identify most animals with pre-existing underrunning lesions (Scores of 3 or higher). However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test need to be tested extensively in flocks of known clinical history before it could be adopted as a routine test.     As a key component of a larger study to determine the role of fimbrial genes (fimA and fimB) of D. nodosus in the pathogenesis of footrot using allelic exchange to disrupt these genes of a strain (serogroup G), the study presented in this thesis contributed a detailed characterisation of the resultant mutant and the wild strains and tested these strains for virulence in sheep.  The results presented provided the first definitive evidence that the fimA gene is essential for virulence of D.nodosus in sheep. In vivo virulence testing of two fimA mutants showed that they were not able to establish any footrot whereas the wild type of the same strain produced virulent footrot in the same trial conducted under similar conditions. These mutant bacteria were not re-isolated from interdigital skin after in vivo challenge. This indicated that fimA mutant strains could not colonise the ovine foot, and the simplest and most likely explanation for these results was that colonisation of the interdigital skin and subsequent penetration of the stratum corneum requires the adhesive activity of type IV fimbriae. However, since these mutants also had altered ability to secrete extracellular proteases, and perhaps other as yet unknown extracellular proteins, the possibility of the involvement of these factors as major determinants of host colonisation or invasion cannot be excluded.       Current methods for the identification of the serogroup of D. nodosus present in the bacterial population requires isolation of the organism and after purification by subculture, antigenic analysis with agglutination tests. This usually takes at least 3 to 4 weeks. With the objective of developing a rapid serogroup specific PCR assay, the basis of serogroup variation in D. nodosus localised in the fimbrial gene region was exploited. A common forward primer and 9 serogroup specific reverse primers were selected from the fimbrial gene sequences of the prototype strains. Analytical sensitivity of the serogroup specific primers on chromosomal DNA was similar to PCR tests in other bacterial species reported before. Immuno-magnetic bead capture PCR method was able to detect 5 to 10 cells in cell lysates. Specificity within and between the serogroups of D. nodosus was tested with all the prototype strains. They were found to be very specific to each serogroup and specific only to D. nodosus when tested with 84 commonly found bacterial strains or strains related to D. nodosus.     To overcome the time delay in conducting 9 different amplifications to find out the prevalence of all possible serogroups in a flock multiplex PCR reactions with common forward primer and groups of 3, 4 and 5 reverse primers were successful in reducing the number of reactions to 2 (with groups of 4 and 5) or 3 (with groups of 3) primers. A drawback of the multiplex reaction was that if a template was 1000 times less concentrated that the others in the mixture it was not amplified but the margin for difference is very high.    The main aim of developing rapid serogroup specific PCR was to apply these tests directly on footrot lesion samples to make it a rapid diagnostic test for field samples. The sensitivity of the test on lesion samples was found to be very low. To try and improve the sensitivity an overnight or four days old pre-enrichment culture in broth was tested but was found to be no better than direct PCR. The immuno-magnetic capture method which improved the sensitivity of pure culture samples by 10 -100 fold also had very low sensitivity with lesion samples.            However, this drawback can be overcome by picking up colonies from 4 days old lesion cultures on hoof agar (HA) plates for serogroup specific  multiplex PCR. If the colonies are too small/ too few on the lesion cultures these can be sub cultured onto  a quarter of 4 percent HA plates and then used for the PCR test which also reduces the time taken for serogrouping at least by 2 weeks. The other advantage is that individual colonies do not need to be isolated. A PCR test can be done on pooled colonies just as well and can be used to identify all serogroups present in the sample.     Serogroup specific PCR is much faster and is more sensitive and accurate than slide agglutination tests which take 3 to 4 weeks to complete. Multiplex PCR makes it easier to detect different serogroups in a sample with a maximum of 3 PCR tests. Serogroup specific multiplex PCR will be a useful tool for footrot control based on specific vaccination. The difficulty in using the test on direct lesion swabs needs to be further looked into. There may be future advances in the application of PCR tests to clinical samples.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">footrot;Dichelobacter nodosus;fimbrial antegens;diagnosis;pathogenesis;sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solution Behaviour of Polyethylene Oxide, Nonionic Gemini Surfactants</field><field name="creator">FitzGerald, Paul Anthony</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been increasing interest in novel forms of surfactants.  Of particular interest are gemini surfactants, which consist of two conventional surfactants joined by a spacer at the head groups, as they exhibit lower critical micelle concentrations than can be achieved by conventional surfactants.  In this work, the self-assembly behaviour of several nonionic gemini surfactants with polyethylene oxide head groups (GemnEm, where n (= 20) is the number of carbons per tail and m (= 10, 15, 20 and 30) is the number of ethylene oxides per head group) were investigated.  The Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) were measured using a fluorescence probe technique.  The CMCs are all ~2 x 10?7 M, with almost no variation with m.  The CMCs are several orders of magnitude lower than conventional C12Em nonionic surfactants.  The mixing behaviour of the gemini surfactants with conventional surfactants was also studied.  They obeyed ideal mixing behaviour with both ionic and nonionic surfactants.  Micelle morphologies were studied using Small Angle Neutron Scattering.  The gemini surfactants with the larger head groups (i.e. Gem20E20 and Gem20E30) formed spherical micelles.  Gem20E15 showed strong scattering at low Q, characteristic of elongated micelles.  As the temperature was increased towards the cloud point, the scattering approached the Q-1 dependence predicted for infinite, straight rods.  The existence of anisotropic micelles was supported by the viscosity of Gem20E15, which increases by several orders of magnitude on heating towards its cloud point.  Phase behaviour was determined using Diffusive Interfacial Transport coupled to near-infrared spectroscopy.  Much of the behaviour of these systems is similar to conventional nonionic surfactants.  For example, Gem20E10 forms a dilute liquid isotropic phase (W) coexisting with a concentrated lamellar phase (La) at around room temperature and forms a sponge phase at higher temperatures.  This is similar to the behaviour of C12E3 and C12E4.  The other surfactants studied are all quite soluble in water and form liquid isotropic and hexagonal phases from room temperature.  At higher concentrations Gem20E15 formed a cubic and then a lamellar phase while Gem20E20 formed a cubic phase and then an intermediate phase.  This is also comparable to the phase behaviour of conventional nonionic surfactants except the intermediate phase, which is often only observed for surfactant systems with long alkyl tails.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non ionic gemini surfactants;SANS;CMC;Phase Behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Archaean crustal evolution: evidence from ~3.5million year old greenstone successions in the Pilgangoora Belt, Pilbara Craton, Australia</field><field name="creator">Green, Michael Godfrey</field><field name="description">In the Pilgangoora Belt of the Pilbara Craton, Australia, the 3517 Ma Coonterunah Group and 3484-3468 Ma Carlindi granitoids underlie the 3458 Ma Warrawoona Group beneath an erosional unconformity, thus providing evidence for ancient emergent continental crust. The basalts either side of the unconformity are remarkably similar, with N-MORB-normalised enrichment factors for LILE, Th, U and LREE greater than those for Ta, Nb, P, Zr, Ti, Y and M-HREE, and initial e(Nd, Hf) compositions which systematically vary with Sm/Nd, Nb/U and Nb/La ratios. Geological and geochemical evidence shows that the Warrawoona Group was erupted onto continental basement, and that these basalts assimilated small amounts of Carlindi granitoid. As the Coonterunah basalts have similar compositions, they probably formed likewise, although they were deposited &gt;60 myr before. Indeed, such a model may be applicable to most other early Pilbara greenstone successions, and so an older continental basement was probably critical for early Pilbara evolution.  The geochemical, geological and geophysical characteristics of the Pilbara greenstone successions can be best explained as flood basalt successions deposited onto thin, submerged continental basement. This magmatism was induced by thermal upwelling in the mantle, although the basalts themselves do not have compositions which reflect derivation from an anomalously hot mantle. The Carlindi granitoids probably formed by fusion of young garnet-hornblende-rich sialic crust induced by basaltic volcanism.   Early Archaean rocks have Nd-Hf isotope compositions which indicate that the young mantle had differentiated into distinct isotopic domains before 4.0 Ga. Such ancient depletion was associated with an increase of mantle Nb/U ratios to modern values, and hence this event probably reflects the extraction of an amount of continental crust equivalent to its modern mass from the primitive mantle before 3.5 Ga. Thus, a steady-state model of crustal growth is favoured whereby post ~4.0 Ga continental additions have been balanced by recycling back into the mantle, with no net global flux of continental crust at modern subduction zones. It is also proposed that the decoupling of initial e(Nd) and e(Hf) from its typical covariant behaviour was related to the formation of continental crust, perhaps by widespread formation of TTG magmas.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archaeon;Pilbara Craton;crustal evolution;elemental geochemistry;Nd isotopes;Hf isotopes;SHRIMP U-Pb dating;continental crust</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic Oxidation of 4-t-butyltoluene</field><field name="creator">Anwar Amin, Ahmed</field><field name="description">The oxidation of 4-t-butyltoluene in glacial acetic acid by hydrogen peroxid in a process catalysed by cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate and sodium bromide has been studied with the aim of increasing the selectivity towards 4-t-butylbenzaldehyde.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catalysis;oxidation;4-t-butyltoluene;cobalt acetate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Health Impact of Pesticide Exposure in a Cohort of Outdoor Workers</field><field name="creator">Beard, John Roland</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a study undertaken between 1992 and 2001 to explore the possible health impacts of human exposure to pesticides.  The study followed the health outcomes of approximately 4000 outdoor workers over a period of up to sixty-one years.  These workers comprised two subcohorts of approximately even size, one composed of agricultural workers with high insecticide exposures, and the other made up of outdoor staff from local councils in the same area with little or no occupational exposure to insecticides. Mortality and morbidity were compared between the two groups, and with the general Australian community.    The study identifies significantly increased mortality among both exposed and control subjects when compared to the Australian population.  The major cause of this increase was mortality from smoking related diseases.  The study also identifies significant increases in mortality among exposed subjects for a number of conditions that do not appear to be the result of smoking patterns, both when compared to the control group and the Australian population.  These include pancreatic cancer in some DDT exposed subjects and asthma, diabetes, and leukaemia in subjects working with more modern chemicals.  There was also an increase in self reported chronic illness and asthma, and lower neuropsychological functioning scores among surviving exposed subjects when compared to controls.  Diabetes was also reported more commonly by subjects reporting occupational use of herbicides.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pesticides;DDT;cohort study;neoplasms;pancreatic cancer;leukemia;diabetes;asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Change and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique: A Study of the Charismatic Author-Leader</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Joanne</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the significance of the publication of Betty Friedan&#65533;s The Feminine Mystique (1963) to the emergence of the second wave Women&#65533;s Liberation Movement in the US in the late 1960s. To this end, I deploy key concepts provided through social movement theory (eg collective identity, collective action frames, social problem construction). I also incorporate Max Weber and Antonio Gramsci&#65533;s insights on the indispensable role played by leaders who demonstrate a clear and effective political will.     Weber&#65533;s three part model of pure charisma is used as a general template for understanding the impact of Friedan&#65533;s text. I critique aspects of Weber&#65533;s theory of charisma, in particular his failure to appreciate that the written word can mark the initial emergence phase of charisma rather than its routinisation. I augment Weber&#65533;s insights on charismatic leadership by attending to Gramsci&#65533;s emphasis on the necessity of winning the &#65533;war of ideas&#65533; that must be waged at the level of civil society within advanced capitalist societies. I examine Gramsci&#65533;s understanding of the power available to the organic intellectual who is aligned with the interests of subaltern groups and who succeeds in revealing the hegemonic commitments of accepted &#65533;common sense&#65533;.     In the latter part of this thesis, I apply these many useful concepts to my case study analysis of Betty Friedan&#65533;s The Feminine Mystique. I argue that Friedan&#65533;s accessible, middlebrow text gave birth to a new discursive politics which was critically important not only for older women, but for a younger generation of more radicalised women. I emphasise how Friedan&#65533;s text mounted a concerted attack on the discursive construction of femininity under patriarchal capitalism. I question Friedan&#65533;s diagnostic claim that the problems American women faced were adequately captured by the terminology of the trapped housewife syndrome.     I conclude by arguing that social movement researchers have to date failed to appreciate the leadership potential of the charismatic author-leader who succeeds in addressing and offering a solution to a pressing social problem through the medium of a best-selling, middlebrow text.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social movements;Friedan;charisma;author;womens liberation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Chemical Studies of Thermochemistry, Kinetics and Molecular Structure.</field><field name="creator">Haworth, Naomi Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with a range of chemical problems which are amenable to theoretical investigation via the application of current methods of computational quantum chemistry. These problems include the calculation of accurate thermochemical data, the prediction of reaction kinetics, the study of molecular potential energy surfaces, and the investigation of molecular structures and binding.  The heats of formation (from both atomisation energies and isodesmic schemes) of a set of    approximately 120 C1 and C2 fluorocarbons and oxidised fluorocarbons (along with C3F6 and CF3CHFCF2) were calculated with the Gaussian-3 (G3) method (along with several approximations thereto). These molecules are of importance in the flame chemistry of 2-H-heptafluoropropane, which has been proposed as a potential fire retardant with which to replace chloro- and bromofluorocarbons (CFC&#65533;s and BFC&#65533;s). The calculation of the data reported here was carried out in parallel with the modelling studies of Hynes et al.1-3 of shock tube experiments on CF3CHFCF3 and on C3F6 with either hydrogen or oxygen atoms.   G3 calculations were also employed in conjunction with the experimental work of Owens et  al.4 to describe the pyrolysis of CFClBr2 (giving CFCl) at a radiation wavelength of 265 nm. The theoretical prediction of the dissociation energy of the two C-Br bonds was found to be consistent with the energy at which carbene production was first observed, thus supporting the hypothesis that the pyrolysis releases two bromine radicals (rather than a Br2 molecule). On the basis of this interpretation of the experiments, the heat of formation of CFClBr2 is predicted to be 184 &#65533; 5 kJ mol-1, in good agreement with the G3 value of 188 &#65533; 5 kJ mol-1.   Accurate thermochemical data was computed for 18 small phosphorus containing molecules (P2, P4, PH, PH2, PH3, P2H2, P2H4, PO, PO2, PO3, P2O, P2O2, HPO, HPOH, H2POH, H3PO, HOPO and HOPO2), most of which are important in the reaction model introduced by Twarowski5 for the combustion of H2 and O2 in the presence of phosphine. Twarowski reported that the H + OH recombination reaction is catalysed by the combustion products of PH3 and proposed two catalytic cycles, involving PO2, HOPO and HOPO2, to explain this observation. Using our thermochemical data we computed the rate coefficients of the most important reactions in these cycles (using transition state and RRKM theories) and confirmed that at 2000K both cycles have comparable rates and are significantly faster than the uncatalysed H + OH recombination.   The heats of formation used in this work on phosphorus compounds were calculated using the G2, G3, G3X and G3X2 methods along with the far more extensive CCSD(T)/CBS type scheme. The latter is based on the evaluation of coupled cluster energies using the correlation consistent triple-, quadruple- and pentuple-zeta basis sets and extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit along with core-valence correlation corrections (with counterpoise corrections for phosphorus atoms), scalar relativistic corrections and spin-orbit coupling effects. The CCSD(T)/CBS results are consistent with the available experimental data and therefore constitute a convenient set of benchmark values with which to compare the more approximate Gaussian-n results. The G2 and G3 methods were found to be of comparable accuracy, however both schemes consistently underestimated the benchmark atomisation energies. The performance of G3X is significantly better, having a mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the CBS results of 1.8 kcal mol-1, although the predicted atomisation energies are still consistently too low. G3X2 (including counterpoise corrections to the core-valence correlation energy for phosphorus) was found to give a slight improvement over G3X, resulting in a MAD of 1.5 kcal mol-1. Several molecules were also identified for which the approximations underlying the Gaussian-n methodologies appear to be unreliable; these include molecules with multiple or strained P-P bonds.   The potential energy surface of the NNH + O system was investigated using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p)) with the aim of determining the importance of this route in the production of NO in combustion reactions. In addition to the standard reaction channels, namely decomposition into NO + NH, N2 + OH and H + N2O via the ONNH intermediate, several new reaction pathways were also investigated. These include the direct abstraction of H by O and three product channels via the intermediate ONHN, giving N2 + OH, H + N2O and HNO + N. For each of the species corresponding to stationary points on the B3LYP surface, valence correlated CCSD(T) calculations were performed with the aug-cc-pVxZ (x = Q, 5) basis sets and the results extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Core-valence correlation corrections, scalar relativistic corrections and spin orbit effects were also included in the resulting energetics and the subsequent calculation of thermochemical data. Heats of formation were also calculated using the G3X method. Variational transition state theory was used to determine the critical points for the barrierless reactions and the resulting B3LYP energetics were scaled to be compatible with the G3X and CCSD(T)/CBS values. As the results of modelling studies are critically dependent on the heat of formation of NNH, more extensive CCSD(T)/CBS calculations were performed for this molecule, predicting the heat of formation to be 60.6 &#65533; 0.5 kcal mol-1. Rate coefficients for the overall reaction processes were obtained by the application of multi-well RRKM theory. The thermochemical and kinetic results thus obtained were subsequently used in conjunction with the GRIMech 3.0 reaction data set in modelling studies of combustion systems, including methane / air and CO / H2 / air mixtures in completely stirred reactors. This study revealed that, contrary to common belief, the NNH + O channel is a relatively minor route for the production of NO.   The structure of the inhibitor Nd-(N'-Sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine, PSOrn, and the nature of its binding to the OTCase enzyme was investigated using density functional (B3LYP) theory. The B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations on the model compound, PSO, revealed that, while this molecule could be expected to exist in an amino form in the gas phase, on complexation in the active site of the enzyme it would be expected to lose two protons to form a dinegative imino tautomer. This species is shown to bind strongly to two H3CNHC(NH2)2+ moieties (model compounds for arginine residues), indicating that the strong binding observed between inhibitor and enzyme is partially due to electrostatic interactions as well as extensive hydrogen bonding (both model Arg+ residues form hydrogen bonds to two different sites on PSO). Population analysis and hydrogen bonding studies have revealed that the intramolecular bonding in this species consists of either single or semipolar bonds (that is, S and P are not hypervalent) and that terminal oxygens (which, being involved in semipolar bonds, carry negative charges) can be expected to form up to 4 hydrogen bonds with residues in the active site.   In the course of this work several new G3 type methods were proposed, including G3MP4(SDQ) and G3[MP2(Full)], which are less expensive approximations to G3, and G3X2, which is an extension of G3X designed to incorporate additional electron correlation. As noted earlier, G3X2 shows a small improvement on G3X; G3MP4(SDQ) and G3[MP2(Full)], in turn, show good agreement with G3 results, with MAD&#65533;s of ~ 0.4 and ~ 0.5 kcal mol-1 respectively.   1.

An empirical study is undertaken to further investigate the operation of the legislation.  As part of the Enhanced Disclosure regime, the continuous disclosure provision was effective from 5 September 1994 as s1001A of the Corporations Law, now the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  This statutory provision is replaced by s674, inserted by Schedule 2 to the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth), and effective from 11 March 2002.  The provision reinforces Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rule 3.1.  The rule requires a listed disclosing entity to notify ASX immediately of information that would be expected to have a &#65533;material effect&#65533; on the share price of the company.    However, the disclosure requirement is weakened by a number of specific exemptions or &#65533;carve-outs&#65533; to listing rule 3.1.  If a reasonable person would not expect the information to be disclosed, and if the confidentiality of the information is maintained, then disclosure is not mandatory in special circumstances.     This study analyses 427 query notices, issued by ASX to listed companies from July 1995 to April 1996.  The queries request information concerning unexplained movements in a company&#65533;s share price or a failure to comply with the listing rules.  An analysis of the companies&#65533; replies to these notices provides a profile of the type of company that is likely to be queried.  The study also attempts to evaluate the extent to which these companies have relied on the &#65533;carve-outs&#65533; as an exemption to the regulation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Stock Exchange;continuous disclosure;corporation law Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encouraging the Development of Deeper Learning and Personal Teaching Efficacy: Effects of Modifying the Learning Environment in a Preservice Teacher Education Program</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Through the development and implementation of modified learning contexts, the current study encouraged undergraduate teacher education students to modify their approaches to learning by reducing their reliance on surface approaches and progressively adopting deeper approaches. This outcome was considered desirable because students who employed deep approaches would exit the course having achieved higher quality learning than those who relied primarily on surface approaches. It was expected that higher quality learning in a preservice teacher education program would also translate into greater self-confidence in the management of teaching tasks, leading to improvements in students&#65533; teaching self-efficacy beliefs.     Altered learning contexts were developed through the application of action research methodology involving core members of the teaching team. Learning activities were designed with a focus on co-operative small-group problem-based learning, which included multiple subtasks requiring variable outcome presentation modes. Linked individual reflection was encouraged by personal learning journals and learning portfolios. Students also provided critical analyses of their own learning during the completion of tasks, from both individual and group perspectives. Assessment methods included lecturer, peer and self-assessment, depending on the nature of the learning task. Often these were integrated, so that subtasks within larger ones were assessed using combinations of methods.     Learning approach theorists (Biggs, 1993a, 1999; Entwistle, 1986, 1998; Prosser &amp; Trigwell, 1999; Ramsden, 1992, 1997) contend that learning outcomes are directly related to the learning approaches used in their development. They further contend that the approach adopted is largely a result of students&#65533; intent, which in turn, is influenced by their perception of the learning context. The present study therefore aimed to develop an integrated and pervasive course-based learning context, constructively aligned (after: Biggs, 1993a, 1996), achievable within the normal constraints of a university program, that would influence students&#65533; adoption of deep learning approaches. The cognitive processes students used in response to the altered contexts were interpreted in accordance with self-regulatory internal logic (after: Bandura, 1986, 1991b; Zimmerman, 1989, 1998b).     Longitudinal quasi-experimental methods with repeated measures on non-equivalent dependent variables were applied to three cohorts of students. Cohort 1 represented the contrast group who followed a traditional program. Cohort 2 was the main treatment group to whom the modified program was presented. Cohort 3 represented a comparison group that was also presented with the modified program over a shorter period.    Student data on learning approach, teaching efficacy and academic attributions were gathered from repeated administrations of the Study Process Questionnaire (Biggs, 1987b), Teacher Efficacy Scale (Gibson &amp; Dembo, 1984) and Multidimensional-Multiattributional Causality Scale (Lefcourt, 1991). In addition, reflective journals, field observations and transcripts of interviews undertaken at the beginning and conclusion of the course, were used to clarify students&#65533; approaches to learning and their responses to program modifications.     Analyses of learning approaches adopted by Cohorts 1 and 2 revealed that they both began their course predominantly using surface approaches. While students in Cohort 1 completed the course with approximately equal reliance on deep and surface approaches, students in Cohort 2 reported a predominant use of deep approaches on course completion. The relative impact of the modified learning context on students with differing approaches to learning in this cohort were further explained through qualitative data and cluster analyses. The partial replication of the study with Cohort 3, across the first three semesters of their program, produced similar effects to those obtained with Cohort 2.    The analyses conducted with teaching efficacy data indicated a similar pattern of development for all cohorts. Little change in either personal or general dimensions was noted in the first half of the program, followed by strong growth in both, in the latter half. While a relationship between learning approach usage and teaching efficacy was not apparent in Cohort 1, developmental path and mediation analyses indicated that the use of deep learning approaches considerably influenced the development of personal teaching efficacy in Cohort 2.     The current research suggests that value lies in the construction of learning environments, in teacher education, that enhance students&#65533; adoption of deep learning approaches. The nature of the task is complex, multifaceted and context specific, most likely requiring the development of unique solutions in each environment. Nevertheless, this research demonstrates that such solutions can be developed and applied within the prevailing constraints of pre-existing course structures.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning approach;deep learning;surface learning;adapted learning methods;locus of control;teaching efficacy;personal efficacy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forward dynamic modelling of cycling for  people with spinal cord injury.</field><field name="creator">Sinclair, Peter James</field><field name="description">A forward dynamic model was developed to predict the performance of Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) individuals cycling an isokinetic ergometer using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to elicit contractions of the quadriceps, hamstring and gluteal muscles. Computer simulations were performed using three inter-connected models: a kinematic model of segmental linkages, a muscle model predicting forces in response to stimulation, and a kinetic model predicting ergometer pedal forces resulting from muscle stimulation.    Specific model parameters for SCI individuals were determined through measurements from isometric and isokinetic contractions of the quadriceps muscles elicited using surface stimulation. The muscle model was fitted to data resulting from these isolated experiments in order to tailor the model's parameters to characteristics of muscles from SCI individuals. Isometric data from a range of knee angles were used to fit tendon slack lengths to the rectus femoris and vastus muscles. Adjustments to the quadriceps moment arm function were not able to improve the match between measured and modelled knee extension torques beyond those using moment arms taken from available literature. Similarly, literature values for constants from the muscle force - velocity relationship provided a satisfactory fit to the decline in torque with angular velocity, and parameter fitting did not improve this fit. Passive visco-elastic resistance remained constant for all velocities of extension except the highest (240 deg/s). Since knee angular velocities this high were not experienced during cycling, a visco-elastic dampener was not included within the present cycling model.    The rise and fall in torque following NMES onset and cessation were used to fit constants to match the rate of change in torque. Constants for the rise in torque following NMES onset were significantly altered by changes in knee angle, with more extended angles taking longer for torque to rise. This effect was small, however, within the range of angles used during cycling, and consequently was not included within the cycling model. The decline in torque after NMES cessation was not affected by knee angle. A period of five minutes cyclical isometric activity of the quadriceps resulted in torque declining by more than 75% from rested levels. The activation time constants were largely unaffected by this fatigue, however, with only a small increase in the time for torque to decline, and no change in rise time or the delay between stimulation changes and resulting torque changes. The cycling model, therefore, did not incorporate any effect for changes in activation timing with fatigue.    Performance of the full model was evaluated through measurements taken from SCI individuals cycling a constant velocity ergometer using NMES elicited contractions of the quadriceps, hamstring and gluteal muscles. Pedal transducers measured forces applied to the pedals for comparison between measured and modelled values. A five minute period of continuous cycling using just the quadriceps muscles produced similar results to those found for isolated knee extension. External power output dropped by 50% over the five-minute period, however there was no change in the pattern of torque production with fatigue.     Cycling experiments were conducted using single muscle groups across a range of NMES firing angles. Experimental protocols were designed to seek the firing angles for each muscle that maximised power output by that group. Changes in power output in response to firing angle changes were not large, however, in comparison to the effects of cumulative fatigue and inconsistent power output between trials. This lead to large uncertainties in the determination of those firing angles that maximised power output by each muscle. Results suggest that NMES firing angles to maximise power output by the quadriceps muscles were relatively similar for each subject. For the hamstring muscles, however, substantial differences were observed in the range of firing angles that maximised power output. Results for the gluteal muscles were variable, with some subjects not applying any measurable torque to the cranks, even with maximal stimulation applied.     The model produced a good match to experimental data for the quadriceps muscles, both in the shape of pedal force curves and the firing angles that maximised external power output. The individual variability in hamstring responses was not, however, predicted by the model. Modification of the relative size of the hamstrings' moment arms about the hip and knee substantially improved the match between measured and modelled data. Analysis of results suggests that individual variability in the relative size of these moment arms is a major cause of variation in individual's response to hamstring stimulation. There were apparent limitations in the model's ability to predict the shape of crank torques resulting from stimulation of the gluteus maximus muscle. It is suggested that further research be conducted to enable modelling of this muscle using a range of fibre lengths and moment arms.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer simulation;muscle mechanics;spinal cord injury;functional electrical stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Denying intimacy: the role of reason and institutional order in the lives of people with an intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Klotz, Jani Frances</field><field name="description">This thesis explores differences in the ways that intellectually disabled people are perceived, interpreted and related to within a Western context. Through a comparison of familial and institutionalised forms of relatedness, it examines the interrelation between these differences and the consequences that they have for either denying or acknowledging severely intellectually disabled people's capacities for sociality. Drawing on Carrithers' (1992) concept of sociality and mutuality, and Wittgenstein's (1953) notion of language games, the thesis analyses the means by which a meaningful and shared existence with intellectually disabled people can be negotiated and developed. Although limited and restricted in their capacities for symbolic expression, such people do have modalities of symbolic life upon which sociality can be built.  By analysing the symbolic practices utilised by my three profoundly intellectually disabled siblings, I seek to show how relationships across the difference of intellectual disability are able to be symbolically mediated and negotiated. I argue that it is necessary to engage in relations of mutual interdependence in order to even recognise and perceive these practices as purposeful and meaningful. The mutuality that ensues requires a level of intimacy, empathy and commitment that is not easily sustainable, but which is necessary for the maintenance of intellectually disabled people's existence as social beings. These intimate relations are contrasted with clinical and institutional forms of relatedness, both of which have been informed and shaped by a symbolic scheme of reason and normality. This symbolic scheme associates a capacity for reason with normal humanness, where reason is identified as particular abstract, linguistic, mental practices that are then deemed necessary for sociality. These are what intelligence tests measure, and it is through such assessments that intellectually disabled people are rendered asocial. The pathologising of intellectual disability as an abnormal embodiment, and the clinical tendency to search only for deficits in functioning and ability, has led to a denial or ignorance of intellectually disabled people's abilities to be the independent sustainers and authors of mutuality and sociality. I draw on my family's medical notes, records from the institution where two of my siblings were sent to live, as well as observations made during twelve months of fieldwork with a group of intellectually disabled people attending an activities centre, and either living in community group homes or with their families, to elucidate the ways in which such interpretations of intellectual disability become instituted into daily practice.  The instituting of training and management practices within day centres, group homes and institutions for the intellectually disabled are a consequence of the perception that intellectually disabled people have no capacity for sociality as they are. So too are the legal and structural obligations that inform the forms of relatedness that staff have with the intellectually disabled people with whom they work. These relations are based on separation and disengagement rather than mutuality and intimacy. The aim in these institutionalised environments is to instil in such people a range of normative social, domestic and vocational skills as though it is upon these that their capacity as social beings are dependent. As a result, the symbolic practices and dispositional behaviours through which intellectually disabled people express themselves are not recognised as such, nor are they engaged with. This undermines intellectually disabled people's capacity to be joint contributors to social life in a way which incorporates their differences rather than trying to transform them.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intellectual disability;disability studies;anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cave Aragonites of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Rowling, Jill</field><field name="description">Abstract    Aragonite is a minor secondary mineral in many limestone caves throughout the world.  It has been claimed that it is the second-most common cave mineral after  calcite (Hill &amp; Forti 1997).  Aragonite occurs as a secondary mineral in the vadose zone of some caves in New South Wales.  Aragonite is unstable in fresh water and usually reverts to calcite,  but it is actively depositing in some NSW caves.    A review of current literature on the cave aragonite problem showed that  chemical inhibitors to calcite deposition assist in the precipitation  of calcium carbonate as aragonite instead of calcite.  Chemical inhibitors work by physically blocking the positions on the calcite  crystal lattice which would have otherwise allowed calcite to develop into a  larger crystal.  Often an inhibitor for calcite has no effect on the aragonite crystal lattice,  thus aragonite may deposit where calcite deposition is inhibited.    Another association with aragonite in some NSW caves appears to be high  evaporation rates allowing calcite, aragonite and vaterite to deposit.  Vaterite is another unstable polymorph of calcium carbonate, which reverts to  aragonite and calcite over time.  Vaterite, aragonite and calcite were found together in cave sediments in areas  with low humidity in Wollondilly Cave, Wombeyan.    Several factors were found to be associated with the deposition of aragonite  instead of calcite speleothems in NSW caves.  They included the presence of ferroan dolomite, calcite-inhibitors (in  particular ions of magnesium, manganese, phosphate, sulfate and heavy metals),  and both air movement and humidity.    Aragonite deposits in several NSW caves were examined to determine  whether the material is or is not aragonite. Substrates to the aragonite  were examined, as was the nature of the bedrock.  The work concentrated on Contact Cave and Wiburds Lake Cave at Jenolan, Sigma  Cave, Wollondilly Cave and Cow Pit at Wombeyan and Piano Cave and Deep Hole  (Cave) at Walli.  Comparisons are made with other caves.  The study sites are all located in Palaeozoic rocks within the Lachlan Fold  Belt tectonic region.  Two of the sites, Jenolan and Wombeyan, are close to the western edge of the  Sydney Basin. The third site, Walli, is close to a warm spring.  The physical, climatic, chemical and mineralogical influences on calcium  carbonate deposition in the caves were investigated.  Where cave maps were unavailable, they were prepared on site as part of the  study.    %At Jenolan Caves, Contact Cave and Wiburds Lake Cave were examined in detail,  %and other sites were compared with these.  Contact Cave is located near the eastern boundary of the Late Silurian Jenolan  Caves Limestone, in an area of steeply bedded and partially dolomitised  limestone very close to its eastern boundary with the Jenolan volcanics.  Aragonite in Contact Cave is precipitated on the ceiling as anthodites,  helictites and coatings.  The substrate for the aragonite is porous, altered, dolomitised limestone which  is wedged apart by aragonite crystals.  Aragonite deposition in Contact Cave is associated with a concentration of  calcite-inhibiting ions, mainly minerals containing ions of magnesium,  manganese and to a lesser extent, phosphates.  Aragonite, dolomite and rhodochrosite are being actively deposited where these  minerals are present.  Calcite is being deposited where minerals containing magnesium ions are not  present.  The inhibitors appear to be mobilised by fresh water entering the cave  as seepage along the steep bedding and jointing.  During winter, cold dry air pooling in the lower part of the cave may  concentrate minerals by evaporation and is most likely associated with the  ``popcorn line'' seen in the cave.    Wiburds Lake Cave is located near the western boundary of the Jenolan Caves  Limestone, very close to its faulted western boundary with Ordovician cherts.  Aragonite at Wiburds Lake Cave is associated with weathered pyritic dolomitised  limestone, an altered, dolomitised mafic dyke in a fault shear zone,  and also with bat guano minerals.  Aragonite speleothems include a spathite, cavity fills, vughs, surface coatings  and anthodites.  Calcite occurs in small quantities at the aragonite sites.  Calcite-inhibitors associated with aragonite include ions of magnesium,  manganese and sulfate.  Phosphate is significant in some areas.  Low humidity is significant in two areas.    Other sites briefly examined at Jenolan include Glass Cave, Mammoth Cave,  Spider Cave and the show caves.  Aragonite in Glass Cave may be associated with both weathering of dolomitised  limestone (resulting in anthodites) and with bat guano (resulting in small  cryptic forms).  Aragonite in the show caves, and possibly in Mammoth and Spider Cave is  associated with weathering of pyritic dolomitised limestone.    Wombeyan Caves are developed in saccharoidal marble, metamorphosed Silurian  Wombeyan Caves Limestone.  Three sites were examined in detail at Wombeyan Caves: Sigma Cave, Wollondilly  Cave and Cow Pit (a steep sided doline with a dark zone).  Sigma Cave is close to the south east boundary of the Wombeyan marble,  close to its unconformable boundary with effusive hypersthene porphyry and  intrusive gabbro, and contains some unmarmorised limestone.  Aragonite occurs mainly in a canyon at the southern extremity of the cave and  in some other sites.  In Sigma Cave, aragonite deposition is mainly associated with minerals  containing calcite-inhibitors, as well as some air movement in the cave.  Calcite-inhibitors at Sigma Cave include ions of magnesium, manganese,  sulfate and phosphate (possibly bat origin),  partly from bedrock veins and partly from breakdown of minerals in sediments  sourced from mafic igneous rocks.  Substrates to aragonite speleothems include corroded speleothem, bedrock,  ochres, mud and clastics.  There is air movement at times in the canyon, it has higher levels of CO2  than other parts of the cave and humidity is high.  Air movement may assist in the rapid exchange of CO2 at speleothem surfaces.    Wollondilly Cave is located in the eastern part of the Wombeyan marble.  At Wollondilly Cave, anthodites and helictites were seen in an inaccessible area  of the cave.  Paramorphs of calcite after aragonite were found at Jacobs Ladder and the  Pantheon.  Aragonite at Star Chamber is associated with huntite and hydromagnesite.  In The Loft, speleothem corrosion is characteristic of bat guano deposits.  Aragonite, vaterite and calcite were detected in surface coatings in this area.  Air movement between the two entrances of this cave has a drying effect which  may serve to concentrate minerals by evaporation in some parts of the cave.  The presence of vaterite and aragonite in fluffy coatings infers that vaterite  may be inverting to aragonite.  Calcite-inhibitors in the sediments include ions of phosphate, sulphate,  magnesium and manganese.  Cave sediment includes material sourced from detrital mafic rocks.    Cow Pit is located near Wollondilly Cave, and cave W43 is located near the  northern boundary of the Wombeyan marble.  At Cow Pit, paramorphs of calcite after aragonite occur in the walls as  spheroids with minor huntite.  Aragonite is a minor mineral in white wall coatings and red phosphatic  sediments with minor hydromagnesite and huntite.  At cave W43, aragonite was detected in the base of a coralloid speleothem.  Paramorphs of calcite after aragonite were observed in the same speleothem.  Dolomite in the bedrock may be a source of magnesium-rich minerals at cave W43.    Walli Caves are developed in the massive Belubula Limestone of the Ordovician  Cliefden Caves Limestone Subgroup (Barrajin Group).  At the caves, the limestone is steeply bedded and contains chert nodules with  dolomite inclusions.  Gypsum and barite occur in veins in the limestone.  At Walli Caves, Piano Cave and Deep Hole (Deep Cave) were examined for  aragonite.  Gypsum occurs both as a surface coating and as fine selenite needles on chert  nodules in areas with low humidity in the caves.  Aragonite at Walli caves was associated with vein minerals and coatings  containing calcite-inhibitors and, in some areas, low humidity.  Calcite-inhibitors include sulfate (mostly as gypsum), magnesium, manganese  and barium.    Other caves which contain aragonite are mentioned. Although these were not major  study sites, sufficient information is available on them to make a preliminary  assessment as to why they may contain aragonite.  These other caves include Flying Fortress Cave and the B4-5 Extension at  Bungonia near Goulburn, and Wyanbene Cave south of Braidwood.  Aragonite deposition at Bungonia has some similarities with that at Jenolan in  that dolomitisation of the bedrock has occurred, and the bedding or jointing  is steep allowing seepage of water into the cave, with possible oxidation  of pyrite. Aragonite is also associated with a mafic dyke.  Wyanbene cave features some bedrock dolomitisation, and also features low grade  ore bodies which include several known calcite-inhibitors.  Aragonite appears to be associated with both features.  Finally, brief notes are made of aragonite-like speleothems at Colong Caves  (between Jenolan and Wombeyan), a cave at Jaunter (west of Jenolan) and  Wellington (240\,km NW of Sydney).</field><field
