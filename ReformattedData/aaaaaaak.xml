andrographolide</field><field name="creator">Xu, Youhong</field><field name="description">Andrographis paniculata (AP) is a traditional herbal medicine which is widely used for the treatment of many diseases in Asia. Recently, various biological activities of AP extract or andrographolide (AND), such as immunostimulatory activity, anti-inflammatoryeffect, cytokine induction or deduction, a potential cancer therapeutic agent and T cell activation suppression, have been reported. However the potential ofAP extract or AND to stimulate the specific or adaptive immune response using microbial vaccines has not been determined. In this project, AND has been purifiedfrom AP and its identity confirmed by the melting point, colour test, TLC, UV absorption spectrum, ESI-MS and H-NMR. An aqueous and two ethanolic extracts ofAndrographis paniculata and AND, an active principle of Andrographis paniculata, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity against nine bacterial species in vitro using the disc diffusion method. It was discovered that neither the aqueous extract nor AND were bacteriostatic or bactericidal against S. typhimurium, E. coli, S. sonnei, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, L. pneumophila or B. pertussisbut the two ethanolic extracts of AP were bacteriostatic against L. pneumophila and B. pertussis. It was also observed that the ethanol extract of AP and AND stimulatedboth antibody and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses to a killed S. typhimurium vaccine. Mice were vaccinated with either one dose or two doses of killed S. typhimurium vaccine. They were fed two different quantities of an ethanol extract of AP or AND for 14 days in mice immunised with one dose of the vaccine, and for 28 days in mice immunised with two doses of vaccine, respectively. Both the extract and AND significantly increased the IgG antibody titres against S. typhimurium, with theincrease in antibody titres being statistically significant in the two dose vaccine group. Although not statistically significant, there was also a substantial increase in the IgG antibody titres in the one dose vaccine group. Splenocyte cultures from mice fromboth the immunisation groups treated with the extract or AND stimulated with the S. typhimurium lysate showed a significant increase in the production of IFN-&#947; in both14 and 28 day AP extract or AND treatment groups. The increase indicates the induction of a cell-mediated immune response. To confirm the immunomodulatory potential of AP extract and determine the immunomodulatory potential of AND, experiments were conducted using mouse salmonellosis as a model system. Mice were vaccinated with two doses of killed S. typhimurium vaccine by intraperitoneal(i/p) route and orally dosed with AP extract at 25 mg/kg bodyweight or AND at 4 mg/kg bodyweight for total 28 days, followed by oral challenge with virulent S. typhimurium. Both AP extract and AND substantially increased the survival rate by 50% after mice were challenged with 10 fold of a sublethal dose (1.5x10 6 cfu) of virulent S. typhimurium. They also promoted clearance of S. typhimurium from challenged mice by days 8 or 12 post-challenge with 1.5x10 cfu virulent S. typhimurium respectively. Sera IgG, IgA antibody titres against S. typhimurium and IFN-&#947; or IL-2 were detected after the mice were challenged by the oral route with a sublethal dose (1.5x10 cfu) of virulent S. typhimurium for 12 days. It was thus concluded that both Andrographis paniculata and AND not only elicited both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in the mouse model, but also increasedthe protective efficacy against salmonellosis on mice vaccinated with inactivated S. typhimurium. Therefore the ability of Andrographis paniculata and AND to promoteacquired immunity, particularly in inducing CMI may be important in protection against intracellular pathogen infection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Andrographis</field><field name="subject">paniculata;</field><field name="subject">andrographolide;</field><field name="subject">adaptive</field><field name="subject">immune</field><field name="subject">response</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00005134/</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and inclusion chemistry of diheteroaromatic compounds</field><field name="creator">Ashmore, Jason, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Diquinoline molecules have been shown previously to have interesting inclusion properties. Of the nine new, targeted molecules produced for this work, seven formed inclusion compounds, and their solid-state structures are discussed herein.  Chapter 2 shows the effect that substituting a hydrogen atom with a chlorine atom has on the inclusion properties. This comes about because of the additional intermolecular attractions that are now possible, and a wider range of guest molecules is included as a result. A new homochiral aromatic 'swivel offset face-face (OFF)' interaction is observed.  Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the effect of adding extra aromatic planes to the target molecules, two or four planes, respectively. Each of these host molecules formed dimeric host-host units that are extremely similar across all crystal structures. These dimers mainly employed aromatic edgeface (EF) interactions.  Chapter 5 looks at the effect of combining the modifications described in Chapters 2-4, namely additional aromatic surfaces and atom substitution. The resulting host molecule specifically includes polyhalomethane guests. In addition, this host molecule formed two concomitant pseudo-dimorph compounds with chloroform-d.  The diquinoline host molecule presented in Chapter 6 incorporated an isomeric central linker ring to the other compounds. Although only a single crystal structure could be obtained, 1H NMR spectroscopy experiments show other small aromatics may be included.  The effect of electron donating chemical substituents was examined in Chapter 7. These compounds were found to be quite insoluble, and did not produce crystals suitable for X-ray analysis.  The host molecules in Chapter 8 contain electron withdrawing nitro groups. The two isomeric compounds that act as inclusion hosts show quite different properties. One of these hosts forms a series of inclusion compounds with water, in which the site occupancy of the guest can range from 0-100% without change to the overall structure. All the X-ray structures described have been analysed in crystal engineering terms, and their supramolecular interactions described in detail.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clathrate compounds.</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds -- Synthesis.</field><field name="subject">Halogen.</field><field name="subject">Molecules structure.</field><field name="subject">Crystals -- Structure.</field><field name="subject">Quinoline</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40826</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laser Crystallisation of Silicon for Photovoltaic Applications using Copper Vapour Lasers</field><field name="creator">Boreland, Matt, School of Electrical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin film silicon on low temperature glass substrates is currently seen as the best path toreduce the $/W cost of photovoltaic (PV) modules. However, producing thin film polysilicon, on glass, is an ongoing research challenge. Laser crystallisation of a-Si is one of the possible methods.  Typically excimer (XMR) lasers are used for laser crystallisation. This thesis introduces the copper vapour laser (CVL) as a viable alternative for thin film photovoltaic applications. The CVL, like the XMR, is a high powered, pulsed laser. However, the CVL has higher pulse rates (4-20kHz), better beam quality and a visible wavelength output (578 &amp; 511nm). Preliminary experiments, using 600K-heated silicon-on-quartz samples, confirmed that CVL crystallisation can produce area weighted average grain size of 0.1-0.15??m, which is comparable to results reported for XMR??? s. Importantly, the CVL results used thicker films (1??m), which is more applicable to thin photovoltaic devices that need 1-10??m of silicon to be viable. The CVL??? s longer wavelength and therefore longer penetration depth (1/alpha) are proffered as the main reason for this result.  Extensive laser-thermal modelling highlighted further opportunities specific to CVL crystallisation. Through-the-glass doublesided irradiation was shown in simulations to reduce thermal gradients, which would enhance crystal growth. The simulations also produced deeper melts at lower surface temperatures, reducing the thermal stress on the sample. Subsequent experiments, using silicon-on-glass, confirmed the benefit of through-the-glass doublesided irradiation by maintaining grain sizes without the usual need for substrate heating. Furthermore, Raman analysis showed that doublesided crystallisation achieved full depth crystallisation, unlike single side irradiation which produced partial crystallisation.  A new mode of crystallisation, stepwise crystallisation, was also postulated whereby a series of CVL pulses could be used to incrementally increase the crystallisation depth into the silicon. Simulations confirmed the theoretical basis of the concept, with HeNe Raman spectroscopy and analysis of surface grain sizes providing indirect experimental support.  The CVL??? s ability to crystallise thicker films more directly applicable to photovoltaic devices secures its viability as an alternative laser for photovoltaic applications. The through-the-glass doublesided irradiation and the stepwise crystallisation provide additional potential for increased process flexibility over XMR???s.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="subject">laser crystallisation</field><field name="subject">copper vapour laser</field><field name="subject">laser thermal modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17190</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular characterisation of sol-gel biocatalysts</field><field name="creator">Rodgers, Lisa Elizabeth, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sol-gel matrices may be used to immobilise enzymes, facilitating retention of the catalyst while allowing a flow of substrates and products through the matrix. Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB), a commonly used industrial enzyme, has been shown to have a prolonged catalytic life and enhanced activity when encapsulated in these sol-gel materials. However, the molecular basis for this effect had yet to be elucidated. This study investigated the effect of encapsulating CALB in sol-gel matrices by comparison of CALB in solution with its encapsulated form. Use of complementary techniques revealed the presence of complex interactions between the enzyme and the evolving sol-gel material. 29Si Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements demonstrated that CALB influenced sol-gel structure by altering silica speciation. Inclusion of CALB also altered the mesoporosity of the matrices as determined using nitrogen sorption and electron microscopy. Correlation of activity assays with 29Si speciation changes indicated that the catalytic activity of the enzyme in solution was directly involved in sol-gel hydrolysis and condensation reactions. Increased specific activity of CALB in the sol-gel aqueous precursor solution resulted in measurable changes in the gel structure of matrices containing 3.1mg of CALB/ml of gel. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was used to examine the structure of CALB in solution. The influence of the sol-gel reactants glycerol, sodium fluoride and isopropanol upon the radius of gyration of CALB in solution was determined. SANS was also employed in an investigation of encapsulated CALB molecules which utilised contrast matching of the sol-gel matrix. However, contrast variation studies found that the match point for the silica matrix, both with and without enzyme present, was lower than predicted (~35% vol% D2O). Consequently, the contrast match point of the protein was close to that of the encapsulating material. Scattering from the encapsulated protein at this point was therefore minimal; it is clear that the contrast match point of the protein should be moved through in vivo deuteration in future experiments of this type. These investigations advance the understanding of interactions between the matrix and the encapsulated enzyme in sol-gel biomaterials.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26809</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function of the signaling protein Ras guanine releasing protein 4 (RasGRP4) in human mast cells</field><field name="creator">Katsoulotos, Gregory Peter, St George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of both atopic and non-atopic asthma. Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing protein 4 (RasGRP4) is a mast cell-restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor and diacylglycerol (DAG)/ phorbol ester receptor whose function has not been deduced. RT-PCR analysis of 40 asthmatic patients and 40 non-asthmatic controls demonstrated a higher hRasGRP4 mRNA expression in a subgroup of the asthmatics. A RasGRP4-defective variant of the human mast cell line HMC-1 was used to create stable clones expressing green fluorescent protein-labeled human RasGRP4 for monitoring the movement of this signaling protein inside mast cells before and after exposure to phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and for evaluating the protein???s ability to control the development, phenotype, and function of mast cells. Transcript-profiling approaches revealed hRasGRP4 constitutively regulates the expression of numerous genes in the HMC-1 cell line. For example, expression of hRasGRP4 in HMC-1 cells substantially decreased GATA-1 levels without altering GATA-2 levels, suggesting that hRasGRP4 regulates mast cell commitment of multipotential progenitors in part by controlling the intracellular levels of at least one lineage-dependent transcription factor for hematopoietic cells. hRasGRP4 resided primarily in the cytosol before HMC-1 cells were stimulated with PMA. After exposure to PMA, hRasGRP4 translocated to the inner leaflet of the cell???s plasma membrane and then to perinuclear and Golgi compartments. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 were activated during this translocation process, and the PMA-treated cells transiently increased their expression of the transcripts encoding the interleukin 13 receptor IL-13R??2 and numerous other proteins. The accumulated data in our mast cell model suggest hRasGRP4 translocates to various intracellular compartments via its DAG/PMA-binding domain to regulate those signaling pathways that allow mast cells to respond quickly to changes in their tissue microenvironments.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interleukins</field><field name="subject">Cytokines</field><field name="subject">Ras proteins</field><field name="subject">Mast cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27341</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Magneto-optical Study of the Electromagnetic Properties of High-temperature Superconductors</field><field name="creator">Lin, Zhi Wei, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A magneto-optical apparatus has been designed to investigate flux and current distributions in various forms of high-temperature superconductor after the application of external magnetic fields, transport currents, and both in sequence. It is concluded that flux motion depends significantly on the superconductor characteristic flux pinning strength and geometry. The flux profiles at the surface of an isolated thin film strip, and thin films in x-array and shunted-x-array arrangements have been studied in detail. It has been found that the theoretical flux profile, characterised by a logarithmic singularity at its edges and a vertical slope at the flux front, become rounded when the sample thickness is taken into account. Experiment has confirmed that the current density reaches its critical value in the flux-penetrated region while there is a continuous non-zero current density in the central flux-free region. Also magnetic interactions exist between the strips. Band-shaped and dome-shaped flux distributions caused by geometrical barrier at different weak pinning strengths were observed in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x single crystals between 20 K and 70 K. The geometrical barrier also governs the transport current leading to a square-shaped distribution near the crystal edges at 20 K. Cracks and defects in Bi-2223/Ag tapes were visualised without destruction of the tape. The inhomogeneous flux distribution indicated that defects, including cracks, in superconducting filaments limit the current-carrying capacity of the tape. In addition, at 70 K a fraction of the transport current has been found to flow in the silver sheath. An investigation of the influence of the twin planes on vortex motion in a YBa2Cu3O7-d single crystal has shown that after a twin barrier is initially overcome, the twin planes, regardless of their directions, act as an easy-flow channel for vortex penetration at low temperatures as the pinning strength in the twin planes is weaker than that in the untwinned region, whereas, they act as a barrier at high temperatures where the pinning strength in the twin planes is stronger. Furthermore, vortex penetration along the twin planes is a factor of four greater than that for the untwinned region at 25 K.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High temperature superconductors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17456</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective attention in human causal learning and recognition memory</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Oren Dennis, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">It was hypothesized that similar selective attention processes might underlie two important empirical phenomena from traditionally distinct fields of cognitive psychology; the effect of divided attention on memory, and the blocking effect in associative learning. To investigate this hypothesis, ten experiments were conducted to investigate the role of selective attention in recognition and causal learning. In order to do so, a new category-based causal judgment task was constructed (Chapter 1), which allowed measurement of both causal strength and cue recognition. This procedure was then used to examine the blocking effect, in which pre-training with one cue, A, typically results in impaired learning about a second cue, B, when those two cues are trained in compound (AB+). Participants also demonstrated decreased recognition performance for the causally redundant cue B, suggesting that less attention had been paid to it in training (Chapter 3). Neither blocking in recognition, nor in causal judgment, was influenced by an additivity manipulation (Chapter 4). These results are consistent with the idea that attention is preferentially allocated towards the more predictive cue A, and away from the less predictive cue B (e.g., Mackintosh, 1975). Contrary to this hypothesis, poorer recognition was observed for predictive cues than for novel, or unreliable predictors (Chapter 5). Finally, in Chapter 6, a dissociation was observed between memory encoding and the rate at which causal learning occurred; participants learned more rapidly about previously predictive cues (e.g. A) than previously non-predictive cues (e.g. E), but demonstrated equivalently poor recognition for both types of cues (e.g. A and E). In Chapter 7, the present data are discussed in relation to models of associative learning, categorization and memory. A new model, based upon Mackintosh (1975) and Kruschke (1992) is proposed to account for the observed relationship between the extent to which each cue is attended to, learned about and later recognized.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42780</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Freedom to worship: frameworks for the realisation of religious minority rights</field><field name="creator">Ngui, Samantha, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A comparative study of the development of places of worship in Sydney was conducted primarily through the collection of data from development applications to construct or to use premises as a place of worship over a five year period from 2000-2005. The data indicated that a greater and disproportionately higher number of applications by religious minorities were rejected. The significance of the findings does not lie exclusively in identifying the likelihood of development applications gaining approval. The process of determining development applications and the impacts of the outcome of the process were also important. This is why the content of the objections raised to development applications was analysed. The underlying themes in the opposition to development applications related strongly to citizenship, particularly how the boundaries of local forms of citizenship are negotiated. In establishing places of worship religious groups seek to have their citizenship claims recognised. These citizenship claims include: the right to access, mark and use space (Dunn 2005), equality of citizenship with local residents and with other religious groups, and importantly, the right to freedom of worship. One of the main assertions made in this thesis is that by restricting access to sites that people can worship and by restricting the practice of religion, the right to freedom of worship is compromised. Churches dominate the religious landscape of Sydney. This dominance can be partially attributed to the significant levels of historical assistance from the state with the building of Churches. This included access to land, free labour, support for clergy and income support which assisted in the development of early Churches. The appropriateness of giving this type of assistance is not debated in this thesis. However, the assistance itself is significant for two main reasons. Firstly it is emblematic of the privileged relationship between the Church and the state in Australia, and secondly, it raises questions over the lack of privileges afforded to religious minorities. In responding to the question of whether secularism is likely to assist religious minorities, the establishment of places of worship demonstrates how pluralising the Church state link may be of greater utility to religious minorities than strict forms of secularism. The examination of this issue introduces the importance of an equal relationship between the state and religious groups to equality of citizenship for religious minorities. The extent to which multicultural citizenship can assist religious minorities in realising their right to freedom of worship was critically examined in this thesis. The adequacy of the institutional responses to religious diversity was assessed. This included an examination of local government, courts, the media, heritage programs and the planning profession. The planning process demonstrates how a supposedly neutral or colour-blind approach can generate uneven outcomes, which discriminate against religious minorities. The broader policy and legislative responses to religious diversity were examined in order to identify how deficiencies in the multicultural framework contributed to difficulties for religious minorities establishing places of worship.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place of worship</field><field name="subject">Secularism</field><field name="subject">Religious minorities</field><field name="subject">Multicultural citizenship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42969</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">vNUMA: Virtual shared-memory multiprocessors</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Matthew, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Shared memory systems, such as SMP and ccNUMA topologies, simplify programming and administration.  On the other hand, systems without hardware support for shared memory, such as clusters of commodity workstations, are commonly used due to cost and flexibility considerations.  In this thesis, virtualisation is proposed as a technique that can bridge the gap between these architectures.  The resulting system, vNUMA, is a hypervisor with a unique feature: it provides the illusion of shared memory across separate nodes on a fast network.  This allows a cluster of workstations to be transformed into a single shared memory multiprocessor, supporting existing operating systems and applications.  Such an approach could also have applications for emerging highly-parallel architectures, allowing a shared memory programming model to be retained while reducing hardware complexity.  To build such a system, it is necessary to meld both a high-performance hypervisor and a high-performance distributed shared memory (DSM) system.  This thesis addresses the challenges inherent in both of these tasks.  First, designing an efficient hypervisor layer is considered; since vNUMA is implemented on the Itanium processor architecture, this is with particular reference to Itanium processor virtualisation.  Then, novel DSM protocols are developed that allow SMP consistency models to be reproduced while providing better performance than a simple atomically-consistent DSM system.  Finally, the system is evaluated, proving that it can provide good performance and compelling advantages for a variety of applications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DSM</field><field name="subject">virtualisation</field><field name="subject">hypervisor</field><field name="subject">ccNUMA</field><field name="subject">cluster</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42594</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the SiN Deposition and effect of the hydrogenation on solid-phase crystallisation of evaporated thin-film silicon solar cells on glass</field><field name="creator">Sakano, Tomokazu, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">One of the poly-Si thin-film cells developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is the EVA cell. In this work, SiN films for EVA cells as an antireflection/barrier coating were investigated. In addition, the effect of hydrogenation pre-treatment of solid phase crystallisation (SPC) on grain size and open-circuit voltage (Voc) was investigated. The SiN films deposited by PECVD were examined for uniformity of the thickness and the refractive index of the films across the position of the samples in the PECVD deposition system. A spectrophotometric analysis was used to determine these film properties. It was found that these properties were very uniform over the deposition area. Good repeatability of the depositions was also observed. A series of SiN film depositions by reactive sputtering were also performed to optimize the deposition process. Parameters adjusted during the deposition were nitrogen flow rate, substrate bias, and substrate temperature. By investigating the deposition rate, refractive index, and surface roughness of the films, the three deposition parameters were optimised. The effects of post SiN deposition treatments (a-Si deposition, SPC, RTA, and hydrogenation) on thickness and refractive index of both SiN films deposited by PECVD and reactive sputtering were investigated by using samples which have the same structure as the EVA cells. The thickness of the PECVD SiN films decreased about 6 % after all the treatments. On the other hand, the thickness reductions of the reactively sputtered SiN films were very small. The refractive index of the PECVD SiN films increased about 0.6 % after the treatments, whereas that of the reactively sputtered SiN films decreased 1.3 % after the treatments. As a possible method to improve the performance of EVA cells, hydrogenation of a-Si was investigated as a pre-treatment of SPC process. There were no obvious differences in the grainsize and the Voc of the EVA cells with and without the hydrogenation. Therefore it is likely that the hydrogenation pre-treatment of SPC does not have a beneficial effect on the performance of EVA cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrogenation</field><field name="subject">Thin-film solar cells</field><field name="subject">Poly-Si</field><field name="subject">Solid phase crystallisation</field><field name="subject">SiN</field><field name="subject">Silicon nitride</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42134</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of titanium dioxide thin films</field><field name="creator">Gan, Wee Yong, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based thin film photocatalysts of different morphologies were synthesized and studied for their photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties. The superhydrophilicity of selected TiO2 films were also assessed. The work started with the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films with minimal porosity. A photoelectrocatalytic study was performed to evaluate the films?? photocurrent response in the presence of various organic compounds. At low concentrations, the amount of photocurrent generated was found to be influenced by the molecular structure of the organic compounds. As the concentration increased, the photocurrent response became dependent on the level of interaction of the organic compounds and their partially degraded intermediates with the TiO2 surface. Highly dispersed platinum (Pt) were added onto TiO2 films by a photo-deposition method, and their photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities were assessed using a novel thin-layer photo(electrochemical)-catalytic system. The system allowed the photocurrent data that originated from the photoelectrocatalysis process to be collected in the reaction cell, and the amount of organic compound being oxidized to be quantified. The Pt deposits were found to enhance photocatalysis by increasing the photogenerated charge-carriers separation, but conversely they retarded the photoelectrocatalysis process. The next part of the work covered the development of mesoporous TiO2 films via the evaporative-induced self-assembly procedure. The structural characteristics of the films were altered by controlling the relative humidity and temperature during the coating and thermal treatment processes. The effect of key structural parameters, such as film porosity, surface area and crystallinity, on the photoelectrocatalytic activity was investigated. These parameters were found to affect the photoelectrocatalysis because the performance of a catalyst in the photoelectrocatalysis application relies strongly on attributes such as the photocatalyst particles?? interconnectivity and the contact to the conducting substrate. The last part of this thesis demonstrated the effort undertaken to improve the UV-induced superhydrophilic effect of a TiO2 film. A multilayer structure of TiO2 nanoparticles was assembled to create a novel TiO2 film that required no UV-activation to induce a uniform water sheeting across its surface. The novel TiO2 thin film exhibited stable superhydrophilic wetting and anti-fogging behaviors after repetitive cycles of heat and wetting treatment, and this performance was affected by the porosity and surface hydroxyl (-OH) contents.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Thin film</field><field name="subject">Photoelectrocatalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43310</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolutionary consequences of sexual conflict</field><field name="creator">Hall, Matthew, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The difference in evolutionary interests of males and females can select for traits that favour an individual??s fitness at the expense of their mate??s lifetime fitness. Despite the widespread occurrence of this sexual conflict over reproductive interactions, however, research to date has largely focused on the fitness costs imposed on females by manipulative males. Empirical evidence is particularly sparse for how mating can also be costly for males, the genetic structure of traits involved in reproductive interactions, and how sexual conflict can modify sexual selection in general. My aim was to explore the broader evolutionary consequence of sexual conflict and male-female interactions. In the nuptial-feeding Australian ground cricket, Pteronemobius sp., I used an experimental evolution approach to explore how diet and sexual conflict interact to determine the costs of mating.  In the Australian black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, I used molecular and quantitative genetic approaches to characterise the fitness consequences and genetic basis of spermatophore attachment, a trait at the centre of inter-locus sexual conflict, and then related this to both condition and male attractiveness. Finally, in T. commodus, I quantified how sexual conflict alters the sexual selection acting on male sexual traits and how this in turn shapes genetic architecture and the persistence of additive genetic variance. My results demonstrate the complex nature of reproductive interactions between males and females. Importantly, I show that diet can mediate the expression of sexual conflict in a mating system and shape the evolution of male life-span. I also show that reproductive interactions influence the fitness benefits that both male and females obtain from mating in ways that are not predicted by current theory and that much of the potential for such traits to co-evolve is via a common genetic association with condition. Finally, I demonstrate that sexual conflict can profoundly modify the process and outcome of sexual selection, thereby influencing how additive genetic variation is maintained in a suite of male sexual traits. These results highlight the need for a greater integration of sexual conflict and sexual selection theory as the evolutionary potential and significance of sexual conflict may currently be underestimated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantitative Genetics</field><field name="subject">Sexual Conflict</field><field name="subject">Sexual Selection</field><field name="subject">Life-history Tradeoffs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41284</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for transiting extrasolar planets with the automated patrol telescope</field><field name="creator">Hidas, M??rton Gergely, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past decade some 150 planets have been detected outside our Solar System, mostly via precise radial-velocity measurements of their host stars.

It requires intensive photometric monitoring of ??? 104 stars, with a precision better than ??? 1%. The 0.5 m Automated Patrol Telescope (APT) at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, with its wide field of view and large aperture, is ideal for this task.

In this thesis work, observing, data reduction and analysis procedures were developed for the project. A significant fraction of the initial effort was focused on reaching the required photometric precision. This was achieved by implementing a new observing technique, and robust data reduction software. In the first two years of regular observations (starting in August 2002), 8 crowded Galactic fields were monitored, with photometric precision reaching 0.2% for the brightest stars. We searched the lightcurves of the brightest stars (V &amp;lt13) and selected 5 planet candidates. Follow-up photometry and spectroscopy revealed all of these to be eclipsing binary stars. To date, no planets have been detected by this project. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the observations, using the currently known frequency and properties of extrasolar planets, resulted in a low calculated detection rate, consistent with the lack of detections. Using this simulation, we have investigated the observational and target star/planet parameters that determine the sensitivity of transit searches. The results highlighted the factors limiting our detection rate, and allowed us to significantly improve our observing strategy. According to the simulations, we should now detect ??? 2 planets per year. This will increase by a factor of a few when a new camera, currently under construction, is installed on the APT in early 2006.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22803</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cruiser and PhoTable: Exploring Tabletop User Interface Software for Digital Photograph Sharing and Story Capture</field><field name="creator">Apted, Trent Heath</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tabletop interface</field><field name="subject">surface computing</field><field name="subject">photo sharing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4207</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of condylar kinematics</field><field name="creator">Peck, Christopher</field><field name="description">Master of Science</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mandibular condyle</field><field name="subject">Temporomandibular joint -- Range of motion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4208</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An electromyographic study of the human jaw-closing reflex</field><field name="creator">Murray, Gregory Michael</field><field name="description">Master of Science</field><field name="date">1983</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jaws -- Muscles</field><field name="subject">Reflexes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4210</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ensuring Serializable Executions with Snapshot Isolation DBMS</field><field name="creator">Alomari, Mohammad</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concurrency Control, Serializability, Correctness, Snapshot Isolation, Multiversion concurrency control, performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4211</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The distribution, biosynthetic origin and functional significance of Tyrian purple precursors in the Australian muricid Dicathais orbita (Neogastropoda: Muricidae)</field><field name="creator">Westley, Chantel Barbara</field><field name="description">Information on the biosynthetic origin and functional advantage of marine mollusc natural products is not only essential to our understanding of chemical ecology, but to the development and responsible production of therapeutic agents. As demonstrating in situ activity is methodologically hindered, functions inferred by in vitro activity have been assumed for many secondary metabolites. The anatomical and ontogenetic distribution of natural products can not only provide information on the biosynthesis and storage of metabolites, but identify selective pressures likely to affect survivorship at a specific life stage. Thus, dissection and chemical analysis of distinct tissues, in combination with histochemistry may offer a valuable approach. 
Marine gastropods of the Muricidae are renowned for the ancient dye Tyrian purple, which evolves from choline esters of bromoindoxyl sulphate in the hypobranchial gland through a series of enzymatic and photo-oxidative reactions. Prochromogen hydrolysis by arylsulphatase liberates neuromuscular active choline esters and cytotoxic bromoindole precursors, which also occur in muricid egg masses. Although visual accounts of dye pigments in the muricid gonoduct suggest precursors may be incorporated into egg masses from a maternal source, their biosynthetic origin and the evolutionary significance of the hypobranchial gland is unknown. Thus, the Muricidae, and in particular Dicathais orbita upon which most previous research has been focused, is an ideal model for this novel approach to natural product research. 
To confirm observations of dye pigments in muricid gonoducts and gain an understanding of their anatomical distribution, a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method was developed to simultaneously quantify pigments, precursors and the prochromogen, tyrindoxyl sulfate. The prochromogen was not only detected in albumen and capsule gland extracts, but bioactive intermediates and the dye 6,6&#146;-dibromoindigo were also present in the latter. These findings provided preliminary evidence for the maternal provision of prochromogens in egg masses of D. orbita and identified regions within which to conduct histochemical investigations. Tyrindoxyl sulphate was also detected in male prostate gland extracts, along with the dibromoindigo isomer, 6,6&#146;-dibromoindirubin and its oxidative precursor, 6-bromoisatin. This not only implies physiological differences exist between male and female gonoducts, but that these secondary metabolites are not solely intended for egg masses and may hold significance throughout the life cycle.  
Histomorphological inspection of the pallial gonoduct-hypobranchial gland complex was conducted over the annual cycle to determine a mechanism for precursor transfer between these structures. Although an anatomical connection was not detected, the secretions of two hypobranchial cell types thought to be involved in Tyrian purple synthesis were of remarkable biochemical similarity to those of various capsule and albumen gland lobes. Together these findings implied the potential for natural product synthesis within the pallial gonoduct of D. orbita. 
To establish the role of these glandular lobes in the incorporation of intracapsular fluid and capsule laminae, identical histochemical techniques were applied to transverse capsule wall sections. Biochemical correlations not only provided a simple method of deciphering the complex process of encapsulation in neogastropods, but effectively identified the destination of gonoduct secretions in egg capsules of D. orbita. Comparisons of capsule and gonoduct biochemistry revealed that the intracapsular fluid and inner capsule wall are secreted by the posterior capsule gland lobe, the middle lamina by the lateral lobes and the outer layers by the dorsal lobe, albumen and pedal glands. 
Investigation into the location of regulatory enzymes and precursors was conducted to establish the biosynthetic origin of Tyrian purple prochromogens and mechanisms governing bioactive precursor synthesis. Novel histochemical techniques for the localization of bromoperoxidase, the enzyme thought to facilitate prochromogen bromination, and tyrindoxyl sulphate were developed and applied to gonoduct, hypobranchial gland, and encapsulated larvae sections. Standard staining reactions for the indole precursor, tryptophan, and arylsulphatase were also applied. The histochemical approach adopted revealed that tyrindoxyl sulphate is de novo biosynthesized through the post-translational bromination of dietary derived tryptophan. Two biosynthetic sites were identified, one related to hypobranchial secondary metabolism and the second of significance to the presence of bioactive precursors in muricid egg masses. 
Tryptophan is stored within secretory cells of the lateral hypobranchial epithelium and once exocytosed, is united with bromoperoxidase from supportive cells to form tyrindoxyl sulphate. Prochromogen synthesis also occurs in the subepithelial vascular sinus for storage and secretion by medial hypobranchial secretory cells. Bioactive precursor synthesis on the epithelial surface is regulated by the liberation of arylsulphatase from adjacent supportive cells. These findings not only provide evidence for de novo biosynthesis of Tyrian purple precursors, but are first account of natural product biosynthesis within the gastropod hypobranchial gland. Together these findings imply a naturally selected function for the synthesis of bioactive indoles in hypobranchial gland secretions of the Muricidae and Gastropoda. 
Tyrindoxyl sulphate is also transported within the vascular sinus to lateral and dorsal capsule gland lobes where bromoperoxidase and arylsulphatase also occur. Arylsulphatase was also detected within the albumen gland, which along with the posterior capsule gland lobe, acts as a storage site for dietary tryptophan. Thus, tyrindoxyl sulphate and the constituents for prochromogen and precursor biosynthesis are introduced to intracapsular fluid and capsule laminae by the capsule gland. Histochemistry in combination with LC-MS revealed an identical biosynthetic profile within larval vitellus, which is elaborated during oogenesis and may also receive secretions from the albumen gland. Due to the absence of a hypobranchial gland in veligers, it appears that pelagic larvae rely on vitelline natural products until settlement and metamorphous. These findings together with the in situ antimicrobial activity of bromoindoles suggest Tyrian purple precursors are incorporated into muricid egg masses as a maternal investment in larval defence against pathogens. 
The results of this investigation clearly highlight the benefits of adopting a histochemical approach to natural product research. This novel alternative to radioisotopes and in situ demonstration of bioactivity, can not only aid in the elucidation of secondary metabolic pathways and chemically mediated interactions, but identify mechanisms of metabolite regulation and differentiate between biosynthetic and storage tissues. Apart from providing insight into the ecological significance of muricid secondary metabolites, the biosynthetic information provided is valuable to our understanding of chemical phylogeny and biosynthetic enzyme sequencing for the environmentally sound development of natural products as biomedical agents.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Muricidae</field><field name="subject">Neogastropoda</field><field name="subject">Tyrian purple</field><field name="subject">marine natural product</field><field name="subject">de novo biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">bromoperoxidase</field><field name="subject">arylsulphatase</field><field name="subject">tyrindoxyl sulphate</field><field name="subject">hypobranchial gland</field><field name="subject">gonoduct</field><field name="subject">egg capsule</field><field name="subject">ingesting gland</field><field name="subject">albumen gland</field><field name="subject">seminal receptacle</field><field name="subject">sperm storage</field><field name="subject">larval chemical defence</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090414.153942</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving Forward Together in Aboriginal Women&#146;s Health:
A Participatory Action Research Exploring Knowledge Sharing, Working Together and Addressing Issues Collaboratively in Urban Primary Health Care Settings</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Janet</field><field name="description">This collaborative qualitative research explored ways of improving Aboriginal women&#146;s health and well-being in an urban Adelaide primary health care setting. This involved respectful knowledge sharing, working effectively together and addressing issues related to colonisation, discrimination and exclusion. It was identified that while Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal professionals are committed to &#145;Closing the Gap&#146; in health disparities, many have questioned how best to do so within the current health system. Therefore, this research focused on filling gaps in knowledge about the spaces where Aboriginal community women, and Aboriginal and non Aboriginal health professionals can work collaboratively regardful and regardless of health system polices, programs and practices. 
A strong commitment to local community preferences and national Aboriginal health research ethics enabled Aboriginal community women and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal heath professional co-researchers to be actively and meaningfully involved with me in both the research processes and outcomes. A modified Participatory Action Research (PAR), with repeated cycles of Look and Listen, Think and Discuss and Take Action emerged as an effective model of collaborative practice, suitable for health care and research. 
Four unique yet interconnected areas of collaboration developed, each highlighting particular aspects of culturally safe knowledge sharing and collaboration in health care. The first involved working with Aboriginal community women, acknowledging and addressing their most health and well-being priorities related to high levels of stress in their lives. Collaborative action involved creating a women&#146;s friendship group, seeking and accessing a range of services, and co-presenting our findings at conferences
The second Collaboration Area offers insights into the practicalities and difficulties experienced by staff as they tried to provide health services for Aboriginal women in a newly developing Aboriginal health organisation. The third Collaboration Area focused on the challenges and benefits of collaboration between sectors, in particular a local high school and the Aboriginal health service. We explored effective ways to work across sectors and engage young Aboriginal women in health programs. The ongoing impact of discrimination, exclusion and colonisation for this next generation of Aboriginal women was highlighted. The fourth Collaboration Area involved wider collaboration and road testing our collaborative methodology in a broader environment. A diverse group of co-researchers came together to plan, implement and evaluate a de-colonising national action research action learning conference embedded in Aboriginal preferred ways of knowing and doing. 
Findings are discussed under the three central themes of knowledge sharing, working together and addressing health care access and colonisation and key recommendations for the future are proposed. This research has reinforced the need identified in Aboriginal health documents for policy, program and practice commitment to holistic and collaborative approaches such as comprehensive primary health care and participatory action research. While the National Apology and Close the Gap campaign have provided opportunities for change, these need to be followed by tangible action at all levels of health care.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Aboriginal health</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">participatory action research</field><field name="subject">collaboration</field><field name="subject">women's health</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090324.084222</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced techniques for the upgrading of waste stabilisation pond effluent: rock filtration; duckweed; and attached-growth media</field><field name="creator">Short, Michael Douglas</field><field name="description">Waste Stabilisation Ponds (WSPs) are a relatively simplistic and non-intensive wastewater treatment technology; with various WSP configurations widely employed to treat a range of different wastewaters the world over. Whilst the advantages of WSP treatment are both numerous and well recognized, performance problems relating to the presence of occasionally large and unpredictable quantities of plankton (both algal and zooplankton) biomass in the final pond effluents have posed significant operational problems for WSP operators; with this suspended biomass representing the single biggest drawback associated with the technology. Research conducted during this project was concerned with assessing a selection of so-called &#145;advanced&#146; in-pond treatment processes for the upgrading or polishing of a final WSP effluent. The particular research emphasis was on the removal of problematic algal and zooplankton biomass from WSP effluent prior to Dissolved Air Flotation/Filtration (DAF/F) treatment and wastewater reuse at the Bolivar Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) north of Adelaide.

The in situ WSP upgrade systems assessed in this thesis were: the native floating plant &#145;Duckweed&#146; (DW); &#145;Rock Filters&#146; (RFs); and an artificial &#145;Attached-Growth Media&#146; (AGM); all of which were assessed for their relative treatment efficacies parallel to a non-interventional &#145;Open Pond&#146; (OP) system which served as an effective control. These performance comparisons were assessed on a pilot-scale using a custom made pilot treatment plant which was located at the Bolivar WWTP. Performance monitoring was periodically carried out over a 12 month period from July 2005&#150;August 2006, with algal and zooplankton populations monitored in addition to the more conventional wastewater quality parameters.

Results from pilot plant investigations demonstrated that of the four pilot upgrade series, the RF and AGM systems displayed the greatest treatment potential in terms of both the magnitude and reliability of suspended solids, algal and zooplankton biomass removals. The DW system was also shown to be at least as effective and in some instances significantly more advanced than the uncovered OP system in terms of its ability to significantly improve the final effluent quality of the Bolivar WSPs. Both the RF and AGM upgrades (and to a lesser degree also the DW system) were found to offer considerable potential for producing a higher quality WSP effluent for more efficient processing by the Bolivar DAF/F plant; although there were various operational advantages and disadvantages as well as varying capital establishment costs associated with each of the candidate technologies. This part of the research represented the first direct performance comparison between two popular pond upgrade technologies (i.e. RFs and DW) and also constituted the first assessment of a novel AGM for the upgrading of tertiary-level WSP effluent. In addition to this, results from ecological performance monitoring also provided the first detailed insights into algal and zooplankton population dynamics within these WSP upgrade environments.

In addition to these pilot-scale WSP upgrade performance investigations, another branch of the research project investigated additional research questions regarding the survival of algal cells within these pond upgrade environments. A series of laboratory experiments attempted to recreate the in situ conditions (in terms of light and oxygen availability) that might exist within the adopted upgrade environments. Using two common WSP algal species, long-term monitoring of the physiological status of phytoplankton cells during prolonged dark-exposure under conditions of reduced oxygen availability was performed in order to assess the likely effects of these particular environmental conditions on their survival potential in situ.

Results from these laboratory-based experiments showed that both algal species were capable of quickly adjusting their cellular metabolism in response to dark incubation. Results also showed that a reduced environmental oxygen concentration (25% of saturation) had no bearing on the ability of either Chlorella or Chlamydomonas species to withstand long-term dark-exposure; with both species retaining what was essentially full biological viability following up to two months of continuous dark-exposure. In an applied context, these results suggested that subjecting algal cells to conditions of simultaneous darkness and reduced oxygen availability would be expected to have no significant adverse effects on algal survivorship within an advanced in-pond upgrade system such as a duckweed-covered WSP, a rock filter or an AGM system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waste stabilisation pond</field><field name="subject">duckweed</field><field name="subject">rock filter</field><field name="subject">attached-growth media</field><field name="subject">algae</field><field name="subject">zooplankton</field><field name="subject">phytoplankton dark survival</field><field name="subject">flow hydraulics</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090408.141832</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating genetic population substructure of an Australian reptile tick, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers</field><field name="creator">Guzinski, Jaro</field><field name="description">Despite long-term study, the mechanism explaining the parapatric distribution of two Australian reptile ticks species, Bothriocroton hydrosauri and Amblyomma limbatum, is not understood. This project aimed to use molecular genetic data to investigate aspects of the population biology of these two tick species, such as population structure and dispersal, to gain further insights into the cause and maintenance of this parapatric boundary. I developed and subsequently tested for Mendelian inheritance a suite of B. hydrosauri and A. limbatum species-specific microsatellites markers. Pedigree analysis showed one B. hydrosauri locus and all of the A. limbatum loci to be inherited in a non-Mendelian manner. Thus I could not investigate A. limbatum population structure and focused solely on B. hydrosauri. 
The first part of this study tested predictions of a model formulated to explain B. hydrosauri transmission dynamics. The &#147;ripple&#148; model, based on detailed ecological and behavioural data on B. hydrosauri and Tiliqua rugosa, B. hydrosauri&#146;s most common host, predicts higher relatedness among larvae than among nymphs or adults on a host, and significant spatial autocorrelation in larvae extending further than for the later life stages. The model also predicts that adult ticks are likely to encounter related partners and that this will generate inbreeding within the population. I tested those predictions using nine microsatellite loci on a sample of 848 ticks (464 larvae, 140 nymphs and 244 adults) collected from 98 T. rugosa hosts at the northern edge of B. hydrosauri&#146;s distribution range. My data did support all of the predictions of the &#147;ripple&#148; model and indicated that the dynamics of transmission among hosts play an important role in parasite population structure. 
The second part of this project focused on investigating the population genetic structure of B. hydrosauri at the edge of its geographic range and testing the predictions of a population model derived to explain B. hydrosauri&#146;s parapatric boundary with A. limbatum. The &#147;ridge and trough&#148; model suggested the tick population was organised spatially into a series of &#147;ridges&#148; where tick density was high and &#147;troughs&#148; where it was low. Genetically, the expectation was to find clusters of more closely related individuals associated with the ridges. Cluster analysis of microsatellite allele frequencies and analysis of molecular variance of mitochondrial haplotype frequencies revealed the presence of four genetic clusters within a sample of 244 B. hydrosauri adults. As the highly genetically divergent clusters had overlapping distributions, and in some cases were syntopic, the genetic population structure predicted for these ticks by the &#147;ridge and trough&#148; model was not observed. Several explanations were considered for the observed B. hydrosauri genetic population structure, but syntopy of the clusters suggested that assortative mating is the most likely. I speculated that the clusters have formed in allopatry, when the environment was extremely heterogeneous, such that the ticks (and their hosts) were confined to isolated patches of high-quality habitat. Given sufficient time, this could have resulted in reproductive incompatibility between ticks occupying different patches. The population structure I uncovered indicates subsequent secondary recontact of divergent groups.
Although my study allowed for a better understanding of B. hydrosauri biology and population structure, the reasons for the parapatric distributions of B. hydrosauri and A. limbatum are still unclear. Further research should focus on investigating the population genetic structure of A. limbatum at the edge of its range, as well as on performing a larger-scale study of B. hydrosauri population genetic structure and a more detailed investigation of the applicability of the &#147;ridge and trough&#148; model to this tick species. Moreover, it will be useful to inspect the population structure of both these species within the centers of their ranges and compare these findings with population structure found at the edge of the range.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population genetics</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">reptile ticks</field><field name="subject">microsatellites</field><field name="subject">transmission dynamics</field><field name="subject">population structure</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090324.125811</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Full- Fee paying International Students at Murdoch University 1985 - 1991: A Policy Case Study</field><field name="creator">Cstrestrail@hotmail.com</field><field name="description">In 1985 the Australian Government announced a momentous policy initiative allowing Australian universities to enrol full-fee paying international students for the first time. This case study is an analysis of the policy development that ensued at Murdoch University between 1985 and 1991as it responded to this opportunity to alleviate problems, with finance and low student numbers, that were threatening its very existence as an independent university.  In particular, it examines the factors that had placed Murdoch in such a parlous situation, and the reasons why it was able to respond quickly and effectively so as to implement a highly successful and comprehensive program for the recruitment, enrolment and support of full-fee paying international students.

The case study format allowed for the use of a wide range of data sources.  Sources of documentary evidence included: formal written works about the events and concepts under investigation, newspapers and other media items, letters, memoranda, agendas and minutes of meetings, and other internal Murdoch University documents.  In addition, archival materials such as annual reports, budgets and financial records were consulted.  Verification and extension of the documentary and archival evidence was gained from interviews with past and present staff and students of Murdoch University who had been involved with the program.

The study found that organisational changes initiated by successive Vice-Chancellors in the 1980s had replaced a slow and unresponsive, collegial style of decision-making, based on very wide consultation, with a more centralised, bureaucratic and market-oriented system.  New, streamlined procedures, and the devolution of policy-development to small, semi-autonomous committees, enabled the University to rapidly develop policies and procedures for the inauguration of a program for full-fee paying international students in 1987.  The continued success of the program, both in terms of enrolment numbers and financial returns, was found to be based on the creation and development of an almost independent, and entrepreneurial, International Office for the organisation of most aspects of the program, including the marketing and recruitment process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interanational students</field><field name="subject">full fee paying</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20061019.132221</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors leading to offshore manufacture of Australian inventions : the case of the orbital combustion process engine</field><field name="creator">Karen Jane Manley</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the factors which lead to off-shore manufacture of Australian inventions. It establishes this phenomenon as a problem, both in terms of its incidence in the post-war period, and in the strategic importance of innovative activity to economic growth. The thesis utilises a case study approach and concentrates on the experiences of one company, the Orbital Engine Corporation (Orbital). In 1989 Ralph Sarich, inventor of the Orbital Combustion Process (OCP) engine and founder of Orbital, signed an agreement with the Michigan state government to manufacture the engine in the United States of America (USA), in preference to several alternative sites in Australia and overseas. This occurred in the context of Orbital actively pursuing assistance from the Australian government to secure local production. The research question is: Why did Orbital decide to manufacture its engine invention ofshore? A multi-disciplinary approach to this question is adopted. Three different conceptual frameworks are employed: industrial organisation theory, market failure theory and policy network theory. The analysis is not structured around a pre-existing hypothesis; instead, the aim is to generate potential explanations for more rigorous testing by subsequent researchers.

The thesis concludes that, in terms of industrial organisation theory, the decision to manufacture OCP engines off-shore was a function of the poor quality of the Australian industrial context and the failure by those seeking assistance from the Commonwealth government to stress Orbital's status as an exemplary enterprise in Australian industry. Market failure theory indicated that offshore production of the OCP engine was made more likely by the suboptimal operation of the price mechanism, the neglect of market failure arguments by those supporting local production of the engine and 'government failure'. Policy network theory explained Orbital's decision as the result of: ineffective employment of negotiation tactics by proponents of the engine's domestic manufacture; and the chaotic nature of negotiations which allowed certain personal and ideological prejudices to dominate the issue resolution process.

It is shown that some or all of these explanations underlie a number of other examples where Australian inventions have been manufactured offshore. In commenting on policy implications, the thesis points to the economic potential of the Orbital invention and the value of interventionist industry policy. The thesis identifies a number of actions which might be taken to lower the incidence of foreign manufacture of Australian inventions. Further research is necessary to determine the relative importance of the various factors which are identified as leading to offshore production. In addition, there remains a particularly crucial need to improve the social efficiency of existing cost-benefit techniques employed by government policy-makers and commercial analysts.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Orbital Engine Corporation</field><field name="subject">Offshore assembly industry Australia</field><field name="subject">Internal combustion engines</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080115.124359</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SO2/O2 as an oxidant in hydrometallurgy</field><field name="creator">Wensheng Zhang</field><field name="description">Abstract is not available</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Hydrometallurgy</field><field name="subject">Iron Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Oxygen processes</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080115.141151</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electron-helium scattering using analytical and numerical wave functions</field><field name="creator">kaurgurd@willettonshs.wa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Theoretical investigations of electron-inert gas scattering are challenging because of the complex target structure. The electron-Helium system has been the most studied both at low and intermediate energies by sophisticated R-matrix and coupled channels methods. For the other inert gases, few calculations have been attempted at the same level sophistication. One problem is that general target-structure codes provide different forms of wave functions that must be interfaced with the scattering equations. The theoretical work presented in this thesis is based on the momentum-space coupled channels equations. For this formalism only one and two-electron atoms have been studied and purpose-built routines, specific to these atoms, have been developed. For the inert gases however such a task is much more formidable and a more practical approach is to use existing structure codes that have taken several man-years to develop.

The framework of this thesis comprises of two parts. In the first part we discuss the need for, and the way to, modify the existing close-coupling code developed by Berge &amp; Stelbovics in order to interface with other atomic structure packages in the literature. Two mainstream packages, an atomic structure package of Charlotte Froese Fischer and an atomic structure of Alan Hibbert are discussed. Methods to extract the wave functions for Helium and Neon targets using Hibbert's package are given. In the second part, various options and strategies for the calculation of the target structure, including frozen-core and configuration-interaction wave functions, using analytic Slater, Laguerre or numerical orbitals are considered for the Helium target. Hibbert's structure code wave functions are shown to be correctly interfaced into our momentum-space coupled channels code. The pros and cons of the various target structure descriptions are given and applied for lowenergy elastic and inelastic scattering of electron from Helium.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrons Scattering</field><field name="subject">Helium</field><field name="subject">Scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20080123.100101</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian volunteers in the health sector: Antecedents to volunteers&#146; intention to leave</field><field name="creator">psychologist@141.com</field><field name="description">This study focused on the Australian health sector, examining the factors that influence the intention of volunteers to leave their employing organizations. There is a general scarcity of research concerning volunteer work, and understanding health sector volunteers is particularly important due to the significance of their contribution in Australia. In exploring volunteer work, this study has utilized a variant of the Mathieu and Zajac (1990) model of organizational commitment. In the health sector much of the work performed by volunteers is very similar to that done by paid employees. In addition, in the Australian health sector volunteers and paid employees often work alongside one another.

The methodology integrated quantitative and qualitative data in order to generate a broad understanding of the factors influencing volunteer intention to leave an organization. Using the Mathieu and Zajac model variant, a hypothesis was developed and investigated. Quantitative data was gathered through the Job Characteristics Index (JCI), General Job Satisfaction Survey, and Organizational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ). In light of the quantitative findings not supporting the initial hypothesis of job characteristics being antecedent to intention to leave as mediated by job satisfaction and organizational commitment, a grounded theory approach was used to explore the antecedent factors. Qualitative data was gathered through open-ended questions in the
survey and interviews.

The following relationships were discovered and explored: motivation and job characteristics impacted upon the meaningfulness of volunteer work and upon organizational commitment, which had a covarying relationship with job satisfaction. The job characteristics of task identity, feedback and friendship opportunities were correlated with organizational commitment. In essence, the factors of motivation (recognized as altruism) and meaningfulness of work that volunteers do in the Australian health sector determine how the job characteristics and other factors will influence the decision to leave an organization.

The study discusses key findings and presents recommendations for relating to effective management of volunteers in the health sector. As a secondary outcome, the study demonstrates the value of judiciously using models and measures normally associated with paid employment in understanding volunteer activity. It is anticipated that these outcomes will inform future research within the volunteer sector.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Volunteers</field><field name="subject">Organizational commitment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090409.113755</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Strength In-Situ Biocementation of Soil by Calcite Precipitating Locally Isolated Ureolytic Bacteria</field><field name="creator">thassan@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">This study has contributed to the patented technology of biocement (Microbial Biocementation, WO/2006/066326). Biocementation or biogrout is a sand consolidation technology, in which the carbonate released from microbial urea hydrolysis precipitates with an excess of calcium ions to form in-situ calcite (CaCO3) precipitation. Under the right conditions this can result in soil solidification and has found significant commercial interest.

This study has enriched and isolated highly urease active bacteria, particularly suitable for the fermentation process. Six strains with different properties relevant for biocementation were isolated. The most urease active strain (strain MCP11) produced sufficient urease to allow the use of the non-concentrated cell suspension for biocementation experiments. Activities and specific activities were 11-28 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1 and 2.2-5.6 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1.OD-1 respectively. A separate strain (strain MCP4) showed spontaneous flocculation at the end of the batch growth, showing its increased tendency to attach to surfaces. This can be useful for effective cell concentration and for improved attachment during the cementation process.

The possibility of causing cementation by using enrichments rather than pure strains has been documented. This may allow a cheaper production of the urease than by traditional pure culture processes.

Urease production was optimised by increasing the concentration of yeast extract and the addition of Ni2+ ions to the growth media, resulting in increasing urease activity as the reproducible urease yield. This was accomplished by the addition of 10 &#166;&#204;M Ni 2+ ions and increasing the level of yeast extract to 20 g.L-1

Some of the isolated strains were suitable for biocementation process producing mechanical strength (&#161;&#221;0.6 MPa) within several hours depending on the rate of urea conversion. This mechanical strength enhancement of the cemented columns was performed without a large decrease in the permeability.

The formation of CaCO3 crystals in the presence of high concentration of calcium and urea was monitored. This crystal growth was monitored over time by video recording the ureolytic reaction on a microscopic slide. The crystals also were examined through SEM. It was found that two types of CaCO3 precipitates were formed; these precipitates were calcite rhombohedral crystals and spheroids. Video clips showed that the rhombohedral crystals originated from the spheroids. These spheroids were fragile, not stable and were considered to be vaterite.

This study suggested that the strength of the cemented column was caused mostly due to the point-to-point contacts of rhombohedral CaCO3 crystals and adjacent sand grains.

A method of producing high strength cemented samples from sand was developed. This method first attaches the cells into the sand-column by growing them in the presence of calcium ions as little as 6 mM. Then, the cells were incubated in-situ for about 48 hours to enable attachment to the surface of the sand granules. Then the cells were reused over 20-times by continuous supply of cementation solution (equi-molar concentration of calcium and urea). This method produced a mechanical strength of up to 30 MPa, which is equivalent to construction cement.

The mechanical strength could be increased by supplying the bacteria in-situ with a food source and 10 &#166;&#204;M Ni2+
ions, allowing some measures of reaction rate control in-situ. To our knowledge, this study was the first study to use biological cementation to produce strength comparable to that of traditional cemented construction materials such as sandstone and concrete.

The key factors for the optimal CaCO3 precipitation (strength production) in-situ were examined. It was found that in-situ urease activity was the key factor for strength production. The maximum in-situ urease activity was achieved by supplementing the cementation solution with growth media, and the use of 0.5 M urea and Ca2+ as cementation solution. The in-situ urease activity differed according to the different bacterial strains which tolerated the cementation conditions differently.

One of the advantages of the present study was that cementation of porous media could be achieved without clogging the injection end. The injection end could be clogged by CaCO3 precipitation due to cementation reaction (cells, calcium and urea). By sequentially flushing the cells and cementation solution, clogging of the injection end could be avoided and high penetration depth was achieved as long as there was sufficient passage of cementation solution. Uniform cementation along 1 m packed
sand-column was obtained. This uniformity was confirmed by the urease activity measurement, calcite precipitation and mechanical strength production. For finer sand, homogenous cementation proved more difficult.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090409.120801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolism and infection in the stagonospora nodorum-wheat pathosystem</field><field name="creator">o.waters@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, and the causal agent of stagonospora nodorum blotch of wheat. Despite the economic importance of this disease, the molecular basis of the pathosystem is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between metabolism and infection in this pathosystem, with particular reference to the metabolism of mannitol.

In common with many fungi, the main metabolite produced by S. nodorum is the acyclic hexitol mannitol. Among the previously suggested roles for this compound is a role in pathogenicity. The metabolism of mannitol has been hypothesised as occurring in a cycle involving the enzymes mannitol 2-dehydrogenase (Mdh1) and mannitol 1-phosphate 5 dehydrogenase (Mpd1). A strain was created harbouring disruption constructs for both of these genes. The double mutant was unable to synthesise or catabolise mannitol, and was unable to sporulate. Addition of exogenous mannitol completely restored in vitro sporulation, and partially restored in planta sporulation. This demonstrated an essential role for mannitol in asexual sporulation. This is the first demonstrated role for this compound.

A 13C NMR study of the wild type strain, the mdh1 and mpd1 single mutants, and mpd1mdh1 double mutant was undertaken to investigate carbon utilisation and cycling. Disruption of Mpd1 significantly altered the metabolite profile with the mpd1 mutants producing trehalose and glycerol in place of mannitol. Labelling patterns in
the double mutant showed that scrambling of label can be explained by the triosephosphate isomerase triangle and pentose phosphate pathway. This suggests the contribution of mannitol to label scrambling has been overstated in previous studies.

The evidence did not support the metabolism of mannitol in S. nodorum as occurring in a cycle, but rather as two separate pathways.

Despite their success, resistance to TBAs can be a major clinical problem. Mechanisms mediating resistance to TBAs that target the colchicine-binding site on &#946;-tubulin, along with novel therapeutic strategies were investigated. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a multi-targeted TBA active in various cancer types, yet its efficacy and mechanisms(s) of action in haematological malignancies are not well evaluated. To improve understanding of mechanisms(s) of action and drug resistance, leukaemia cells, CCRF-CEM, were selected for resistance to 2ME2. These resistant cells displayed reduced drug-induced mitotic arrest and increased tubulin polymer levels. Moreover, the resistant cells also acquired &#946;-tubulin mutations that affected microtubule stability and induced conformational change(s) to the 2ME2-binding site on &#946;-tubulin. Two of the mutations resided in the colchicine-binding site, yet did not affect colchicine sensitivity, suggesting that 2ME2 and colchicine differ in their binding to &#946;-tubulin. These 2ME2-resistant leukaemia cells have provided novel insights into microtubule stability and drug-target interactions to the tubulin molecule. Differential proteomics analysis identified alterations in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins in the 2ME2-resistant leukaemia cells, including a significant increase in class II &#946;-tubulin. Furthermore, &#947;-enolase and galectin-1 were up-regulated and class IVb &#946;-tubulin was down-regulated in 2ME2-resistant cells. Gene specific knockdown of class II &#946;-tubulin expression in neuroblastoma cells using small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to 2ME2 and other colchicine-binding agents, suggesting that class II &#946;-tubulin plays a functional role in drug resistance and sensitivity. In a clinically relevant NOD/SCID ALL mouse xenograft model, orally active 2ME2 and its analogue, ENMD-1198, increased survival rates in human ALL xenografts compared to control mice. ENMD-1198 showed better activity than 2ME2 against the ALL xenografts. Combining two microtubule-destabilising agents, ENMD-1198 and vincristine, demonstrated synergistic effect by causing microtubule disruption, angiogenesis and cell proliferation inhibition, and apoptosis induction in leukaemia cells. Importantly, ENMD-1198 and vincristine combination was more potent than single agent treatment in a vincristine-resistant ALL xenograft. In conclusion, this thesis identified novel mechanisms of resistance to 2ME2 and developed a new therapeutic strategy that could improve the treatment of drug refractory childhood ALL.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43558</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politically unbecoming: critiques of "democracy" and postsocialist art from Europe</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Anthony Marshall, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical and historical account of how artists have responded to politics of democracy since the late-1980s. Three questions guide the direction of this analysis. Firstly: why, during its apparent apotheosis in recent years, have numerous artists critiqued democracy as the political, critical and aesthetic frame within which to identify their work? Secondly: how have artists undertaken this critique? Thirdly, and most importantly: what aesthetic and political discourses have artists proposed in lieu of the democracy that they critique?  Particular case studies of art from Europe help us to address these questions, for Europe has been an important crucible for vociferous, and often fraught, arguments about democracy in recent aesthetic, philosophical and political discourses. The first chapter of this thesis rigorously contextualises these discourses in relation to historical mobilisations of democracy since the Iron Curtain??s collapse. Relying on writings by Pat Simpson, Slavoj ??i??ek, Alain Badiou and Mario Tronti, I chart the significant imbrications of political ideology, philosophy and what I call ??aesthetics of democratisation?? from the end of European communism, through the democratisations of postcommunism to the militarised democratisations of Iraq and Afghanistan after 2001. Notions of democracy shift and change during this period, becoming what ??i??ek calls a problematic ??transcendental guarantee?? of assumed values and self-legitimation. These shifting values in turn propel the concurrent critiques of democracy that are the subjects of the five subsequent chapters: Ilya Kabakov??s ??total?? installations; Neue Slowenische Kunst??s mimicry of the nation-state during the 1990s; Thomas Hirschhorn??s large-scale works from the late-1990s onwards; Christoph B??chel and Gianni Motti??s collaborative ventures; and the co-operative practices of Dan and Lia Perjovschi. Through examination of the artists?? installations and voluminous writings, and based primarily on archival research and interviews, this thesis examines how their aesthetic politics emerge from the remobilisation of nonconformist art histories, through self-instituted contexts and alternative models for art production, exhibition and interpretation. These models, I argue, counter our usual understandings of art practice and its politics in Europe. They cumulatively assert ??postsocialist aesthetics?? as an impertinent, yet urgent, prism through which to analyse contemporary art.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-socialism</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="subject">Post-communism</field><field name="subject">Ilya Kabakov</field><field name="subject">Manifesta Biennial</field><field name="subject">IRWIN</field><field name="subject">Thomas Hirschhorn</field><field name="subject">Christoph B??chel</field><field name="subject">Gianni Motti</field><field name="subject">Perjovschi</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42880</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the role of novel hormone regulated genes in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Heidi Nicole, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mammary gland development is controlled by hormones such as progesterone and prolactin, which activate a genomic regulatory network. Identification of the components and regulatory links that comprise this network will provide the basis for defining the network's dynamic response during normal development and its perturbation during breast carcinogenesis. This thesis investigates two molecules in detail, Elf5 and KIBRA, which were identified as potential prolactin targets in a transcript profiling screen for key members in this genetic program of mammary morphogenesis. We examined the effect of expression of Elf5, a transcription factor critical in alveolar differentiation, in a 3D culture model of non-transformed mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. We discovered that Elf5 expression was selectively repressed over time in these cells when cultured on a basement membrane, and that Elf5 overexpression disrupted the architecture of acini resulting in luminal filling. This occurred due to an increase in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with repressed the induction of the pro-apoptotic molecule, Bim. We also observed that Elf5 is up-regulated with progesterone treatment, and that suppression of Elf5 expression in T47D breast cancer cells inhibits proliferation. Data obtained from the suppression of Elf5 expression in the presence of progesterone suggested that the role played by Elf5 in the Pg signalling pathway in T47D cells is relatively minor, and that rather than being a major downstream factor, the induction of Elf5 expression is utilised more to influence and potentiate other signalling pathways, such as the Prl pathway.  We characterised expression of KIBRA in the mammary gland and breast cancer cell lines, and observed that KIBRA was also up-regulated with progesterone treatment. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified the tyrosine kinase receptor DDR1 as a binding partner of KIBRA. We have demonstrated that the WW domains of KIBRA bind to a PPxY motif in DDR1, and that these molecules dissociate upon treatment with the DDR1 ligand, collagen. Finally, overexpression and knockdown studies demonstrate that KIBRA promotes the collagen-stimulated activation of the MAPK cascade. Thus KIBRA may play a role in how the reproductive state influences the mammary epithelial cell to respond to changing cell-context information, such as experienced during the tissue remodelling events of mammary gland development. Overall, the data presented in this thesis contributes to our growing knowledge of the genetic program responsible for mammary development and carcinogenesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progesterone</field><field name="subject">mammary development</field><field name="subject">prolactin</field><field name="subject">KIBRA</field><field name="subject">Elf5</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43344</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the zebrafish scube gene family in Hedgehog signalling and slow muscle development.</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Jacque-Lynne Francine Annette, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hedgehog (Hh) signalling from the notochord induces the slow muscle cell fate in the adaxial cells of the developing zebrafish embryo.  Slow muscle formation is disrupted in zebrafish ??you-type?? mutants resulting in U-shaped somites.  In many you-type mutants, genes encoding components of the Hh signalling pathway are mutated.  scube2, a gene not previously known to be involved in Hh signalling, is disrupted in the you-type mutant ??you??.   you mutants are deficient in several Hh dependent cell types and show decreased expression of Hh target genes.  The Scube (signal peptide-CUB domain-EGF-related) family of proteins act as secreted glycoproteins or cell-surface proteins and are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions and ligand binding.  At the protein level, the Scube family resembles the endocytic receptor Cubilin.  Cubilin is known to interact with another endocytic receptor Megalin, which can function as an endocytic receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in vitro.  Megalin endocytosis of Shh may be an important part of the Hh signal transduction pathway.  An anti-Scube2 antibody was developed during this work to investigate the intracellular localization pattern of Scube2 and facilitate the identification of potential Scube2 binding partner(s).  In addition, this work identified and characterized two homologs of scube2 in zebrafish, scube 1 and scube 3.  The high level of similarity amongst the Scube family of proteins and the weak phenotype of the you mutant suggested scube1 and scube3 might also be involved in slow muscle development.  Loss of function experiments performed by antisense morpholino knockdown of scube1 and scube3 in the you mutant decreases the expression of Hh target genes to levels seen in embryos lacking Hh signalling and dramatically enhances the loss of slow muscle fibres compared to you mutants alone.  Thus, injecting both scube1 and scube3 morpholinos into you blocks Hh signalling and these embryos fail to develop slow muscle.  Inhibition of the three partially redundant scube genes inhibits Hh signalling in zebrafish embryos, thereby demonstrating the essential requirement for scube gene function in the Hh signalling pathway.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">muscle development</field><field name="subject">Hedgehog signalling</field><field name="subject">scube gene family</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43316</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No alarms and no surprises; the rise of the domestic non-place</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Tim, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The term non-place is defined by Marc Aug?? as 'a space that cannot be defined as relational, or historical, or concerned with identity.' The key defining factor for Aug?? is that non-places are transitory; they are spaces we flow through. As such any effect they have on us is temporary. This thesis charts the spread of the non-place from spaces of transit to spaces of habitation and the consequences which ensue.  The appearance of the non-place in high schools is examined, looking specifically at the spate of random mass shootings that have occurred in America since 1992. The shootings are an act of extreme performance, facilitated by the architectonics of the non-place. In the contemporary office we see how the principles of late capitalism have incorporated the principles of the non-place to isolate and control the precariat employee. The mall presents the first example of how the non-place has become both habitable and desirable. The pure singularity of the mall&#146;s consumer community not only makes us feel comfortable but it also enables the oxymoronic position of sincerely performing. The home, the so-called foundation of identity, memory and place, is revealed as a non-place in which we are required to be both the producer and consumer of performed identity. The Internet is not a non-place in itself but it is used as a means of expressing non-place sexuality. The Internet is vital to our understanding of the quotidian practicalities of the non-place individual. The non-place is also examined through the poetics of practice. Produced with this thesis is a series of works which wallow in, critique and challenge the non-place.  If the non-place's ambition is universality then the temporary effects becomes permanent. Jean-luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben and George Bataille provide the philosophic platform from which these effects can be properly examined. Through an extensive engagement with constructs of community, identity and performance the true ramifications of the domestication of the non-place is revealed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43718</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the effectiveness of Australian aid to Samoa</field><field name="creator">Hamblin, William John, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">On a global basis over A$450 billion is invested each year in foreign direct investment and aid with a view to supporting development. Developing countries themselves allocate significant sums out of their own budgets in order to stimulate development. Development is concomitantly a major goal and enterprise of the global economy. Developed countries through aid (Official Development Assistance) spend large sums purportedly to improve the development status of developing countries. Recently voices from within the developed world???s establishment have derided the performance of aid and by default the performance of state organisations charged with managing aid delivery. Australia has not been immune from this criticism. Its aid program while modest by global standards still consumes A$1.5 billion in taxpayers money each year. Australian aid is delivered primarily by the Australian International Aid Agency (AusAID) with smaller contributions through the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Defence and Australian Federal Police. AusAID has recently faced severe criticism over failure of the aid investment in the South Pacific to engender development. Most South Pacific countries (excluding Fiji and Samoa) have failed to show desired development. A number have faced bankruptcy (Naru, Solomon Islands), while others have increasing lawlessness (Papua New Guinea). It is important in the above milieu to examine the delivery mechanisms of Australian aid through its chosen vehicle (AusAID) and determine whether aid has really been effective or not. This thesis reviews the development effectiveness of Australian aid in one Pacific island nation ??? Samoa. In this context, the effectiveness of Australian development assistance is reviewed in terms of the results of four case studies of project aid to Samoa. The four case studies cover a range of project activity in differing sectors and offer specific insights into aid policy and delivery and the effects other variables such as culture, history and development status have on development outcomes. The thesis tests the hypothesis that Australian aid to Samoa has resulted in only limited development success and then in ways that are not generally sustainable. In confirming the hypothesis, this thesis identifies that while variables such as the procedural and policy underpinnings of the Australian aid program, aid design/delivery and management, and the history, culture and development status of Samoa impact on the development outcomes, they do not prohibit development. This thesis concludes that development outcomes will be maximised when there are good macro policies present, sound sector policies and real commitments of the government and people to development. Moreover, this thesis finds that while development theories inform the debate over aid none successfully encapsulates  the actual development process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22896</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of gingivitis in pregnancy</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Harris Keith</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1964</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gingivitis</field><field name="subject">Pregnant women -- Dental care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4253</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An in vitro analysis of the behaviour of an alumina based dental all-ceramic restorative system subjected to occlusal loads</field><field name="creator">Ironside, James G</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental materials</field><field name="subject">Dentistry -- Materials</field><field name="subject">Crowns (Dentistry)</field><field name="subject">Partial dentures -- Design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4254</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autoimmunity in chronic periodontitis</field><field name="creator">Ye, Ping</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Periodontitis -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Periodontal disease</field><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4256</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The estates and benefactors of Nostell and Bridlington priories, with special reference to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries</field><field name="creator">Burrows, Toby</field><field name="description">This thesis, which deals with the estates and benefactors of two Yorkshire monasteries (Nostell and Bridlington priories), begins with a definition of the meaning of the terms &#147;estates&#148; and &#147;benefactors&#148; in this context, and an explanation of the possible value of a study in this area.

The purpose of the study is to develop a better understanding of the process of behaviour change and factors which contribute to an increased level of fruit and vegetable intake (F&amp;V) among men in New Zealand. The study aims to determine the impact of psychosocial and contextual factors integrated into an extended stage model. As a more parsimonious continuous model maybe sufficient for understanding F&amp;V intake, the study also plans to evaluate the impact of psychosocial and contextual factors on behaviour, and whether intentions is the mechanism by which the psychosocial factors influence behaviour. Design. Data was collected using a self administered questionnaire in a mail survey from N = 518 men aged 18 years and over randomly selected from the electoral roll. Mean differences in factors across the stages of change were assessed with one way ANOVAs and Games Howell post hoc tests, and trend analyses assessed linear and non-linear components of trend. The independent impact of factors on intentions and behaviour was assessed with hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Measures. Stage of change was assessed with a single item measure, F&amp;V intake with a 7-item food frequency questionnaire, and food insecurity with items used in the 1997 National Nutrition Survey. Previously developed measures were used to assess the pros, cons, self efficacy, self identity, and susceptibility to disease. Scales were developed and adapted for F&amp;V intake for control, descriptive and subjective norms. Results. In total, 51% of men were in the action/maintenance stage and 32%, 10% and 7% in the precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages respectively. Mean F&amp;V intake was 3.92 (SD = 2.08) servings a day and 30.4% were eating at least 5 servings. All factors differed significantly across the stages of change. The predictor variables collectively explained R&#178; = 43% (42% adjusted) in intentions and 40% (38% adjusted) in behaviour. The impact of self efficacy and intentions on behaviour depended in part on household food insecurity status. Discussion. Similar conclusions were reached using the stage and continuous model. To increase intentions of eating 5 or more servings of F&amp;Vs a day in the future, interventions should modify perceived norms, self efficacy, pros and cons, and awareness of F&amp;V guidelines. Interventions targeting those with high food insecurity may also be required to help translate their intentions into action.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diet</field><field name="subject">fruit</field><field name="subject">vegetables</field><field name="subject">male dietary behaviour</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/733</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A social and cultural history of the New Zealand horse : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mincham, Carolyn Jean</field><field name="description">Both in the present and the past, horses have a strong presence in New Zealand society and culture. The country&#8217;s temperate climate and colonial environment allowed horses to flourish and accordingly became accessible to a wide range of people. Horses acted as an agent of colonisation for their role in shaping the landscape and fostering relationships between coloniser and colonised. Imported horses and the traditions associated with them, served to maintain a cultural link between Great Britain and her colony, a characteristic that continued well into the twentieth century. Not all of these transplanted readily to the colonial frontier and so they were modified to suit the land and its people. There are a number of horses that have meaning to this country. The journey horse, sport horse, work horse, warhorse, wild horse, pony and Maori horse have all contributed to the creation of ideas about community and nationhood. How these horses are represented in history, literature and imagery reveal much of the attitudes, values, aspirations and anxieties of the times. Yet despite the clear significance of horses to this country, no one breed of horse has emerged to represent the country as a whole. Unlike many other modern nations, New Zealand has not identified a national horse. Close allegiance to the British heritage as well as a strong sense of local and regional identity has meant that there is no New Zealand Horse to take its place beside the Australian Stockhorse, the Canadian Horse or any of the other national horses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">horses</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/734</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A UI-driven approach to facilitating effective development of rich and composite web applications</field><field name="creator">Yu, Jin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is well-recognized that the development of user interfaces is one of the most time-consuming tasks in the overall application development process. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for rich and fluid user interfaces from web users. As a result, developers are facing increasing challenges in delivering web applications, especially those with rich UI requirements.  In this thesis we present two solutions to facilitate the execution and rapid development of web applications with rich user interfaces. The first solution is a rich internet application (RIA) framework aimed at providing high usability and productivity to web applications, while the second solution is a UI integration framework that simplifies web application development by facilitating the composition of reusable UI components.  The foundation of our RIA framework is an XML-based high-level protocol for communicating asynchronous events and incremental UI updates on the web. The protocol facilitates rich and highly interactive UI, while at the same time eliminates frequent and slow page refreshes and provides a more responsive user experience.  Built on top of the protocol, a server-side runtime allows UI logic code to be executed on the server side, while a set of server-side event-driven API enables developers to implement sophisticated application-specific UI behavior. On the client side, a thin client renders UI and processes native events, but leaves application-specific logic to the server side. The thin client thus allows end users to enjoy a rich UI experience in a safe client environment, without executing any downloaded code.  The proposed UI integration framework includes an abstract UI component model which allows UI components to be programmatically manipulated via events, operations, and properties, essentially exposing UI as services. To facilitate component interactions, the framework offers an event-based composition model, which allows integration logic to be specified in the form of event listeners.  Composite applications are executed via a lightweight runtime middleware, which provides component adapters that allow the middleware to communicate with native UI components implemented in a variety of languages and platforms. Finally, a graphical development environment allows composite applications to be built in a drag-and-drop fashion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional coping strategies in the management of pain in children</field><field name="creator">Jaaniste, Tiina, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this series of studies was to investigate the efficacy of attentional coping strategies in altering children's responses to a painful experience. After a review of the theoretical and empirical links between pain experience and attention, Studies 1-4 compared the efficacy of imagery-based strategies that focussed attention away from a painful experience (distraction) or towards a painful experience (sensory-focussing) on 7- to 14-year-old children??s responses to cold-pressor pain. Image calibration studies (Studies 1-2) ensured that the imagery interventions were matched for other important parameters including affect and vividness. Studies 3 and 4 found that imagery-based attentional coping strategies led to increased tolerance of cold-pressor pain relative to a no-treatment control. Study 3 found that younger children (7-9 years) had better pain outcomes when assigned to the distraction condition than the sensory-focussing condition. For older children (10-14 years) the efficacy of different attentional interventions depended on the degree to which the strategy matched the child's preferred use of distraction as a coping style, providing partial support for the congruence hypothesis. Studies 5-6 tested the novel hypothesis that provision of sensory information before a painful experience may enhance the efficacy of an attentional coping strategy such as distraction. In line with self-regulation theory, children who received preparatory sensory information as well as a distraction intervention showed longer pain tolerance, lower pain intensity ratings, and a trend towards less facial pain expressions than if they received either intervention alone. These findings are discussed in terms of key attentional theories, and theories of attentional development. Implications for theory, clinical practice and further research are also considered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="subject">attention</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">distraction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43384</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on international financial integration, international equity holdings and financial volatility</field><field name="creator">Vo, Xuan Vinh, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to analyse international financial integration. Chapter 2 investigates the determinants of international financial integration. Variables including the capital control policy dummy variable, openness to international trade, domestic credit and economic growth are candidates for explaining variation in the degree of international financial integration.  Chapter 3 analyses cointegration between the US and several European Union equity markets. Between 1993 and 1998, there is mixed evidence of cointegration ties with the US equity market. Over the period covering the introduction of the euro, most of the European markets did not show any evidence of cointegration with the US market. Granger causality tests reveal significant causality running from the US to the European markets. Chapter 4 estimates time series of market and idiosyncratic volatilities for the firms composing the index DJ Eurostoxx 50 following the volatility decomposition method of Campbell et al. (2001). There was a positive trend in both market and firm-level volatility and average correlation among firms has increased. This contrasts with the US evidence in Campbell et al. (2001) of a strong positive trend in firm-level volatility, no trend in market volatility and a decrease in the average correlation. Results confirm a statistically significant market risk-return trade-off and that firm-level volatility has no predictive power for subsequent market returns.  Chapter 5 analyses the link between FDI and economic growth using panel data.  FDI has a stronger positive impact on economic growth in countries with higher levels of education attainment, those that are more open to international trade, have better stock market development and lower rates of population growth and levels of risk. Chapter 6 investigates the determinants of the home bias. Results indicate that capital controls and transaction costs are factors driving the home bias of Australian equity portfolio investment. The home bias lessens if the bilateral trade is higher. Australian investors invest a higher share of their portfolio in countries with better institutions and larger market size.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equity integration</field><field name="subject">International Financial Integration</field><field name="subject">Home bias</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43094</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An In Vivo histological, and In Vitro biomechanical study of nucleus replacement with a novel polymeric hydrogel</field><field name="creator">Pelletier, Matthew Henry, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nucleus replacement has recently come into favor as a possible treatment for Degenerative Disc Disease. Replacing degenerative nucleus tissue with a synthetic material that mimics healthy nucleus tissue may restore normal function and biomechanics to the disc and delay or obviate the need for more invasive procedures such as total disc replacement and fusion. This thesis evaluated a novel protein polymer hydrogel composed of silk and elastin as a nucleus replacement material. There are three experimental components; one in vivo and two in vitro portions. In the first experimental portion, a large animal model was developed to evaluate the biocompatibility of the material as well as the effect on surrounding boney and soft tissues. Three discs were evaluated in each animal; sham, discectomy and discectomy treated with hydrogel. Discs were evaluated at 4, 26 and 52 weeks. The hydrogel group showed a quiet cellular response, as well as decreased boney remodeling and fewer degenerative changes when compared to the discectomy group. The second experimental portion evaluated the biomechanics of 9 cadaveric motion segments loaded in axial rotation, lateral bending, flexion/extension (FE) and compression. Specimens were tested sequentially in the intact state, following annulotomy, discectomy and after hydrogel treatment. Range of Motion (ROM) in FE was shown to increase from the intact state (8.50+/-1.44&#730;) to the discectomy state (9.86+/-1.77&#730;) and decrease following hydrogel treatment (8.66+/-0.76&#730;) to be similar to the intact ROM. The third experimental portion investigates the effect of three commonly applied testing conditions on the mechanical properties of spinal segments. 27 motion segments were tested at 18&#730;C wrapped with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), at 37&#730;C in a PBS bath, and at 37&#730;C and 100% humidity. Specimens were tested hourly for 6 hours. The heated conditions were shown to have lower stiffness and increased range of motion when compared 18 &#730;C tests. Repeated testing with time increased neutral zone and ROM for all modes of bending. As tests are repeated over time, tissue properties change and may mask the ability of a nucleus replacement to restore biomechanics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">spine</field><field name="subject">nucleus pulposus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43319</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of bladder cancer progression</field><field name="creator">Hung, Tzong Tyng, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bladder cancer (BlCa) is the second most common genitourinary cancer, affecting both men and women. Most (70%) cases present at the superficial stage; 20% of these recur with muscle-invasive disease. Major genetic alterations associated with BlCa include: loss/gain in expression or mutations in Retinoblastoma (RB) gene, human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs), H-ras, p53 and FGFR3. Only p53 mutations are well correlated with invasive BlCa; other changes show variable correlations with disease status. To understand the progression of BlCa, a model of nine human BlCa cell sublines derived from a single parent but differing in in vivo characteristics, has been developed previously. These cells represent a heterogenous population from a single tumour and a model of different stages of BlCa progression, from non-tumourigenic to invasive. Two sublines were selected for further investigation: C3 (non-tumourigenic) and B8 (invasive). These were transfected with green (C3-GSP-2) and red fluorescent reporters (B8-RSP-gck) respectively to investigate the effects of their co-injection in vivo, specifically, promotion of C3 tumour growth by B8 cells. Surprisingly, B8 tumour growth was inhibited by C3 cells in vivo at different cell numbers and proportions of cells injected. Microarray analysis of C3 and B8 cells revealed differential expression of 1367 genes with dramatic differences in the transforming growth factor-?? and integrin-mediated pathways. Gene expression of BMP2, INHBB, FST, NOG, ID4 and TGF- ??1, in the TGF- ?? pathway was further analysed with qRT-PCR in all nine sublines. Expression of BMP2 was significantly related to tumourigenic potential (p=0.0238, Mann-Whitney) and INHBB to invasive ability (p=0.0476, Mann-Whitney). The BlCa model did not include a metastatic component. To broaden the model, cell lines were established from an invaded lymph-node (B8-RSP-LN) and a bone-metastasis (B8-RSP-BN) after subcutaneous and intra-cardiac injection of B8-RSP-gck cells. No significant differences were observed in the migratory capability and anchorage-independent colony formation of these metastatic cells compared with B8 cells. Evaluation of expression of the panel of TGF-beta genes (BMP2, INHBB, FST, NOG, ID4 and TGF- ??1) and metastasis-related genes (MMP9, MMP2 and KAI1) indicated that expression of BMP2, FST, ID4 and MMP9 was decreased or lost in the metastatic sublines.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Progression</field><field name="subject">Bladder cancer</field><field name="subject">Transforming growth factor beta</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39786</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for understanding factors that intervene between positive evaluations of acquisition candidates and entry into negotiations</field><field name="creator">Connell, Richard B., Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">There are substantial bodies of literature that advance theory about why Merger and Acquisition (M and A) candidates are found to be unattractive, why negotiations aren???t concluded and why the benefits of companies that are acquired are not realized.  Little, if any, research identifies why M and A opportunities are not pursued in the period after candidates are analysed and found to be attractive but before negotiations begin.  This study addresses this period by developing a theoretical framework of the variables that intervene to reverse decisions to pursue apparently attractive candidates before negotiations begin and which, in doing so, result in missed opportunities. The study is informed primarily by the Strategic Management content literature (Ansoff, 1965, Porter, 1980) but draws from the strategy process literature (Huff and Reger, 1987) including streams in Strategic Decision Making (SDM) (Papadakis and Barwise, 1998, Schwenck, 1995). The framework is developed using a multiple-case study method.  This choice was dictated by the study???s theory building objective, the nature of the research questions ??? that is, what variables influence decisions and how? ??? and the lack of an existing theoretical foundation on which to build. The sample consisted of 37 decisions reversals made by 27 firms in Australia, Europe and the USA.  The results suggest that there are three major categories of variables that stop acquirers from pursuing potentially attractive acquisition candidates.  These are related to the acquirers???: ???	Strategy and objectives:  For example, whether there is a change in strategy or objectives, or either or both are poorly understood and agreed between organizational levels or units; ???	Organizational functional resources: For example, whether constraints on appropriate knowledge and skill sets develop or are perceived to be likely to develop during the post-evaluation period; ???	Other financial factors: For example, whether a shortage of funds develops. Twelve individual variables are identified.  Ten of these appear to be consistent with factors that Ansoff and colleagues (1971) associate with post-acquisition failure although variable definitions are not always comparable.  Poor management of the variables thus appears to have the potential to expose acquirers to two different but important vulnerabilities.  First, potentially attractive M and A opportunities may be forgone if the variables are operative in the post-evaluation ??? pre-negotiation period; second, if they don???t become operative until after the acquisition is consummated, the benefits of attractive companies that are acquired may not be realized. This study???s most important contribution is to the theoretically diverse base of acquisition performance literature which, to-date, tends to examine phases in the M and A decision making process before or after the focal period of this study.  It also illustrates the use of a general multi-theoretic model of Strategic Decision Making  (Rajagopolan, et al., 1993, 1998) exclusively in the M and A domain, a domain whose decisions are worthy of study in their own right. Finally, it provides insights into a new set of factors subject to control that managers may take into account in their acquisition planning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consolidation and merger of corporations</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22266</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising hydraulic fracture treatments in reservoirs under complex conditions</field><field name="creator">Valencia, Karen Joy, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Growing global energy demand has prompted the exploitation of non-conventional resources such as Coal Bed Methane (CBM) and conventional resources such as gas-condensate reservoirs. Exploitation of these resources primarily depends on stimulation by hydraulic fracturing. Traditional hydraulic fracturing practices, however, are in many ways inadequate in addressing difficulties associated with these non-conventional and conventional resources. For example, complex in-situ stress distribution, large material property contrasts and unique production mechanism complicate the implementation of hydraulic fracture treatments in CBM and gas-condensate reservoirs respectively. An integrated approach to optimise hydraulic fracture treatments in reservoirs under complex conditions is developed in this thesis. The optimisation methodology integrates a fracture geometry model which predicts fracture geometry for a given set of treatment parameters, a production model which estimates reservoir productivity after stimulation and an economic model which calculates net present value. A stochastic optimisation algorithm combining features of evolutionary computations is used to search for the optimum design. Numerical techniques such as finite element analysis, iterative semi-analytical methods and evolutionary computation are also used. The following are the major contributions of this thesis: 1. A three-dimensional hydraulic fracture geometry model which accounts for poroelastic effects, in-situ stress and rock material properties, has been developed to provide a more realistic description of the hydraulic fracture geometry. This served as a tool to visualise hydraulic fracture propagation for a given in-situ stress distribution, rock material properties and treatment parameters. Furthermore, by accounting for poroelastic effects, it is possible to identify the causes of exceptionally high treatment pressures. 2. An innovative production model was formulated in this thesis to quantify the well deliverability due to hydraulic fracturing. The production model has been used for a range of production scenarios for CBM and gas-condensate reservoirs such as: multiple wells at arbitrary locations and various well types (stimulated and unstimulated wells). 3. The optimisation methodology presented in this work provides a platform for operators to assess risks and gains associated with different field development scenarios. The added feature of sub-optimal NPV contouring provided flexibility to calibrate the treatment design in real-time. The strength of the optimisation methodology lies in the flexibility to: (1) impose design constraints, (2) optimise multiple variables and (3) simulate multiple objectives.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oil wells</field><field name="subject">hydraulic fracturing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23318</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration of branched circular cylindrical shells as applied to airway walls</field><field name="creator">Au, Pui Ming</field><field name="description">This research focuses on investigating the vibration characteristics of branched circular cylindrical shells with applications to airway passages.

Such an exploration necessarily extends into unethical, unsafe and unfair practices, eight of which are selected for detailed analysis. These are: working in smoke, sexual harassment, constructive dismissal, staffing levels, training, illegal alcohol service, poor food hygiene, and theft. Some of these problems or practices are deliberately destructive (and are therefore considered as ethical issues), some can cause harm (so are health and safety issues), and some concern the way staff are managed (and are therefore labour issues). The persistent focus however, is the avoidable harm and wrongdoing that can occur where groups of people are controlled by a few. Several themes are explored, in particular the causes of poor ethical standards and management's influence on these standards. The hypotheses address the behaviour of hospitality workers generally, but managers in particular, as they are ultimately responsible for workplace conduct, and are therefore best placed to make change. Ethical standards are investigated by measuring the actual and perceived incidence, tolerance and management acceptance of problems according to individuals' demographic attributes. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data enables a thorough and scientific analysis of practices in a domain well known for persistent social problems, with the specific intention of identifying causes, and therefore solutions. The following hypotheses are examined: H1) Unethical behaviour is common in hospitality; H2) Management is aware of unethical behaviour in hospitality; H3) Management actively or passively supports unethical behaviour in hospitality, and H4) Management's support is a cause of unethical behaviour. Although unethical practices are found to be common, many managers are unaware of this, while some are significant causes of sexual harassment, constructive dismissals and poor standards of training. Observations include the influence of codes of ethics on undesirable behaviours such as sexual harassment, the influence of social consensus on workplace behaviour, and the profound unhappiness of many hospitality employees. The causes of workplace problems and unethical behaviour are found to be low pay and poor training. A principle of reciprocated loyalty is proposed, based on the relationships identified between employer commitment and employee behaviour, and informed by mechanism theory, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is the first major analysis of workplace issues in New Zealand hospitality, and offers solutions to problems such as theft, sexual harassment and understaffing, that significantly undermine the industry's credibility and potential for success.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/353</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The electronic, structural, and magnetic properties of the chromium dihalides - from the gas-phase to the solid-state : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Chemistry at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vest, Brian Michael</field><field name="description">Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (broken symmetry) density functional calculations have been used to determine the low-energy geometries of the chromium dihalide molecules (CrX2) and their clusters, Cr2X4, Cr3X6, and Cr4X8. The monomers are also investigated at a higher level, including coupled-cluster and state-average CASSCF computations. Our calculations show that the monomers have a 5B2 ground state arising from the Renner-Teller distorted 5IIg transition state, leading to a bent geometry. The global minima of the gas-phase clusters of CrF2 and CrCl2 consist of two-dimensional, anti-ferromagnetically coupled chains of CrX2 units forming four-membered, doubly bridged Cr2X2 rings, closely resembling their solid-state structures. The global minima of the CrBr2 and CrI2 clusters consist of the same two-dimensional chain-like structures for their dimers, but their trimers and tetramers consist of three-dimensional &#8217;triangular&#8217; structures which contain two capping ligands bound to three chromium atoms along with a Cr-Cr bond. Each Cr atom within these clusters has spin quantum number S=2. There is approximately a constant change in energy, between 45-55 kcal/mol, with every new CrX2 unit during cluster formation. Information about the structure of the CrCl2 clusters is used in the reanalysis of high-temperature electron diffraction data. The vapor at 1170 K contains about 77% monomeric molecules, 19% dimers, and a small amount of trimers. Monomeric CrCl2 is found to be bent with a bond angle of 149(10)degrees, in good agreement with our computations. Solid-state DFT calculations are performed on alpha-CrCl2 to determine the lattice structure and spin-coupling constants for the Cr atoms within the crystals. The GGA (PW91) method produces a structure in good agreement with the literature. In the lowest energy structure, the spins of the Cr atoms within the chains along the crystallographic c-axis are anti-ferromagnetically coupled with four parallel spins situated almost exclusively in the d-bands of Cr along these chains. This anti-ferromagnetic coupling is also seen in the CrX2 clusters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromium dihalides</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/744</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neoliberalism and social patterns : constructions of home and community in contemporary New Zealand fiction : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in English at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Kirsten Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Constructions of home, family and community as ways of belonging have been ongoing discourses in New Zealand. This thesis examines constructions of home and family in works of fiction by four contemporary New Zealand authors: Alice Tawhai, Charlotte Grimshaw, Witi Ihimaera and Damien Wilkins. It asks how the main sociological characteristics of the period are presented and performed through fiction. Through these characters and their situations these authors expose the social fantasy of contemporary New Zealand society: that of individual reflexive opportunity. The twentieth century has seen a changing social fabric with loosening of bonds and the increase of individualism. The New Zealand way of life is changing, with increasing interconnectedness of the world through globalisation. Neo-liberal ideology, itself a response to globalising effects, has exacerbated social fragmentation and income disparity. Neoliberalism, a retreat of the state from both financial control and support of individuals, presumes a logic of market-forces and rational choice based on the maximisation of opportunity. This has implications for the individual&#8217;s sense of self and ways of belonging as the New Zealand subject is increasingly premised on personal responsibility. This thesis looks at the economic and sociological analyses of neoliberalism and asks if they are confirmed in the fiction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Alice Tawhai</field><field name="subject">Charlotte Grimshaw</field><field name="subject">Witi Ihimaera</field><field name="subject">Damien Wilkins</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/736</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing CBL systems for complex domains using problem transformation and fuzzy logic : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mohanarajah, Selvarajah</field><field name="description">Some disciplines are inherently complex and challenging to learn. This research attempts to design an instructional strategy for CBL systems to simplify learning certain complex domains. Firstly, problem transformation, a constructionist instructional technique, is used to promote active learning by encouraging students to construct more complex artefacts based on less complex ones. Scaffolding is used at the initial learning stages to alleviate the difficulty associated with complex transformation processes. The proposed instructional strategy brings various techniques together to enhance the learning experience. A functional prototype is implemented with Object-Z as the exemplar subject. Both objective and subjective evaluations using the prototype indicate that the proposed CBL system has a statistically significant impact on learning a complex domain. CBL systems include Learner models to provide adaptable support tailored to individual learners. Bayesian theory is used in general to manage uncertainty in Learner models. In this research, a fuzzy logic based locally intelligent Learner model is utilized. The fuzzy model is simple to design and implement, and easy to understand and explain, as well as efficient. Bayesian theory is used to complement the fuzzy model. Evaluation shows that the accuracy of the proposed Learner model is statistically significant. Further, opening Learner model reduces uncertainty, and the fuzzy rules are simple and resemble human reasoning processes. Therefore, it is argued that opening a fuzzy Learner model is both easy and effective. Scaffolding requires formative assessments. In this research, a confidence based multiple test marking scheme is proposed as traditional schemes are not suitable for measuring partial knowledge. Subjective evaluation confirms that the proposed schema is effective. Finally, a step-by-step methodology to transform simple UML class diagrams to Object-Z schemas is designed in order to implement problem transformation. This methodology could be extended to implement a semi-automated translation system for UML to Object Models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CBL systems</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Problem transformation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/743</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indo-Malaysians within the Malaysian education system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Prabakaran, Gaayathri</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore the factors that limit the freedom of choice and access of the Indian community to tertiary level education in Malaysia. Issues of ethnic minorities are of concern for all multi-cultural societies. In Malaysia, it was the indentured labour system, introduced by the British colonial rulers who brought non-Malays into this previously mono-ethnic society. British colonisation has influenced the position of the Indian community in Malaysia in a number of ways, which are explored in this thesis. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of the complexity of this plural society and its implications for one of its ethnic minority groups, particularly in terms of education. This sector has been examined as education is a fundamental component for socio-economic development and upward social mobility. Malaysia, a classic modern day plural society, has its own complexity in terms of issues of ethnic minorities. The findings of this thesis indicate four main factors limiting the freedom of choice and access to tertiary level education for the Indian community. These factors are the country&#8217;s education policies, the financial situation of Indo-Malaysians, the attitude and awareness of the students, and the community&#8217;s values. The findings are significant as it is believed that the advancement of the Indian community in Malaysia is currently obstructed through lack of access to tertiary level education. Before this situation can be improved it needs to be understood.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indo-Malaysians</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Access to tertiary education</field><field name="subject">Ethnic minorities</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/737</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and evaluating incremental evolution using high quality performance measures for genetic programming : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosphy in Computer Science at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walker, Matthew Garry William</field><field name="description">This thesis is divided into two parts. The  first part considers and develops some of the statistics used in genetic programming (GP) while the second uses those statistics to study and develop a form of incremental evolution and an early termination heuristic for GP. The first part looks in detail at success proportion, Koza's minimum computational effort, and a measure we rename "success effort". We describe and develop methods to produce confidence intervals for these measures as well as confidence intervals for the difference and ratio of these measures. The second part studies Jackson's fitness-based incremental evolution. If the number of fitness evaluations are considered (rather than the number of generations) then we find some potential benefit through reduction in the effort required to find a solution. We then automate the incremental evolution method and show a statistically significant improvement compared to GP with automatically defined functions (ADFs). The success effort measure is shown to have the critical advantage over Koza's measure as it has the ability to include a decreasing cost of failure. We capitalise on this advantage by demonstrating an early termination heuristic that again offers a statistically significant advantage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Incremental evolution</field><field name="subject">Genetic programming</field><field name="subject">Performance measures</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/738</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drop out from state secondary girls' schools in New Zealand : an ecological perspective : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Coutts, Christine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Economic change requiring a more highly skilled workforce prompted worldwide concern over high school drop out. Dropouts are young people who leave school early, often without attaining formal educational qualifications. Much previous research centred on at-risk students and a range of individual, social, family and school factors associated with drop out were identified. This case study of student drop out and retention at three girls&#8217; state secondary schools over 2003 suggests that early leaving behaviour cannot be understood outside of the settings in which it occurs. Adopting an ecological perspective facilitated a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between the dropouts and their environment. From a narratives and numbers approach rich stories of early leaving emerged. Patterns of leaving were consistent with national trends: The lower decile school had the highest drop out rate, and dropouts were more likely to be Maori and Pasifika than European. Dropping out was shown to be a complicated and iterative process in which the influence of the environment is very important. Family and school relationships had a major impact but which had the greatest influence was inconclusive because there was a high level of interconnectedness between these proximal settings within the mesosystem and the bigger picture education and welfare systems. The extent of the contribution each level made to early leaving varied across individual stories, between schools and over time. Leaving school is an ecological transition that involves changing roles from high school pupil to that of tertiary student, mother, worker or benefit recipient. The students&#8217; stories show drop out to be both an outcome, and an initiator, of developmental change. An important challenge for schools is not necessarily to reduce the number of early leavers but to establish effective transition programmes that assist students to become proactive in navigating the many transitions anticipated over their life course. The implementation of such school programmes needs to be supported by parallel changes in government policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dropouts</field><field name="subject">Girls' high schools</field><field name="subject">Secondary schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/740</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feature-based rapid object detection : from feature extraction to parallelisation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barczak, Andre Luis Chautard</field><field name="description">This thesis studies rapid object detection, focusing on feature-based methods. Firstly, modifications of training and detection of the Viola-Jones method are made to improve performance and overcome some of the current limitations such as rotation, occlusion and articulation. New classifiers produced by training and by converting existing classifiers are tested in face detection and hand detection. Secondly, the nature of invariant features in terms of the computational complexity, discrimination power and invariance to rotation and scaling are discussed. A new feature extraction method called Concentric Discs Moment Invariants (CDMI) is developed based on moment invariants and summed-area tables. The dimensionality of this set of features can be increased by using additional concentric discs, rather than using higher order moments. The CDMI set has useful properties, such as speed, rotation invariance, scaling invariance, and rapid contrast stretching can be easily implemented. The results of experiments with face detection shows a clear improvement in accuracy and performance of the CDMI method compared to the standard moment invariants method. Both the CDMI and its variant, using central moments from concentric squares, are used to assess the strength of the method applied to hand-written digits recognition. Finally, the parallelisation of the detection algorithm is discussed. A new model for the specific case of the Viola-Jones method is proposed and tested experimentally. This model takes advantage of the structure of classifiers and of the multi-resolution approach associated with the detection method. The model shows that high speedups can be achieved by broadcasting frames and carrying out the computation of one or more cascades in each node.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human face recognition</field><field name="subject">Pattern recognition systems</field><field name="subject">Computer vision</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/742</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A LEEP forward : biodiversity futures for New Zealand : a thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Master of Resource and Environmental Planning at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Calder, Keith Wallace</field><field name="description">Loss of indigenous biodiversity continues in New Zealand. Despite admirable goals in the NZBS 2000 to the contrary, efforts at improved biodiversity conservation have been insufficient to halt loss of significant amounts of indigenous forest and wildlife habitat. Increasing numbers of native species are moving towards critically endangered and extinction. Whatever we are doing in New Zealand, it is not effective enough. The aim of this study is to firstly identify factors contributing to the failure, &#8220;to halt the decline of indigenous biodiversity&#8221; in New Zealand and to then consider opportunities to overcome these barriers. In considering opportunities, this study then reviews the emerging discipline of landscape ecology as an answer to, at least, some of those factors and the recurring calls from New Zealand ecologists for a more integrated and holistic approach to biodiversity conservation. Recent advances in the planning framework and particularly provisions for biodiversity conservation in England are explored as a model of practical application of landscape ecological principles to land-use planning. From this review, the study proposes a new &#8216;LEEP&#8217; model for strategic biodiversity conservation that produces a regional-scale spatial conservation map and accompanying policy and implementation guide. Together they provide an integrated and holistic approach to restoring or creating functional landscapes that also recognises and provides for human activities and development. Application of the LEEP model is demonstrated through a case study of the Wellington region. Benefits and potential uses of the map and policy outputs are canvassed. Interviews with leading New Zealand and international ecologists provide an assessment of the current status of landscape ecology and interviewees also act as an expert &#8216;test panel&#8217; against which the Wellington maps and guides produced from the &#8216;LEEP&#8217; model are assessed. Finally, suggestions are provided for development of the new model and future research needs towards fuller and more effective implementation of this approach to biodiversity conservation in the New Zealand context.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">Biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">LEEP model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/741</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Operational modal analysis and model updating with a cyclostationary input</field><field name="creator">Hanson, David, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of identifying the modal properties of a system based only on measurements of the system responses. This situation is frequently encountered in structural dynamics and is particularly relevant for systems where the in-service excitation is not artificially reproducible. The inherent non-linearities in these systems mean that the modal properties estimated using traditional input/output techniques will be different to those exhibited in operation. A common example from the literature is an aircraft in flight where the modal properties are heavily influenced by the operating point, i.e. the combination of load, speed, altitude etc., at which the aircraft is travelling. The process of identifying the modal properties of systems in-service is called Operational Modal Analysis (OMA). Not knowing the input complicates the analysis. Most of the techniques in the literature overcome the lack of knowledge about the unmeasured excitations by assuming they are both spatially and frequentially white, i.e. of equal magnitude and with a flat autospectrum. This thesis presents a new technique for OMA which relaxes these constraints, requiring only that the system is excited by a so called cyclostationary input with a unique cyclic frequency, and that the log spectrum of the second order component of this input is frequentially smooth, as will be explained. Such systems include vehicles with internal combustion engines as the vibration from such an engine exhibits cyclostationary statistics. In this thesis, the technique is applied to a laboratory test rig and a passenger train both using an artificial input, and to a race car using the engine as the excitation. By combining cyclostationary signal processing and the concept of the cepstrum, the technique identifies the resonances and anti-resonances in the transfer functions between each response and the cyclostationary source. These resonances and antiresonances can be used to regenerate Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) and it is shown how the unknown scaling of the system can be recovered by employing finite element model updating in conjunction with this regeneration. In addition, the contribution made to model updating by the anti-resonances is also investigated. Finally, the potential of OMA to inform a model updating process is demonstrated using an experimental case study on a diesel railcar.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modal analysis; structural dynamics -- mmathematical models; cyclostationary waves; finite element method.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31199</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prawns, climate change, rising costs and falling prices : managing NSW???s prawn stocks in a world of uncertainties : a quantitative analysis of prawn harvesting strategies</field><field name="creator">Ives, Matthew Carl, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The monitoring and assessment of prawn populations in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, has been identified as a continuing research priority by both the fishing industry and the fisheries managers. This dissertation presents a series of dynamic population models developed to evaluate the status of the eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) and eastern school prawn (Metapenaeus macleayi) populations within NSW and to analyse the relative performance of a number of alternative management strategies involving the three fisheries that target these species. Monthly commercial prawn catch and effort data from 1984 to 2006 were used to calibrate the stock assessment models. Where possible, the results of previous research were used to develop the structure of the model and to provide estimates of biological parameters. A process of increasing model complexity, including the addition of physical processes, such as river discharge events and economic considerations, was undertaken in an attempt to develop the most appropriate model for the analysis of management strategies.  The first model presented was used to undertake a single-species assessment of the eastern king prawn stock and was based on a delay-difference population model with four different representations of recruitment. This model was calibrated to observations using the Bayesian sampling/importance re-sampling method and used to test the effect of significant changes in the future catch on the stock. The second model presented is a size-based metapopulation model which incorporated the dynamics of school prawns over three habitats, being harvested by three different fishing methods. This model was used to test the effect of alternative climate variability scenarios on the stock. The third model presented is a multi-species, multi-fishery bio-economic model. This model was used to examine the impact of nine alternative economic scenarios, incorporating various combinations of input costs and product prices. The results from the use of these models indicated that neither of the prawn population appeared to be over-exploited. The analyses also indicated that none of the alternative management strategies were found to stand-out enough to justify a move away from the current management strategy of input controls and spatio-temporal closures, even under a range of future scenarios including climate change and large movements in input costs and product prices.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural resource management.</field><field name="subject">Fisheries modelling.</field><field name="subject">Fisheries population dynamics.</field><field name="subject">Bayesian modelling.</field><field name="subject">Metapopulation modelling.</field><field name="subject">Climate change.</field><field name="subject">Fisheries -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39192</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic threshold range aggregate query processing over uncertain data</field><field name="creator">Yang, Shuxiang, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Uncertainty is inherent in many novel and important applications such as market surveillance, information extraction sensor data analysis, etc. In the recent a few decades, uncertain data has attracted considerable research attention. There are various factors that cause the uncertainty, for instance randomness or incompleteness of data, limitations of equipment and delay or loss in data transfer.  A probabilistic threshold range aggregate (PRTA) query retrieves summarized information about the uncertain objects in the database satisfying a range query, with respect to a given probability threshold. This thesis is trying to address and handle this important type of query which there is no previous work studying on.  We formulate the problem in both discrete and continuous uncertain data model and develop a novel index structure, asU-tree (aggregate-based sampling-auxiliary U-tree) which not only supports exact query answering but also provides approximate results with accuracy guarantee if efficiency is more concerned. The new asU-tree structure is totally dynamic. Query processing algorithms for both exact answer and approximate answer based on this new index structure are also proposed.

This predation cost of communicating has typically been attributed to signalling individuals because of their conspicuous role. But if predators are attracted to signals, then receivers, both intended or otherwise, may also find themselves at risk of predation. In this thesis, I used olfactorily communicating house mice Mus domesticus to address several key questions regarding the predation risks to receivers of conspecific signals. Using field experiments, I established that several predator species are rapidly attracted to the scent signals of their mouse prey. Male house mice were sensitive to this risk of predation when receiving conspecific signals. Mice traded off the predation risks of receiving with the perceived social value of a conspecific scent signal, however, and were more willing to receive signals of high social value than those of low social value when in the presence of a predation cue. But mice did not relinquish all antipredatory behaviours to receive signals. Instead, spatial point pattern analyses revealed that they used small-scale changes in space use to maintain receiving rates of conspecific signals, while minimising excess movements likely to attract a predator??s attention. Mice were also sensitive to the risks posed by scents in different spatial configurations. They perceived patchily distributed scents as more risky than randomly or regularly distributed scents, highlighting the importance of considering scale when examining predator:prey interactions. I further extended the concept of risky receiving to show that it includes interspecific eavesdropping ?? greatly generalising our concept of the landscape of fear. In a final laboratory experiment, I reveal a mechanism for the otherwise maladaptive maintenance of receiving under predation risk. The effects of social isolation on aggressive and anti-social behaviours were gradually attenuated by exposing male mice to the scents of an increasing number of conspecifics, despite a lack of physical contact. Thus, while prey are sensitive to the increased risks of predation when receiving con- and hetero-specific signals, they must balance this risk against the perceived social benefits of receiving a signal, and the potentially severe social costs of not doing so.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43315</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time and memory in the novels of Eleanor Dark</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Helen Edna, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I will demonstrate that Eleanor Dark's over-riding themes are time and memory.

The thesis considers Dark's fiction in sequence to chart her treatment of time and memory.  Simultaneously Dark was reaching into her own reservoir ofmemory and transfiguring her own experience in the characters, events and locations of her novels. In this oblique way, and through this unique form of modelling, Dark reveals little known areas of her life. Biographically Dark remains elusive; the surface events of her life are well documented but do not account for the drama of her character portrayals, the immediacy of her perceptions of the natural world, her deep intellectual responses to art, literature and politics, as well as her preoccupation with time.  It is my contention that Dark's creative thrust was inwards; she developed the inner processes of memory and imagination.

Efforts to understand recent, apparently anomalous ENSO behaviour are hampered by the lack of long, high-quality climate records. While instrumental data generally covers the past 150 years, record length is insufficient for the assessment of past changes in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of ENSO. Here, multiproxy networks of high-resolution tree-ring, coral, ice and documentary records derived from eastern and western Pacific ENSO ???centres of action??? are analysed (A.D. 1525-2002). Considerable improvements in ENSO reconstruction are achieved from expanding the use of records from the western Pacific. In particular, ~500 years of a continuous 3,722 year ENSO sensitive tree-ring record from New Zealand is introduced. Although extreme ENSO events are seen throughout a 478-year discrete event analysis, 43% of extreme, 20% of very strong and 28% of all protracted ENSO events occur within the 20th century. Principal component analysis was used to extend instrumental records of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) Ni??o 3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (Ni??o 3.4 SST) and a newly developed coupled ocean-atmospheric ENSO index (CEI) by 347 years. Significantly, of the three indices reconstructed here, CEI reconstructions were largely found to be the best predictors of ENSO. The results suggest that ENSO may be more effectively characterised using a coupled ocean-atmosphere index, particularly for December-May periods. Compared to the pre-instrumental period, the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicate a clear trend toward increased ENSO variability over the past 150 years. Significantly, spectral analysis of reconstructed indices reveals a marked change in the frequency and intensity of ENSO beginning ~A.D. 1850, coinciding with the end of the Little Ice Age and the boom in global industrialisation. This suggests that ENSO may operate differently under natural (pre-industrial) and anthropogenically influenced background states.

An important element of successful ageing is the maintenance of optimal nutritional status, which is linked to general health and quality of life. The purpose of this mixed methods study, guided by qualitative descriptive methods, was to identify barriers to healthy eating in a group of older single-living New Zealand men. Understanding the men&#8217;s perspectives on meal procurement and preparation, in essence walking in their shoes, was a key part of identifying barriers to healthy eating. A cohort of 12 men participated, each completing a semi-structured interview as well as a nutrition knowledge and nutritional risk assessment questionnaire. Data from the semi-structured interviews was analysed using a general inductive approach. The results of the questionnaire were used to enrich description in this mixed methods study. Three core themes emerged from the data which were &#8216;Individual Circumstances&#8217;; &#8216;Nutrition Knowledge and Skills&#8217;; and &#8216;Food-Related Values&#8217;. Potential barriers to healthy eating, in terms of individual circumstances, were limited finances, limited mobility and a lack of personal transport. These barriers were partially ameliorated by effective, reliable social and support networks. A diverse range of shopping, cooking and gardening skills, as well as nutrition knowledge, existed amongst the men. Poor nutrition knowledge and limited cooking skills were possible barriers to healthy eating. Strong beliefs the men held about how food procurement and preparation should occur, termed food-related values, were also potential barriers to healthy eating. Values identified were &#8216;the importance of healthy eating&#8217;; &#8216;structure in food-related activities&#8217;; &#8216;convenience&#8217;; and &#8216;like it or not, it has to be done &#8211; shopping and cooking&#8217;. Depending on the prioritisation of values by the individual, they could develop into barriers. For example, prioritising &#8216;convenience&#8217; over &#8216;the importance of healthy eating&#8217; led to decisions that negatively impacted dietary intake. This study highlighted the diversity of experiences, circumstances, skills and priorities of older single-living men. Interventions aimed at improving the dietary behaviours of older single-living New Zealand men must recognise the heterogeneity of this population and support the values they hold in regards to food-related activities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older men</field><field name="subject">single-living men</field><field name="subject">healthy eating</field><field name="subject">dietary behaviours</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/606</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Method of analysing the risk of injury in young female gymnasts due to repetitive loading and fatigue</field><field name="creator">Beatty, Karen Tania, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The majority of gymnasts are young girls. Training hours required to meet competition demands are high and gymnasts begin serious training at a young age. Concerns regarding injury risk are substantial and may be the result of repeated high impact loads experienced during landings from dismounts, tumbling and vaulting. There is currently little information available to coaches regarding the quantity of training that is safe or not safe. The use of acceleration was tested for its efficacy for use in the field to examine risk factors for injury. Risk factors examined were loading and fatigue. Kinematics, ground reaction forces and acceleration were measured during landing from gymnastics skills and also pre- and post fatigue during landing from a vertical jump and a 35cm drop in the laboratory.  A pilot study was performed in the field to examine accelerations during gymnastics skills pre- and post-training.  Lower body kinematics of landing were notably different between gymnastics skills analysed. Joint positions at touchdown and range of motion available during landing due to these joint positions affect the ability to contribute to energy absorption. Peak ground reaction forces and peak accelerations measured at the pelvis showed significant differences between skills landing on both the hands and the feet. The peak acceleration during landing from gymnastics skills was positively correlated with the peak ground reaction force. A large variability stiffness during landing meant that an estimation of ground reaction force using simple modelling was not successful in improving the correlation. After a fatiguing jumping and landing task peak accelerations measured at the pelvis during landing were increased indicating the use of acceleration for identifying fatigue. Pilot field testing of acceleration during landing from gymnastics skills showed similar results to laboratory results. Pre- and post-training measurements showed no difference in peak accelerations during landing from the skills analysed. The training session completed was not demanding enough to induce enough fatigue to be seen in acceleration values Acceleration has potential to be used to quantify repeated loading and accumulative effects in gymnastics, as well as the presence of fatigue in gymnasts during training sessions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gymnastics.</field><field name="subject">Injury.</field><field name="subject">Repetitive loading.</field><field name="subject">Fatigue.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43910</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low power processor design</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Yu, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Power consumption is a critical design issue in embedded processors. As part of our low power processor design project, this thesis work aims to reduce power consumption on two typical processor components: Register File (RF), and Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU).  Register File is one of the most power hungry components in the processor, consuming about 20% of the processor power. The ALU is the working horse in the processor, responsible for almost all basic computing operations. Although ALU does not consume as high power as the register file, we observe that it can be power intensive in terms of power dissipation per silicon area unit and may result in a thermal hot spot in the processor.  Existing approaches to reduce power on the register file and ALU are effective. However, most of them either entail extensive hardware design efforts, or require a significant amount of work on post-compilation software code modification. The approaches proposed in this thesis avoid such problems. We only customize the internal structure of the processor components and keep the components&#146; interface to other system parts intact, so that the customization to a component is transparent to its external hardware design and no modification/alteration to other hardware components or to the software code is required. This customization strategy is well suitable to our whole low power processor design project and can be applied to any customization of an existing system for a given application.  We have applied our customization approaches to a set of benchmarks in a variety of application domains. Our experimental results show that the power savings on register file are in a range from 18.8% to 45.5%, an average of 29.7% register file power can be saved. For the arithmetic and logic unit, the power savings are from 43.5% to 49.6% and the average saving is 46.9% as compared to the original designs.  We also combine the customization of both the ALU and the register file. With the customizing of the ALU and the register file simultaneously, the processor power consumption can be reduced from 3.9% to 10.1%; on average, 6.44% processor power can be saved.  Most importantly, the power saving achievement is at the cost of neither hardware complexity nor processor performance, and the implementation is extremely straightforward and can be easily incorporated into a processor design environment, such as ASIPMeister  (a design tool, to automatically generate a VHDL model for application specificinstruction set processors) used in our research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Register files</field><field name="subject">Low power</field><field name="subject">ALU</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42608</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of evolutionary algorithms to engineering design</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Kevin</field><field name="description">The efficiency of the mechanical design process can be improved by the use of evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms provide a convenient and robust method to search for appropriate design solutions. Difficult non-linear problems are often encountered during the mechanical engineering design process. Solutions to these problems often involve computationally-intensive simulations. Evolutionary algorithms tuned to work with a small number of solution iterations can be used to automate the search for optimal solutions to these problems. An evolutionary algorithm was designed to give reliable results after a few thousand iterations; additionally the scalability and the ease of application to varied problems were considered. Convergence velocity of the algorithm was improved considerably by altering the mutation-based parameters in the algorithm. Much of this performance gain can be attributed to making the magnitude of the mutation and the minimum mutation rates self-adaptive. Three motorsport based design problems were simulated and the evolutionary algorithm was applied to search for appropriate solutions. The first two, a racing-line generator and a suspension kinematics simulation, were investigated to highlight properties of the evolutionary algorithm: reliability; solution representation; determining variable/performance relationships; and multiple objectives were discussed. The last of these problems was the lap-time simulation of a Formula SAE vehicle. This problem was solved with 32 variables, including a number of major conceptual differences. The solution to this optimisation was found to be significantly better than the 2004 UWA Motorsport vehicle, which finished 2nd in the 2005 US competition. A simulated comparison showed the optimised vehicle would score 62 more points (out of 675) in the dynamic events of the Formula SAE competition. Notably the optimised vehicle had a different conceptual design to the actual UWA vehicle. These results can be used to improve the design of future Formula SAE vehicles. The evolutionary algorithm developed here can be used as an automated search procedure for problems where performance solutions are computationally intensive.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation</field><field name="subject">Mechanical drawing</field><field name="subject">Motorsports</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0018</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First metatarsophalangeal joint range of motion : influence of ankle joint position and gastrocsoleus muscle stretching</field><field name="creator">North, Ian Graham</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] First metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ1) motion is an important factor in normal weight transference during walking. Disruptions to normal range can influence joints both proximal and distal to the MTPJ1, potentially leading to pain and dysfunction. Whilst the MTPJ1 has been investigated significantly, the numerous methodologies described to quantify range of motion can be questioned and makes comparisons difficult. Range of MTPJ1 motion is commonly assessed in a clinical setting to determine pathology as well as to make decisions on appropriate intervention. The anatomical and biomechanical influence of tendo Achilles load and MTPJ1 motion has been well described; however few studies measuring MTPJ1 range control for Achilles load or describe ankle joint positioning. Further to this the effects of reducing tendo Achilles stiffness on MTPJ1 extensions has yet to be investigated. The purpose of this study was to describe a technique to quantify passive MTPJ1 extension and to determine the influence of ankle joint position on joint range. Secondly the effect of calf muscle stretching on MTPJ1 range was also investigated. The information gathered will assist both research and clinical protocols for quantifying MTPJ1 range, and provide a greater understanding of the anatomic and biomechanical relationship between tendo Achilles load and MTPJ1 extension. In order to fulfil the purposes of the study it was necessary to establish a reliable methodology to quantify non weight bearing MTPJ1 extension. Reliability testing was undertaken in three parts. '...' The results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in joint range immediately following a one minute stretch for variables ankle joint range of motion as well as MTPJ1 extension for ankle joint plantar flexed at 10 Newton's and ankle joint neutral and plantar flexed at 30 Newtons. No significant differences were noted in ankle or MTPJ1 range of motion in either the control group on immediate re-testing, or in both groups after a one week stretch program. The findings of this study support those documented in the literature pertaining to the ankle joint position, tendo Achilles load and plantar fascial stiffness to MTPJ1 range of motion. Increased stiffness at the MTPJ1 was noted dependant on ankle joint position from ankle joint plantar flexion through to ankle joint dorsiflexion. This appears most likely due to increases in tendo Achilles load and subsequent forces transmitted to the plantar aponeurosis. The present study also demonstrated a trend towards increased joint extensibility and limb dominance. The study also supports previous literature into gender differences and joint extensibility, with a positive trend towards increased MTPJ1 range evident in the female subjects tested. The study also demonstrated the immediate effect of calf muscle stretching on ankle and MTPJ1 range of motion. It remains however unclear as to the exact mechanisms involved in producing increased joint range be it reflex inhibition or actual changes to the viscoelastic properties of the soft tissues. Despite this, no changes were evident following a one week stretching program, which supports previous literature describing a short lag time before soft tissues revert to baseline length properties following a single stretch session.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ankle -- Range of motion</field><field name="subject">Stretch (Physiology)</field><field name="subject">Hallux</field><field name="subject">Ankle joint</field><field name="subject">Range of motion</field><field name="subject">Stretching</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0021</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early agriculture and holocene environments in the Yangtze river delta, China</field><field name="creator">Atahan, Pia</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Environmental changes have had major impacts on past human societies across the globe, and a better understanding of this human-environment interaction is necessary for building societies with resilience towards future environmental change, and to effectively conserve areas of natural environments into the future. Regions such as the Yangtze delta, that have a long history of rice cultivation (dating to at least ca. 7000 BP) and a high density of prehistoric sites, provide an ideal backdrop to study both long-term human-environment interactions, and the environmental impacts of agricultural societies. This study aims to provide Holocene palaeoenvironmental reconstructions for three study sites in the Yangtze delta region, with the principle objectives of detecting human activity &#150; particularly that associated with the development of rice agriculture &#150; and identifying environmental changes within the palaeoenvironmental records. A parallel aim is to develop the use of quantitative biomarker and compound specific isotope analyses in Holocene palaeoenvironmental investigations, including in the detection of early agricultural environments, through analysis of sedimentary deposits. Palaeoenvironmental records for the three study sites, Qingpu, Guangfulin and Liangzhu, cover the time period from ca. 12,000 to ca. 400 BP.  '...' Greater proportions of coniferous and deciduous taxa early in the records (prior to ca. 7000 BP) indicate comparatively cooler conditions, while the increased abundance of Chenopodiaceae during that time suggests both cooler conditions and a greater marine influence in the region. Palaeoenvironmental data obtained during this study suggest agriculture in the delta region to have gradually increased in importance from ca. 7000 &#150; 2400 BP. The Guangfulin study site yielded the earliest evidence of agricultural activity, dating to ca. 7000 BP, principally in the form of a corresponding increase in Poaceae (Oryza comp.) abundance and decline of arboreal forest taxa. Subsequent periods of agricultural intensification are noted at ca. 5360 BP at Liangzhu and ca. 4700 BP at Guangfulin. Following the final period of intensification at Qingpu and Guangfulin (ca. 2400 BP), the extent of cultivated land in the delta region may have been comparable to modern times. Technological development during the early dynasties, particularly the greater availability of iron tools, is likely to have been a major factor driving the agricultural intensification detected ca. 2400 BP. The large tracts of natural vegetation detected by this research prior to ca. 2400 BP, would have afforded a degree of resilience to the human inhabitants of the delta region. Following the contraction of natural vegetation in the delta region, societies would have gained some resilience through access to the extensive trade network of the Chinese state. Resilience acquired through these means may, in part, account for the longevity of agricultural societies in the Yangtze delta region of China.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agriculture, Prehistoric -- Yangtze River Delta (China)</field><field name="subject">Holocene</field><field name="subject">Rice</field><field name="subject">Oryza</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0022</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of self-talk on self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and performance</field><field name="creator">Son, Veronica</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this study was to examine the impact of different types of self-talk (i.e., group-oriented self-talk versus individual-oriented self-talk) upon self-efficacy, collective efficacy, and performance of a dart-throwing task in a group setting.

Expression of the androgen receptor (AR), which mediates androgen action, is upregulated in breast cancer cells and the AR is the most frequently expressed steroid hormone receptor in breast tumours. AR levels and activity are modulated by the activity of other signalling pathways, however interactions between the AR and signalling pathways and the consequent alterations to the androgen responsiveness of breast cancer cells are largely uncharacterised. The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway is hyperactivated in ~30% of breast tumours and these tumours are often associated with low oestrogen receptor-a (ERa) levels, reduced responsiveness to antioestrogen therapies and an overall poorer prognosis. In this thesis, the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line which expresses ERa, progesterone receptor (PR) and the AR, was used to investigate ERK1/2-mediated regulation of the AR and the androgen responsiveness of cells. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signalling was achieved by treatment of cells with U0126, an inhibitor of MEK1/2, the upstream activator of ERK1/2. Hyperactivation of ERK1/2 signalling was achieved by stably transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active form of the MEK1 protein (&#191;MEK1), resulting in the isolation of two clonal cell populations stably expressing &#191;MEK1, &#191;C3 and &#191;6B, and a monoclonal cell line stably expressing the empty vector, MT3-1. Steady state AR mRNA levels, quantitated using real-time RT-PCR, were increased following U0126 treatment of MCF-7, MT3-1 and &#191;6B cells. Conversely, treatment of cells with 10-8M 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for up to 72 hours decreased AR mRNA levels, indicating that ERK1/2 hyperactivation did not alter the androgenresponsiveness of AR mRNA. '...' Overall levels of AR phosphorylation were enhanced in &#191;6B cells in the absence and presence of ligand, indicating that ERK1/2 hyperactivation either directly or indirectly induced receptor phosphorylation. The AR is localised in the cytoplasm in the absence of ligand and was more rapidly translocated to the nucleus in the presence of DHT in &#191;C3 cells, an effect that was abrogated in the presence of U0126, thereby indicating an ERK1/2-specific mechanism. AR transcriptional activity, measured using androgen responsive reporter plasmids was not significantly altered in &#191;6B cells in either the absence or presence of DHT, although the trend towards enhanced AR activity may be confirmed in future studies using optimised reporter assays. Consistent with the cell cycle regulatory functions of ERK1/2 signalling, proliferation of &#191;C3 cells and &#191;6B cells was increased in comparison to that of MT3-1 and MCF-7 cells. Treatment of &#191;C3 cells and MCF-7 cells with 10-10 &#150; 10-8M DHT produced similar inhibition of proliferation (~40%) during 8 days of culture, with no evidence of cytotoxicity. The results obtained in this thesis demonstrate that while ERK1/2 signalling regulates AR phosphorylation, processing and intracellular localisation, ERK1/2 hyperactivation in breast cancer cells does not inhibit the anti-proliferative effects of androgens. These findings support the development of tissue-specific androgenic treatments for breast tumours including poor prognosis tumours exhibiting ERK1/2 hyperactivation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Androgens -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Protein kinases</field><field name="subject">MAPK signalling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0024</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of cyclic behaviour of calcite cemented calcareous soils</field><field name="creator">Sharma Acharya, Shambhu Sagar</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract]  Characterising the behaviour of calcareous sediments that possess some degree of bonding between their constituents has attracted worldwide research interest in recent years.

In this type of interlocking the overall shape and arrangement of the building blocks are chosen in such a way that the movement of each block is prevented by its neighbours. (The methodological roots of topological interlocking can be found in two ancient structures: the arch and the dry stone wall.) The topological interlocking proper is achieved by two types of blocks: simple convex forms such as the Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron) that allow plate-like assemblies and specially engineered shapes of the block surfaces that also allow assembling corners. An important example of the latter &#150; so-called Osteomorphic block &#150; is the main object of this research with some insight being provided by numerical modelling of plates assembled from tetrahedra and cubes in the interlocking position. The main structural feature of the interlocking assemblies is the need of the peripheral constraint (for the Osteomorphic blocks this requirement can be relaxed to uni-directional constraint) to keep their integrity. We studied the least visible constraint structure &#150; internal pre-stressed cables which run through pre-fabricated holes in Osteomorphic blocks. It is shown that the pre-stressed steel cables can provide the necessary constraint force without creating appreciable residual stresses in the cables, however the points of connection of the cables are the weakest points and need special treatment. The main mechanical feature of the interlocking structures is the absence of block bonding. As a result, the blocks have a certain freedom of translational and rotational movement (within the kinematic constraints of the assembly) and their contacts have reduced shear stresses which hampers fracture propagation from one block to another. These features pre-determine the specific ways the interlocking assemblies behave under mechanical and dynamic impacts. These were studied in this project and the following results are reported. As the blocks in the interlocking structure are not connected, the main issue is the bearing capacity. The study of the least favourable, central point loading in the direction normal to the structure shows elevated large-scale fracture toughness (resistance to fracture propagation). However when the central force imposes considerable bending the generated tensile membrane stresses assist fracturing of the loaded block. Prevention of bending considerably enhances the strength therefore the most efficient application of the interlocking structures would be in protective coatings and covers. Furthermore, proper selection of the material properties and the interface friction can increase the system overall strength and bearing capacity. The results of the computer simulations suggest that both Young&#146;s modulus and the friction coefficient are the key parameters whose increase improves the bearing capacity of topologically interlocking assemblies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Unit construction</field><field name="subject">Blocks (Building materials) -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Blocks (Building materials) -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Topological interlocking</field><field name="subject">Osteomorphic block</field><field name="subject">Mortarless constitution</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0026</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an optimal method for producing a tearless onion</field><field name="creator">Kamoi, T.</field><field name="description">People experience the irritating tearing and burning sensation of lachrymatory factor (LF, propanthial S-oxide) when cutting or chopping onion bulbs. LF is produced by lachrymatory factor synthase (LFS) specifically from 1-propenyl sulfenic acid, a breakdown product of trans-1-propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (1-PRENCSO) by alliinase. This thesis describes strategies to produce a tearless onion by using RNA interference (RNAi) silencing. To determine whether a gene silencing cassette can silence lfs gene transcripts from onion (Allium cepa L.), a crop recalcitrant to genetic transformation, a gene silencing assessment system was developed by using a model plant as a host for the gene of interest. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants transgenic for LFS enzyme activity from onion were first produced by introducing a CaMV 35S-onion-lfs gene construct. These plants were then subjected to a second transformation with an RNAi construct directed against the lfs gene sequence. LFS enzyme activity assay showed that the transgenic plants, containing both the lfs gene and the RNAi construct, had significantly reduced LFS activity. This observation was supported by Western analysis for the LFS protein and further validated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis that demonstrated a significant reduction in the lfs transcript level in the dual transformants. This work demonstrated that the RNAi construct is a suitable candidate for the development of a tearless onion. This model plant RNAi system has wide reaching applications for assessment and targeting of plant secondary pathway genes, from poorly studied or recalcitrant plant species, that are important in pharmacological, food and process industries. The functional RNAi vector identified in the model system was transformed into onion. Endogenous lfs transcript levels were successfully reduced by up to 43-fold in six transgenic lines. In consequence, LFS enzyme activity was decreased by up to 1573-fold and this observation was supported by Western analysis for the LFS protein. Furthermore, the production of the deterrent LF upon tissue disruption was reduced up to 67-fold. Subjective olfactory assessment of silenced lines indicated that the pungent odour given off by the leaf and bulb material was much reduced compared with that of non-transgenic counterparts, and that this was replaced by a sweeter milder onion odour. A novel colorimetric assay demonstrated that this silencing had shifted the 1-PRENCSO breakdown pathway so that by reducing LFS protein, more 1-propenyl sulfenic acid was converted into di-1-propenyl thiosulfinate. A consequence of the raised thiosulfinates levels was a marked increase in the downstream production of a non-enzymatically produced zwiebelane isomer that has never previously been identified, and other volatile compounds, di-1-propenyl disulfides and 2-mercapto-3,4-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrothiophenes, which had previously been reported either in small amounts or had not been detected in onions. These raised volatile sulfur compounds provide an explanation for the unique flavour notes of the LF reduced onion and are predicted to have health benefits akin to those found in garlic. These results demonstrated that silencing of LFS enzyme activity by introducing an RNAi construct directed against the lfs gene sequence simultaneously reduced levels of the deterrent LF and increased the desirable thiosulfinates in onions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">onion</field><field name="subject">lachrymatory factor synthase</field><field name="subject">propanthial S-oxide</field><field name="subject">RNA interference</field><field name="subject">gene silencing</field><field name="subject">model system</field><field name="subject">colorimetric assay</field><field name="subject">thiosulfinates</field><field name="subject">zwiebelane isomer</field><field name="subject">disulfides</field><field name="subject">dihydrothiophenes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270800 Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1008</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy of a pedometer based intervention in increasing physical activity in cardiac patients in the community</field><field name="creator">Butler, Lyra, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rationale Within Australia, cardiac rehabilitation attendance is poor, with typically thirty percent of eligible patients attending programs. The majority of cardiac patients are not receiving the support or detailed information required to increase physical activity participation after hospitalisation. Further, many cardiac patients are not exercising independently, regardless of their attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. As physical activity is important in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, there could be substantial benefits to the individual and cost savings for the health system if cardiac patients were more active. Physical activity interventions based on social cognitive theory have demonstrated success in improving physical activity among people with chronic diseases. However, there is little research conducted with cardiac patients, in particular, with those who do not attend cardiac rehabilitation. This research addresses this gap in public health practice by providing an intervention to cardiac patients, irrespective of their attendance at cardiac rehabilitation, thereby addressing a population that is often overlooked and hard to reach.  Research aims ??	To determine the uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation in the north Illawarra and Shoalhaven areas of New South Wales and identify the characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation attendees and non attendees. ??	To evaluate the efficacy of a pedometer based physical activity intervention in cardiac patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation. Methodology This thesis consisted of three related studies: a cross sectional analysis of the characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation referrals (n = 944) over a 10 month period; and two randomised controlled trials conducted simultaneously. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial participants (n = 110) were patients who had attended cardiac rehabilitation; Community Trial participants (n = 215) were those who did not attend cardiac rehabilitation. The six week intervention evaluated in the trials included self monitoring of daily physical activity using a pedometer and step calendar, and two behavioural counselling and goal setting sessions delivered via telephone. Additional support for intervention group participants was provided through two brief telephone calls made after the six week intervention period. Self reported physical activity levels were collected at baseline, six weeks and six months. The questionnaire also collected information about psychosocial factors affecting physical activity participation. The exercise capacity of the participants in the Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial was objectively measured at baseline, six weeks and six months using a gas exchange analysis system. Results The cardiac rehabilitation uptake rate was 28.8 per cent of referred patients. Cardiac rehabilitation attendees were significantly younger and more likely to have had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure than non attendees.  Study groups in both trials were not significantly different at baseline. In the Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial, improvements in total weekly physical activity sessions (p=0.002), walking time (p=0.013) and walking sessions (p&lt;0.001) in the intervention group were significantly greater than the change in the control group at the end of the six week intervention. At six months, improvements in the intervention group remained significantly greater than the control group in total physical activity time (p=0.044), total physical activity sessions (p=0.016) and walking sessions (p=0.035) after adjusting for baseline differences. These self reported behavioural changes were corroborated by improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness at six months in the intervention group (p=0.010). Improvements in the intervention group in behavioural (p=0.039) and cognitive (p=0.024) self management strategy use were significantly greater than the controls at six weeks after adjusting for baseline differences. The improvement in cognitive strategy use (p=0.001) remained significantly greater in the intervention group compared to controls at six months after adjusting for baseline differences. Self efficacy, outcome expectancies and psychological distress were not significantly different between groups at six weeks or six months after adjusting for baseline differences. In the Community Trial, improvements in total weekly physical activity time (p=0.027), total physical activity sessions (p=0.003), walking time (p=0.013) and walking sessions (p=0.002) in the intervention group were significantly greater than the control group at six weeks after adjusting for baseline differences. At six months, improvements in total physical activity time (p=0.015), total physical activity sessions (p=0.019), walking time (p=0.002) and walking sessions (p=0.026) in the intervention group remained significantly greater than the control group after adjusting for baseline differences. Improvements in outcome expectancies (p=0.038) and cognitive self management strategy use (p=0.028) in the intervention group were significantly greater than the change in the control group at six weeks, after adjusting for baseline differences. However, these differences did not remain significant at six months.  Conclusion This research showed that participation in a six week pedometer based intervention significantly increased the physical activity level and psychosocial status of people with heart disease. These findings suggest the pedometer based intervention could be offered as an effective and accessible option for those who do not attend cardiac rehabilitation to increase their physical activity levels. This intervention could also be promoted as an important adjunct to existing cardiac rehabilitation programs to promote adherence to physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation attendance. These studies provide community based evidence of an effective physical activity intervention for those eligible for cardiac rehabilitation, including those who do not attend. This provides a public health approach to cardiac rehabilitation programs and has the potential to improve health outcomes in this population.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedometer</field><field name="subject">cardiac rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">randomised controlled trial</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42056</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume: Astrolabe Park, Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jorstad, Lange B., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spatial and temporal variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume is examined to determine the mechanisms responsible for the observed variation, and to provide an assessment of the implications of this variation with respect to the interpretation of monitoring data, specifically with regards to its application to geochemical modelling. An integrated approach to field investigation was utilised in this study, including sample collection from a network of standard and bundled piezometers, surface and borehole geophysical investigation techniques, and a manometer board for the measurement of hydraulic head in bundled piezometers. Nine groundwater sampling events were conducted over a 12 month period, with sample analyses comprising field measurement of water quality parameters and redox sensitive elements, and laboratory analysis for major and trace elements and stable isotopes (??18O, ??2H, ??13C-DIC, ??15N). The vertical position of the centre of mass of the leachate plume was observed to vary up to 2 metres between monitoring events, and concentrations of key indicator parameters were observed to fluctuate by as much as 160%. The electrical images created by surface resistivity transects along a groundwater flow path between the landfill and a groundwater-fed pond a short distance downgradient suggest a plume configuration characterised by discrete pulses of concentrated leachate migrating in a conservative manner between the landfill and the pond. It is hypothesized that these leachate slugs are flushed into the aquifer during sustained periods of rainfall, presumed to be a significant driver of leachate mobilisation into the underlying aquifer. The most significant hydrogeochemical processes affecting contaminant mobilisation, transport and attenuation in the leachate-impacted shallow aquifer included microbial degradation of organic waste, dissolution of inorganic waste, ion exchange, precipitation of sulfide and carbonate minerals, mixing with rainfall recharge along flow path, and redox transformations along the plume fringe. These processes are supported by hydrogeochemical data analysis, and generally agree with the results of inverse geochemical modelling. While analysis of detailed groundwater monitoring appears to provide a plausible description of the plume dynamics, the results of the electrical resistivity transects indicates a more varied and complex plume configuration than is suggested by the borehole data alone. This integration of investigation techniques underscores the inherent inadequacy of even a high-resolution monitoring well network to accurately describe the full extent of variation in time and space within a contaminant plume, even in a relatively simple aquifer environment, and accentuates the potentially significant limitations of site-scale hydrogeochemical interpretation based solely on borehole monitoring data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">plumes (Fluid dynamics).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23427</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amalgam restorations and mercury toxicity</field><field name="creator">Sheridan, Peter</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental amalgams -- Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Dentists -- Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Mercury -- Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4412</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An overview of dental assistant utilisation (DAU) and recommendations for the establishment of an undergraduate DAU programme in Australia</field><field name="creator">McLaughlan, Anthony Charles</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1992</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Westmead Centre.

As teachers and speech pathologists have the most professional contact with children with language impairment, they would benefit from access to suitable music activities. As it cannot be assumed that they have musical training, activities must be designed to be easy to use and adapt. The main aims of the study were (1) to determine whether a range of music activities designed to teach specific language skills were suitable for language intervention programmes, and (2) to ascertain the extent to which teachers and speech pathologists could use these activities (and similar activities) in language intervention. A preliminary survey of Grade Two teachers in Language Development Centres (LDCs) in Perth, Western Australia provided the basis for specific skills to be targeted. Music activities were designed and implemented with a Grade Two class in a Language Development Centre. Four of the students were selected as case studies in order to evaluate the impact of the activities. The classroom teacher was also studied as a case example to determine the usefulness of the activities for professionals with no musical training. Additionally, surveys of teachers in LDCs and speech pathologists (both public facilities and private practice) working with children in the Perth metropolitan region were conducted. Evaluations by the researcher, classroom teacher, a speech pathologist and the four student case studies indicated that the activities designed in this study addressed the specific language goals appropriately, were suitable for use with groups, and that the students were learning and developing the targeted language skills. In addition, the activities were suitable for use by professionals with little musical background, and were perceived by the teacher to be adaptable for different skill levels and age groups. This suggests that music can be effectively used in semantic, pragmatic and oral narrative intervention for primary school aged children with specific language impairment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Specific language impairment in children</field><field name="subject">Music therapy for children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0027</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient stability-constrained load dispatch, ancillary services allocation and transient stability assessment procedures for secure power system operation</field><field name="creator">Karimishad, Amir</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The present thesis is devoted to the development of new methods for transient stability-constrained optimal power flow, probabilistic transient stability assessment and security-constrained ancillary services allocation. The key objective of the thesis is to develop novel dispatch and assessment methods for power systems operation in the new environment of electricity markets to ensure power systems security, particularly transient stability. A new method for economic dispatch together with nodal price calculations which includes transient stability constraints and, at the same time, optimises the reference inputs to the Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices for maintaining power systems transient stability and reducing nodal prices is developed. The method draws on the sensitivity analysis of time-domain transient stability simulation results to derive a set of linearised stability constraints expressed in terms of generator active powers and FACTS devices input references. '...'  The low computing time requirement of the two-point estimate method allows online applications, and the use of detailed power systems dynamic model for time-domain simulation which offers high accuracy. The two-point estimate method is integrated in a straightforward manner with the existing transient stability analysis tools. The integrated software facility has potential applications in control rooms to assist the system operator in decision making process based on instability risks. The software system when implemented on a cluster of processors also makes it feasible to re-assess online transient stability for any change in system configuration arising from switching control. The method proposed has been tested on a representative power system and validated using the Monte Carlo simulation. In conjunction with the energy market, by which forecasted load demand is met by generator dispatch, ancillary services are required in relation to control for secure system operation and power quality. The final part of the thesis has a focus on the key aspect of allocating these ancillary services, subject to an important constraint that the dispatch of the ancillary services will not impair the system security achieved in the load dispatch. With this focus and requirement, the thesis develops a new dispatch formulation in which the network security constraints are represented in the optimal determination of generator active power schedule and allocation of ancillary services. Contingencies considered include power demand variations at individual load nodes from the values specified for the current dispatch calculation. The required changes in generator active powers to meet the new load demands are represented by additional control variables in the new dispatch formulation which augment those variables in the traditional OPF dispatch calculation. Based on the Lagrange function which includes the extended set of security constraints, the formulation derives the optimality condition to be satisfied by the dispatch solution, together with the marginal prices for individual ancillary service providers and LMPs. The effects of the security constraints are investigated and discussed. Case studies for representative power systems are presented to verify the new dispatch calculation procedure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power system stability</field><field name="subject">Transients (Electricity)</field><field name="subject">Transient stability</field><field name="subject">Ancillary services</field><field name="subject">Optimal power flow</field><field name="subject">Probabalistic transient stability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0028</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shark Bay 1616-1991 : the spread of science and the emergence of ecology in a World Heritage area</field><field name="creator">Christensen, Joseph</field><field name="description">Shark Bay is an extensive marine embayment located on the central coast of Western Australia that is recognised as a World Heritage Property on the basis of the Outstanding Universal Value of the natural environment of the region. This thesis examines the history of science at Shark Bay between the arrival of the first European explorers in the seventeenth century through to the official recognition of Shark Bay as a World Heritage Area in 1991. Each of the seven chapters is devoted to a different period in the development of scientific investigations, beginning with Dutch and English mariners and naturalists, passing on to French scientific explorers and British surveyors naturalists, and explorers, continuing through a variety of investigations in marine science and research in biogeography and evolution carried out by foreign expeditions and Australian field-workers, and culminating in the transformation of scientific investigations as a result of the rise and development of modern ecological science in the second half of the twentieth century. This development of science at Shark Bay is considered in light of existing frameworks for the development or spread of science in Australia, and in relation to current literature concerning the development or emergence of ecology in Australia. After evaluating the history of science at Shark Bay relative to existing knowledge of the spread of science and the emergence of ecology, the thesis concludes by proposing a new framework for the development of science and the emergence of ecology based on the experience at Shark Bay and with wider application to the history of science in Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Natural areas -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Science -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">World Heritage areas -- Western Australia -- Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">Shark Bay Region (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">History of science - Shark Bay</field><field name="subject">History of ecology - Western Australia</field><field name="subject">History of science - Western Australia</field><field name="subject">History of ecology - Shark Bay</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0029</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative molecular physiology of salt and waterlogging tolerance in Lotus tenius and L. corniculatus : towards a perennial pasture legume for saline land</field><field name="creator">Teakle, Natasha Lea</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Salinity and waterlogging interact to reduce the growth of most crop and pasture species. Species that are productive on saline-waterlogging land are needed for Australian farming systems. One option is Lotus tenuis, a perennial legume widely grown for pasture in the flood-prone and salt-affected Pampa region of Argentina. To identify mechanisms responsible for the adverse interaction between salinity and waterlogging, Lotus tenuis with a reputation for tolerance was compared with L. corniculatus, the most widely cultivated Lotus species. The physiology of salt and waterlogging tolerance in L. tenuis (4 cultivars) was evaluated, and compared with L. corniculatus (3 cultivars). Overall, L. tenuis cultivars accumulated less Na+ and Cl-, and more K+ in shoots than L. corniculatus cultivars, when exposed to 200 mM NaCl for 28 d in aerated or in anoxic (stagnant agar) solutions. In a NaCl dose response experiment (0 to 400 mM NaCl in aerated solution), Lotus tenuis (cv. Chaja) accumulated half as much Cl- in its shoots than L. corniculatus (cv. San Gabriel) at all external NaCl concentrations, and about 30% less shoot Na+ in treatments above 250 mM NaCl. Ion distributions in shoots were determined for plants at 200 mM NaCl; L. tenuis (cv. Chaja) accumulated about half as much Cl- in old leaves, young leaves and stems, compared with concentrations in L. corniculatus (cv. San Gabriel). There were not, however, significant differences between the two species for Na+ concentrations in the various shoot tissues under aerated NaCl treatment.  '...'   Therefore, during early stages of exposure to salinity, L. tenuis accumulated a higher proportion of total Na+ in the roots under combined stagnant-plus-NaCl treatment (55% versus 39% for L. corniculatus). Na+ transporters, particularly those relying on H+ gradients across membranes, which in turn require adequate ATP levels, could be impaired under O2 deficits that inhibit respiration. To study the effect of O2 deficiency on a Na+ transporter, an NHX1-like gene was cloned from L. tenuis and identity established via sequencing and yeast complementation studies. Real-time qPCR showed expression of NHX1 in L. tenuis roots increased under stagnant-plus-NaCl treatment, whereas it was reduced in L. corniculatus. Thus, maintaining O2 transport to roots, together with up-regulation of an NHX1-like gene for Na+ accumulation in vacuoles, contributes to tolerance of L. tenuis to combined salinity and waterlogging stresses. This study highlights the importance of minimising Cl- transport to shoots as a mechanism of salt tolerance and has identified a CCC-like gene in L. tenuis as a candidate for mediating root-to-shoot Cl- transport. Under combined stagnant-plus-NaCl treatment, control of Na+ transport is another mechanism contributing to tolerance in these Lotus species. Enhanced root aeration in L. tenuis maintains root Na+ transport processes, such as accumulation in vacuoles via NHX1-like genes, to diminish xylem loading to the shoot. Overall, this thesis has contributed new knowledge on the potential of Lotus tenuis as a saltland pasture and has significantly enhanced current understanding on the mechanisms of salinity and waterlogging tolerance in plants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging (Soils)</field><field name="subject">Lotus -- Soils</field><field name="subject">Na+ and Cl-</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0030</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The health outcomes of women exposed to blue asbestos at Wittenoom</field><field name="creator">Reid, Alison</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis examines the health outcomes of women exposed to blue asbestos at Wittenoom, Western Australia.

The critical step in this examination is the accurate identification of specimens collected ensuring the application of appropriate species-specific developmental data. Current molecular techniques in the identification of forensically important Calliphoridae species from the Australian region have been explored and found to be a highly significant and valuable area of research. The cytochrome oxidase genes in the mitochondrial genome have been shown to have sufficient sequence diversity to distinguish forensically relevant Calliphoridae species. In order to target the observed sequence diversity within relevant regions of the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes, sequence specific primer (SSP) pairs are used to target polymorphisms, resulting in the amplification of specific species. This technique has proven to be both a rapid and successful identification tool in the analysis of insect taxa, especially Culicidae. SSP typing is particularly useful, as it requires no subsequent sequencing or restriction with enzymes, both of which require additional time and reagents. The aim of this research was to develop a multiplex SSP reaction for the identification of forensically important Calliphoridae species. Seven SSP pairs preliminarily designed by Harvey (2006) were utilised in the identification of Calliphora dubia, Calliphora albifrontalis, Chrysomya rufifacies, Chrysomya megacephala and Lucilia sericata. Once optimised the SSP pairs were developed into two multiplex PCR reactions. This thesis presents the experiments performed, analysis conducted and results obtained through the development of the multiplex SSP-PCR system. Initial testing of the seven preliminarily designed SSP pairs conveyed non-concordance between expected and observed results. Additional species were continually amplified, even after extensive optimisation attempts, including alternations to annealing temperature, MgCl2 and primer concentration. Of the 7 SSP pairs, 6 were re-designed to improve specificity, whilst one was removed from further testing and replaced with 2 newly designed primer pairs. 15 Continual testing of 8 SSP pairs was conducted, but only 6 could be successfully optimised. Optimisation was limited to alterations to annealing temperature, to allow for potential multiplexing. To confirm the regions and species amplified, sequencing of the PCR products was performed. Though only partial sequences were obtained for most samples the alignment shows the expected region amplified with specific species variations. Using the remaining 6 SSP pairs all species tested were identifiable, allowing for multiplexing potential to be tested. Multiplex PCR is a cost effective and efficient technique that is becoming increasing popular within a wide range of scientific disciplines. To date there has been no recorded use of this technique in relation to either forensic entomology or the analysis of forensically important Calliphoridae species. The 6 SSP pairs were manipulated to produce one successful multiplex PCR system using 3 SSP pairs to identify L. sericata, Ch. rufifacies and Ch. megacephala, and one unsuccessful multiplex PCR that amplified a single SSP pair for the identification of C. dubia and Ch. rufifacies. When both reactions are utilised, it is possible to identify all 5 forensically important Calliphoridae species tested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blowflies -- Identification</field><field name="subject">Forensic entomology</field><field name="subject">Molecular identity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0032</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DNA analysis of human skeletal remains associated with the Batavia mutiny of 1629</field><field name="creator">Yahya, Padillah</field><field name="description">In this thesis human skeletal remains believed to be the victims of the Batavia Mutiny of 1629 were subjected to DNA analysis. So far the remains of 10 individuals (of which 9 were available for this study) have been exhumed from Beacon Island, in the Houtman&#146;s Abrolhos, off the coast of Western Australia. The remains are now stored in the Western Australia Maritime Museum (WAMM) in Fremantle. In this research an attempt is made to type ancient DNA (aDNA) from the remains of the Batavia Mutiny, which are almost 400 years old. Previous anthropological studies have been performed on these remains in order to assign sex, age and stature. The aim of the present project is to study the familial relationships of the remains and to determine their sex based on molecular genetic analysis. In order to protect the invaluable museum specimens and minimise the risk of contamination from exogenous contemporary DNA, a tooth sample from each available individual (designated A15507, A16316, A15831, M3901, SK5, SK6, SK7, SK8 and SK9) was subjected to DNA extraction. Comparison and optimisation of DNA extraction methods from more recent teeth samples was performed in order to determine the most suitable method for the DNA extraction of the ancient teeth samples. Three types of genetic markers were analysed in an attempt to study the familial relationships and determine the sex of each individual. Multiplex primers (Hummel, 2003) which simultaneously amplify the HV1 and HV2 regions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were used in this research to analyse familial relationships. These primers were selected because of their ability to amplify small fragments (131bp, 168bp and 217bp) of DNA template, which suit the nature of aDNA samples. Primers published by Sullivan et al.(1993), which amplify a 106bp region on chromosome X and 112bp on chromosome Y of the amelogenin gene, were used to determine sex. In addition, short tandem repeat (STR) marker were also analysed to determine familial and sex using the AmpFlSTR&#174;Profiler PlusTMPCR kit from Applied Biosystems. The PCR conditions of all primers were optimised before usage on the Batavia remains. As aDNA analysis is prone to contamination, stringent precautions were undertaken throughout this research. Despite this, contamination is suspected in some of the mtDNA sequences obtained (particularly from SK5, SK7, A15507 and A15831), which most probably came from the positive control used in the optimisation analysis. For these samples the sequences for the HV2 region were poor and polymorphisms relative to a reference were similar to each other and to the positive control profile. However, some conclusions have been made on other individuals (SK8, SK9, M3901, A16316) based on the HV1 and HV2 sequences obtained. Based on two or more different polymorphisms observed in the individuals it was concluded that it is likely there is no maternal relationship between individuals A16316 and SK8, SK9 and M3901 and between individuals SK8, M3901 and SK9. However these results require repetition for confirmation. The attempt to type the amelogenin gene on chromosomes X and Y was unsuccessful most likely due to the poor preservation of the remains. It is apparent from this research that although it was possible to extract aDNA (especially multicopy mtDNA) from teeth material that were almost 400 years old, the main hurdle in this aDNA analysis was contamination and DNA degradation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Batavia (Ship)</field><field name="subject">DNA -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">DNA, Fossil</field><field name="subject">Human skeleton -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Shipwrecks -- Western Australia -- Houtman Abrolhos</field><field name="subject">DNA analysis</field><field name="subject">Batavia Mutiny 1629</field><field name="subject">Human skeletal remains</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0034</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diet and trophic role of western rock lobsters (Panulirus cygnus George) in temperate Western Australian deep-coastal ecosystems (35-60m)</field><field name="creator">Waddington, Kris Ian</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Removal of consumers through fishing has been shown to influence ecosystem structure and function by changing the biomass and composition of organisms occupying lower trophic levels. The western rock lobster (Panurilus cygnus), an abundant consumer along the temperate west coast of Australia, forms the basis of Australia's largest single species fishery, with catches frequently exceeding 11000 tonnes annually. Despite their high abundance and commercial importance, the diet and trophic role of adult lobster populations in deep-coastal-ecosystems (35-60 m) remains unknown. An understanding of the diet and trophic role of lobsters in these ecosystems is a key component of the assessment of ecosystem effects of the western rock lobster fishery. This study uses gut content and stable isotope analyses to determine the diet and trophic role of lobsters in deep-coastal ecosystems. Dietary analysis indicated adult lobsters in deep-coastal ecosystems were primarily carnivorous with diet reflecting food available on the benthos. Gut content analyses indicate crabs (62 %) and amphipods/isopods (~10 %) are the most important lobster dietary sources. Stable isotope analysis indicates natural diet of lobsters in deep coastal ecosystems is dominated by amphipods/isopods (contributing up to ~50 %) and crabs (to ~75 %), with bivalves/gastropods, red algae and sponges of lesser importance (&lt;10 % of diet each). Diet of lobsters in deep-coastal ecosystems differed from that reported for lobsters inhabiting shallow water ecosystems in this region, reflecting differences in food availability and food choice between these ecosystems. Bait from the fishery was also determined (by stable isotope analyses) to be a significant dietary component of lobsters in deep-coastal ecosystems, contributing between 10 and 80 % of lobster food requirements at some study locations.  '...'   Given observed effects of organic matter addition in trawl fisheries, and also associated with aquaculture, bait addition is likely to have implications for processes occurring within deep-coastal ecosystems in this region, particularly given its oligotrophic status, most likely by increasing the food available to scavenging species. Removal of lobsters from deep-coastal ecosystems may affect the composition and abundance of lobster prey communities through a reduction in predation pressure. Such effects have been demonstrated for other spiny lobster species. These effects are typically most observable amongst common prey taxa which in other studies have been commonly herbivores. In deep-coastal ecosystems, crabs and amphipods/isopods are the most common prey taxa and most likely to be effected. The ecosystem-impacts of top-down control of non-herbivorous prey species is unknown and constrains the inferences possible from this study. However, the establishment of 'no-take' areas in deep-coastal ecosystems would allow the ecosystem effects of lobster removal to be further assessed in these deep-coastal ecosystems. While data from the current study did not allow the ecosystem effects of lobster removal to be properly assessed, this study provided information regarding the ecology of western rock lobsters in previously unstudied ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lobsters -- Food</field><field name="subject">Food chains (Ecology)</field><field name="subject">Panulirus cygnus</field><field name="subject">Western rock lobster -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Fishing baits -- Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Spiny lobsters</field><field name="subject">Bait subsidy</field><field name="subject">Mass balance model</field><field name="subject">Trophic relationships</field><field name="subject">Deep-coastal ecosystems</field><field name="subject">Fractionation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0035</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and control coordination of power systems with FACTS devices in steady-state operating mode</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van Liem</field><field name="description">This thesis is devoted to the development of new models for a recently-implemented FACTS (flexible alternating current transmission system) device, the unified power flow controller (UPFC), and the control coordination of power systems with FACTS devices in steady-state operating mode. The key objectives of the research reported in the thesis are, through online control coordination based on the models of power systems having FACTS devices, those of maximising the network operational benefit and restoring system static security following a disturbance or contingency. Based on the novel concept of interpreting the updated voltage solutions at each iteration in the Newton-Raphson (NR) power-flow analysis as dynamic variables, the thesis first develops a procedure for representing the unified power flow controllers (UPFCs) in the steady-state evaluation. Both the shunt converter and series converter control systems of a UPFC are modeled in their dynamical form with the discrete time variable replaced by the NR iterative step in the power-flow analysis. The key advantage of the model developed is that of facilitating the process of UPFC constraint resolution during the NR solution sequence. Any relative priority in control functions pre-set in the UPFC controllers is automatically represented in the power-flow formulation. Although the developed UPFC model based on the dynamic simulation of series and shunt converter controllers is flexible and general, the number of NR iterations required for convergence can be large. Therefore, the model is suitable mainly for power system planning and design studies. For online control coordination, the thesis develops the second UPFC model based on nodal voltages. The model retains all of the flexibility and generality of the dynamic simulation-based approach while the number of iterations required for solution convergence is independent of the UPFC controller dynamic responses. Drawing on the constrained optimisation based on Newton&#146;s method together with the new UPFC model expressed in terms of nodal voltages, a systematic and general method for determining optimal reference inputs to UPFCs in steady-state operation is developed. The method is directly applicable to UPFCs operation with a high-level line optimisation control (LOC) for maximising the network operational benefit. By using a new continuation technique with adaptive parameter, the algorithm for solving the constrained optimisation problem extends substantially the region of convergence achieved with the conventional Newton&#146;s method. Having established the foundation provided by the comprehensive models developed for representing power systems with FACTS devices including the UPFC, the research, in the second part, focuses on real-time control coordination of power system controllers, with the main purpose of restoring power system static security following a disturbance or contingency. At present, as the cost of phasor measurement units (PMUs) and wide-area communication network is on the decrease, the research proposes and develops a new secondary voltage control where voltages at all of the load nodes are directly controlled, using measured voltages.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power distribution</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Control</field><field name="subject">Electric power transmission</field><field name="subject">Flexible AC transmission systems</field><field name="subject">Power system modeling</field><field name="subject">Secondary voltage control</field><field name="subject">FACTS device</field><field name="subject">Power system control coordination</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0036</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of the microbial decomposer community to the burial of skeletal muscle tissue in contrasting soils</field><field name="creator">Luitingh, Taryn Leigh</field><field name="description">Microorganisms are known to be agents involved in the decomposition of organic matter. However, little is known about the participation of the microbial communities during the decomposition of mammalian skeletal muscle tissue. This study investigates the capacity of the soil microbial community to adapt to the decomposition of skeletal muscle tissue in differing soils. This has implications for the study of mass graves and sites of repeated burial. A controlled laboratory experiment was designed to assess the adaptability of microbial communities present in three distinct soil types (sand, loamy sand and sandy clay loam) found near Perth, Western Australia. This experiment was split into two main stages. The initial decomposition stage involved the addition of porcine skeletal muscle tissue (SMT) (Sus scrofa) to each of the three soil types which were then left to decompose for a period of time. Controls were run in parallel, which had no porcine SMT present. The second decomposition stage involved a second addition of SMT to the soils obtained from the initial decomposition stage. Therefore, for each soil, SMT was either decomposed in the soil that had been pre-exposed to SMT or not. The rate of decomposition, microbial activity (CO2 respiration) and microbial biomass (substrate-induced respiration) were monitored during the second decomposition stage. The functional diversity of the microbial populations in the soil were assessed using Community-Level Physiological Profiling (CLPP). Across the three soil types, the re-introduction of SMT to the soil has led to its enhanced decomposition (measured by tissue mass loss and microbial activity) by the microbial communities. This microbial adaptation may have been facilitated by a functional change in the soil microbial communities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic taphonomy</field><field name="subject">Human decomposition</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="subject">Soil microbiology</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Forensic taphonomy</field><field name="subject">CO2 respiration</field><field name="subject">CLPP</field><field name="subject">Microbial community</field><field name="subject">Microbial decomposition</field><field name="subject">Microbial adaptation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0037</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The joint hedging and leverage decision</field><field name="creator">Gould, John</field><field name="description">The validating roles of hedging and leverage as value-adding corporate strategies arise from their beneficial manipulation of deadweight market impositions such as taxes and financial distress costs. These roles may even be symbiotic in their value-adding effects, but they are antithetic in their effects on company risk. This study's modelling analysis indicates that hedging and leverage do interact for net benefit to company value; for sensible base-case exogenous parameters, the optimal (value-maximising) joint hedging and leverage strategy increases company value by about 4.0% compared to the unhedged optimal leverage strategy, by about 1.3% compared to the unlevered optimal hedge strategy, and by about 4.0% compared to the company being unlevered and unhedged. Furthermore an optimal joint hedging and leverage strategy is less financially risky than an unhedged optimal leverage strategy or an unhedged and unlevered strategy, and is often less financially risky than an unlevered optimal hedge strategy. Interestingly, the optimal joint hedging and leverage strategy entails some risk-seeking hedge reversal in response to weak price outcomes for production output.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Finance</field><field name="subject">Financial leverage</field><field name="subject">Hedging (Finance)</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Hedging</field><field name="subject">Risk management</field><field name="subject">Leverage</field><field name="subject">Capital structure</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0038</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of intergovernmental collaboration in tourism among Asean nations.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Emma P. Y., Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">There often exists a skepticism regarding the feasibility and effectiveness of ASEAN tourism collaboration. The competitive nature of tourism, and the development gap between less-developed and developed member countries are some of the reasons ASEAN tourism is little more than a political gesture to the skeptics. In reality, the collaboration is slow-moving. Little is known about its mechanism let alone ways to improve it. Despite the continuous cooperative endeavor among the member nations since 1998 and the significant economic contribution tourism makes in the region, the ASEAN tourism phenomenon receives little attention from researchers. Hence, this research aims to answer two questions: (1) How do ASEAN countries collaborate in tourism? (2) What can be done to improve the collaboration? This research adopts a case study approach. It involves the formulation of theoretical propositions based on literature in political science and behavioral science. Primary data were collected from key stakeholders of ASEAN tourism by means of in-depth interviews. A total of twenty-one individuals participated. They represented nine out of the ten member governments, international organizations, industry associations, the academia, and consultancies. During the final stage of the research, congruence and discrepancies between the theoretical propositions and the empirical findings were identified, and a model of ASEAN tourism collaboration was constructed. One of the key findings is a recipe for success in intergovernmental tourism collaboration. It was found that three categories of factors facilitate ASEAN tourism collaboration and its implementation of policies: stakeholders ? especially the political will and commitment of national leaders; resources ? the technical and financial assistance provided by ASEAN dialogue partners; and cooperation management ? a flexible and ?conservative progressive? approach with a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The contribution of this study is threefold. First, it fills an empirical gap by investigating a little yet known phenomenon that is politically and economically significant. Second, it contributes to theory development by extending the contextual boundaries of existing theories in intergovernmental collaboration. Finally, it provides directional and pragmatic policy recommendations on how to facilitate the collaborative process and on how to eliminate barriers to implementing the ASEAN Tourism Agreement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism.</field><field name="subject">ASEAN</field><field name="subject">Strategic alliances (Business)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40906</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dream ?? or, an unthinkable history: written in memory of women transported to Botany Bay 1787-1788</field><field name="creator">Phillip, Joan Contessa, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Written in memory of the first women convicts transported to Botany Bay, this unthinkable history, a concept posed by the historian, Paul Carter, is an experiment in extending the boundaries of academic remembering, so that the complex lives of those resilient women might be given recognition. Researching the women??s lives required an ethnographic method, or ??spatialized?? history, based on original archival research, together with research of rituals, art, literature, newspapers and music; and, importantly, the laws which circumscribed their behaviour.  A research focus was thus the administration of criminal codes and the character of prominent judges, including the significance of the Recorder of London. Theories of history based on the work of philosophers such as Heidegger, Deleuze, Guattari, Derrida, Foucault and the ethical philosopher, Wyschogrod, with her feminist perspective, have influenced narrative themes and tropes.  This experimental hybridization of historical methods and the poetics of fiction might be classified as ficto-critical historiography, where ficto-critical functions as an epithet, not a polarity, as is the case with ficto-historiography and the coinage, faction. As a meditation on the ??maybe?? of historiography, the experiment enters the debates about the relationship between history and fiction and the significance of remembering. The incompleteness of records, their silences and partialities, the forensic reading required to contextualize them, the perspective from which the narrative is told, together with the metaphorical levels of all writing, are explicitly acknowledged.  Fundamental to that acknowledgement is the narrative trope of simulacra. The narrative figures are thus copies without originals; they are an acknowledgement of the absence which haunts memories, while avoiding scepticism or relativity.  The semi-omniscient, intrusive voice of the narrator, the dialogic placement of other ??voices??, variously contrary, affirmative, informative or philosophical; together with the acknowledged artifice of narrative dramatizations in which the figures are assembled from multiple sources, are important elements in the grammar of this transgressive act of remembering with its footnotes and phantoms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1787 1788</field><field name="subject">Botany Bay</field><field name="subject">Convict women</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42743</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">802.11 positioning using signal strength fingerprinting</field><field name="creator">Salter, James William, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of location aware applications is dependent on the accuracy of the supporting positioning system.

It proposes that RENEDs significantly affect regional development. It also investigates the aspects of RENEDs that promote interorganisational collaboration on projects, and examines how RENEDs foster and manage them. The research uses a case study approach, and presents two regions suffering from the decline of their main economic source. These regions are the Hunter region of New South Wales (Australia) and the Le??n province of Castilla Y Le??n (Spain). A pilot study and a survey were conducted in both regions. Three types of analysis were applied: network, statistical and qualitative. The research method makes it possible to replicate research and develop a theory of regional networks for economic development. The results show that success of RENEDs is determined by capital investment generated by the projects, their influence in changing the economic bases of the regions, and the improvement to regional network capital. This study found that frequency of communication is a structural element that significantly affects the production of projects. However, other variables affect projects, such as external pressures from globalisation, government policies and ideologies, and internal constraints from the public, private and civic sectors. This thesis concludes that RENEDs have an important role in regional planning through the formulation of specific projects that target economic disparity. RENEDs represent a system of relationship that enrich the network capital of the regions as an important asset for their future.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional planning</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Hunter River Region</field><field name="subject">Spain</field><field name="subject">Castilla y Le??n</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20482</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction in apparent stromal cell culture density through transient fusions with osteosarcoma cells</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Minh Diem</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteosarcoma</field><field name="subject">Cancer cells</field><field name="subject">Fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Endothelium -- Cytology</field><field name="subject">Cell hybridization</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4465</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory and clinical studies on the treatment of candida-associated denture stomatitis with sodium hypochlorite or microwave irradiation</field><field name="creator">Webb, Bettine Constance</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Candida</field><field name="subject">Dentures -- Cleaning</field><field name="subject">Dentures -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Sodium hypochlorite</field><field name="subject">Stomatitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4466</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation of macrophage functions in untreated adult periodontitis</field><field name="creator">Chapple, Cheryl Christine</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Periodontitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4467</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vascular response in chronic periodontitis</field><field name="creator">Zoellner, Hans</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood-vessels -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Endothelium</field><field name="subject">Periodontitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4468</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the naturalisation and geographic distribution of the non-indigenous seed plant species of New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Gatehouse, Hazel A. W.</field><field name="description">The naturalisation and subsequent spread of non-indigenous plant species (NIPS) is a major problem for most regions of the world. Managing plant invasions requires greater understanding of factors that determine initial naturalisation and distribution of wild NIPS. By the year 2000, 2252 NIPS were recorded as wild (1773 fully naturalised and 479 casual) in New Zealand. From published literature and electronic herbaria records, I recorded year of discovery of wild populations, and regional distribution of these wild NIPS. I also recorded species related attributes hypothesised to affect naturalisation and/or distribution, including global trade, human activities, native range and biological data; and regional attributes hypothesised to affect distribution, including human population densities, land use/cover, and environmental data. I used interval-censored time-to-event analyses to estimate year of naturalisation from discovery records, then analysed the importance of historical, human activity, biogeographical and biological attributes in determining patterns of naturalisation. Typically, NIPS that naturalised earlier were herbaceous, utilitarian species that were also accidentally introduced and/or distributed, with a wide native range that included Eurasia, naturalised elsewhere, with a native congener in New Zealand. In the year 2000, 28% of wild NIPS occupied only one region, 18% occupied two regions, decreasing incrementally to 2.5 % for nine regions, but with 13.5% occupying all ten regions. I used generalised linear models (GLMs) with binomial distribution to determine predictors of whether a wild NIPS occupied ten regions or not, and GLMs with Poisson distribution for wild NIPS occupying 0 &#8211; 9 regions. As expected, the dominant effect was that species discovered earlier occupied more regions. Utilitarian wild NIPS that were also accidentally introduced and/or distributed, and wild NIPS with a native congener tended to be more widely distributed, but results for other attributes varied between datasets. Although numbers of wild NIPS recorded in regions of New Zealand were sometimes similar, composition of wild NIPS was often very different. I used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to determine dissimilarity in composition between regions. Then, after reducing correlation between predictor variables using principal components analyses (PCAs), I tested the importance of regional variables in determining the regional composition of wild NIPS using metaMDS. The density of human populations best explained the dissimilarity in composition, but temperature gradients and water availability gradients were also important. In the year 2000 more than 1100 (60%) of the 1773 fully naturalised NIPS in mainland New Zealand had each been recorded in Northland/Auckland and Canterbury, and at the other end of the scale, Southland and Westland each had fewer than 500 (30%). I used GLMs to analyse the importance of people and environment in determining the numbers of wild NIPS in each region. Because I conducted multiple tests on the same dataset I used sequential Bonferroni procedures to adjust the critical P-value. Only human population density was important in explaining the numbers of NIPS in the regions. Overall, humans were the dominant drivers in determining the patterns of naturalisation and spread, although environment helps determine the composition of NIPS in regions. Incorporating human associated factors into studies of wild NIPS helps improve the understanding of the stages in the naturalisation and spread process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invasion ecology</field><field name="subject">climate</field><field name="subject">plant naturalization</field><field name="subject">weed risk assessment</field><field name="subject">biosecurity</field><field name="subject">exotic</field><field name="subject">alien</field><field name="subject">invasive</field><field name="subject">weeds</field><field name="subject">spread</field><field name="subject">human input</field><field name="subject">introduction effort</field><field name="subject">minimum residence time</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1009</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive behaviour of Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae : a thesis presented in partial fulfi[l]ment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science (Entomology) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">He, Xiong Zhao</field><field name="description">Aphidius ervi Haliday is a cosmopolitan parasitoid species of several major aphid pests on economically important crops. Prior to this research, little information was available on its reproductive behaviour. Emergence of A. ervi peaks during the first few hours of the photophase with males being protandrous. Females become sexually mature earlier than males and oviposit primarily in the photophase. Aphids parasitised in their early instars die before reproduction but those parasitised in later instars produce a limited number of progeny. Females prefer aphids of 3- to 5-d-old over the younger and older aphids for oviposition. Females ovipositing in 4- to 7-d-old aphids have more fitness gains in terms of progeny body size and egg load at emergence. Fertilised eggs are more likely deposited in large hosts and unfertilised eggs in small ones. Large individuals have greater longevity, large males father more progeny, and large females have higher fecundity, parasitism and greater ability in host searching. However, with increasing body size females gain more than males in longevity and fecundity but males gain more than females in the number of female progeny. Males can inseminate up to nine females and they carry about 82% effective sperm at emergence and replenish about 18% sperm during their adult life. Females adjust the oviposition and sex allocation strategies in response to increasing host density with higher number of aphids parasitised at higher host densities and lower proportion of female progeny produced at lower host densities. Males play an active role in mating behaviour. Males having mating experience, and being large or younger, respond to females more quickly and perform better courtships resulting in higher mating success. Males prefer larger and younger females for mating probably because the latter have greater reproductive potential. Males optimize the use of their sperm based on the availability of their sperm and the reproductive status (age) of females. The switchingoff of female receptivity of male mating attempt after the mating is a gradual process. Some females accept the second males within 1 minute since the termination of the first mating. The shorter mating period in the second mating suggests that females remate probably due to the gradual process of switching-off of female receptivity rather than the insufficient sperm transformation during the first mating. Males prolong their mating duration in male-biased operational sex ratio to reduce the probability of female remating.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aphids</field><field name="subject">Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/749</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive measurement of stress and pain in cattle using infrared thermography : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Mairi</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to validate the use of infrared thermography (IRT) to non-invasively measure stress and/or pain in cattle. The main approach was to measure changes in heat emitted from superficial capillaries around the eye (referred to as eye temperature) in response to various aversive husbandry procedures used routinely on farms. In addition, various exogenous challenges were given to investigate the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in regulating the eye temperature response. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that an increase in eye temperature was due to HPA activity in cattle. A rapid drop in eye temperature occurred immediately after disbudding, an electric prod, startling and shouting. It is suggested that this was caused by the redirection of blood from the capillary beds via sympathetically-mediated vasoconstriction. Therefore, the role of the ANS was tested by measuring eye temperature, heart rate variability (HRV) and plasma catecholamine responses simultaneously. Somatic pain from disbudding and initial responses to surgical castration included a synchronised drop in eye temperature, increases in catecholamines and changes in HRV indicative of increased sympathetic activity. The role of the sympathetic nervous system was further confirmed by a drop in eye temperature that occurred following an epinephrine challenge. In contrast, deeper visceral pain from castration caused a more marked increase in eye temperature and changes in HRV indicative of increased parasympathetic tone. The underlying mechanism driving the increase in eye temperature is unknown; however, it is possible that it may be caused by vasodilation due to increased parasympathetic activity. These differences in ANS responses to different procedures, detected by IRT and HRV, may be due to the nature of the pain and the relative fear associated with the procedure. In summary, this research showed that during stress or pain, the heat emitted from superficial capillaries around the eye changes as blood flow is regulated under ANS control and these changes can be quantified using IRT. A combination of IRT and HRV is a non-invasive way to measure ANS activity and assess acute welfare impacts of husbandry practices in cattle. Further research using pharmacological inhibition and stimulation of the ANS activity would be beneficial to fully understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms of the eye temperature and HRV responses in cattle and other species during stress and/or pain. The full capability of IRT and HRV for detection of disease and emotional states and the effects of different intensities of pain, individual traits and previous experience also deserve attention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cattle</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Eye temperature</field><field name="subject">Infrared thermography</field><field name="subject">Heart rate variability</field><field name="subject">Plasma catecholamine responses</field><field name="subject">Autonomic nervous system</field><field name="subject">HPA axis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300509 Radiology and imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/750</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional supervision practice under new public management : a study of the perspectives of probation officers and service managers in the community probation service : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Social Policy and Social Work, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">O'Donoghue, Kieran Barry</field><field name="description">This thesis examines professional supervision practice under new public management from the perspectives of probation officers and service managers in the Community Probation Service. In particular, the research explores the participants&#8217; philosophy of professional supervision, their recent supervision experiences, and their aspirations and expectations with regard to professional supervision. In order to provide a background for an informed analysis and discussion of the research findings, the thesis discusses the key themes in the social service supervision and new public management literature. It also examines the Community Probation Service&#8217;s context and the history of new public management and professional supervision in this organisation. The thesis is a qualitative study that is informed by social work practice theory and utilises the phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches. The research findings show that amongst the participants there was: (a) an unclear philosophy of supervision; (b) minimal recent experience of supervision and little ownership or support for the agency supervision project; (c) a belief that the context increased their need for supervision, but at the same time reduced their ability to receive or participate in it; (d) an expectation that professional supervision would assist them to work more effectively with clients and staff; (e) an expectation of good committed supervisors who would support and help them develop; and (f) an expectation that the agency would support professional supervision through resourcing, guidelines, accredited supervisors and the establishment of a learning culture. The major implications of these findings are that: (1) there is a need for staff to be socialised into professional social service supervision; (2) that the professional supervision programme within the Community Probation Service, as currently implemented, is unlikely to be successful; and (3) that professional social service supervision needs to be focused upon persons and their environments, rather than upon the agency.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Probation officers</field><field name="subject">Professional supervision</field><field name="subject">Social service supervision</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390400 Law Enforcement::390405 Correctional theory and services; penology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/751</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics and numerics of generalised Euler equations : a thesis submitted to Massey University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Ph.D. in Mathematics, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xingyou</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the well-posedness, dynamical properties and numerical treatment of the generalised Euler equations on the Bott-Virasoro group with respect to the general H[superscript]k metric , k[is greater than or equal to]2. The term &#8220;generalised Euler equations&#8221; is used to describe geodesic equations on Lie groups, which unifies many differential equations and has found many applications in such as hydrodynamics, medical imaging in the computational anatomy, and many other fields. The generalised Euler equations on the Bott-Virasoro group for k = 0, 1 are well-known and intensively studied&#8212; the Korteweg-de Vries equation for k = 0 and the Camassa-Holm equation for k = 1. Unlike these, the equations for k[is greater than or equal to]2, which we call the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation, is not known to be integrable. This distinction motivates the study of the mCH equation. In this thesis, we derive the mCH equation and establish the short time existence of solutions, the well-posedness of the mCH equation, long time existence, the existence of the weak solutions, both on the circle S and [blackboard bold] R, and three conservation laws, show some quite interesting properties, for example, they do not lead to the blowup in finite time, unlike the Camassa-Holm equation. We then consider two numerical methods for the modified Camassa-Holm equation: the particle method and the box scheme. We prove the convergence result of the particle method. The numerical simulations indicate another interesting phenomenon: although mCH does not admit blowup in finite time, it admits solutions that blow up (which means their maximum value becomes infinity) at infinite time, which we call weak blowup. We study this novel phenomenon using the method of matched asymptotic expansion. A whole family of self-consistent blowup profiles is obtained. We propose a mechanism by which the actual profile is selected that is consistent with the simulations, but the mechanism is only partly supported by the analysis. We study the four particle systems for the mCH equation finding numerical evidence both for the non-integrability of the mCH equations and for the existence of the fourth integral. We also study the higher dimensional case and obtain the short time existence and well-posedness for the generalised Euler equation in the two dimension case.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geodesic equations on Lie groups</field><field name="subject">Differential equations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/748</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution design for complex value databases : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ma, Hui</field><field name="description">Distribution design for databases usually addresses the problems of fragmentation, allocation and replication. However, the main purposes of distribution are to improve performance and to increase system reliability. The former aspect is particularly relevant in cases where the desire to distribute data originates from the distributed nature of an organization with many data needs only arising locally, i.e., some data are retrieved and processed at only one or at most very few locations. Therefore, query optimization should be treated as an intrinsic part of distribution design. Due to the interdependencies between fragmentation, allocation and distributed query optimization it is not efficient to study each of the problems in isolation to get overall optimal distribution design. However, the combined problem of fragmentation, allocation and distributed query optimization is NP-hard, and thus requires heuristics to generate efficient solutions. In this thesis the foundations of fragmentation and allocation in databases on query processing are investigated using a query cost model. The considered databases are defined on complex value data models, which capture complex value, object-oriented and XML-based databases. The emphasis on complex value databases enables a large variety of schema fragmentation, while at the same time it imposes restrictions on the way schemata can be fragmented. It is shown that the allocation of locations to the nodes of an optimized query tree is only marginally affected by the allocation of fragments. This implies that optimization of query processing and optimization of fragment allocation are largely orthogonal to each other, leading to several scenarios for fragment allocation. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that optimized queries are given with subqueries having selection and projection operations applied to leaves. With this assumption some heuristic procedures can be developed to find an &#8220;optimal&#8221; fragmentation and allocation. In particular, cost-based algorithms for primary horizontal and derived horizontal fragmentation, vertical fragmentation are presented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distributed databases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280103 Information storage, retrieval and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/747</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cyclo- and polyphosphazenes containing 2-oxypyridine moieties coordinated to selected transition metals : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Kirk, Stephen</field><field name="description">The phosphazene ligands spiro(biph)tetrakis(2-oxypyridine)cyclotriphosphazene (L1), spiro(biph)tetrakis(4-methyl-2-oxypyridine)cyclotriphosphazene (L2), and spiro(biph)tetrakis(6-methyl-2-oxypyridine)cyclotriphosphazene (L3 In solution, [CuL) have been synthesised and characterised as small molecule templates for the polymeric analogues. Complexes of each ligand with selected transition metals have been synthesised and characterised. Where X-ray crystal structures have been obtained, the predominant geometry is a five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal (TBP) form, though variations exist. 2Cl2] retains the TBP form whereas [CoL2Cl2 ] rearranges to a tetrahedral geometry. In order to elucidate this behaviour, diamagnetic complexes were synthesised and variable temperature NMR (VTNMR) studies conducted. The complexes [ZnL2Cl2], [CdL2Cl2] and [HgL2Cl2] exhibit fluxional behaviour as monitored by VTNMR studies. The X-ray structure of [CdL2Cl2] contains three molecules in the unit cell that demonstrate what is thought to be the first evidence for a fluxional mechanism in phosphazene compounds. The complex [ZnL2Cl2 ] exists at low temperature as discernable major and minor species. Polyphosphazene analogues have been synthesised and complexed with selected transition metals. The polymer complexes display variations in solubility and stability which is postulated to be due to the ratio of side group substitution, position of the pyridyl methyl group and the nature of the complexing metal. A number of the polymers degrade prior to workup, possibly as a result of base-promoted attack on the backbone by the pyridyl nitrogen atoms. Electronic spectra reveal that where soluble, the Co(II) polymer complexes have a tetrahedral geometry, whereas the Cu(II) polymer complexes distort between TBP and square-based pyramidal dependent on the ratio of metal used.

In this study, an investigation has been made into a novel strategy to control some common foodborne pathogens, and therefore, to provide an alternative means for enhancing the safety and extending the shelf lives of food products. Modified atmosphere is able to extend the shelf life of seafood and meat products. In this study, a simulated controlled atmosphere (CA) broth system was used to investigate the potential of a modified atmosphere rich in CO2 at a concentration of 40%, supplemented with N2, to control common foodborne pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Controlled atmosphere significantly reduced the exponential growth rates of all tested pathogens, while the effects on other growth parameters (eg. lag phase duration and maximum population density) depended on the individual species and the specific growth conditions. The CA significantly extended the lag phase durations of S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus at 20 degrees C at both pH 6.3 and 6.8, and that of L. monocytogenes at both 7 degrees C and 20 degrees C, and at both pH 6.3 and 6.8. The CA also significantly lowered the maximum population densities of S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus at 20 degrees C, at pH 6.3 and 6.8, S. Typhimurium at pH 6.8, and L. monocytogenes at pH 6.3 and 7 degrees C. E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium were more resistant to the inhibitory effect of the CA, while S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus were most sensitive. The inhibitory effect of CA was due mainly to the extensions of the lag phase duration and the reduction of the exponential growth rates of the test pathogens. This study confirms other studies that CA as a means for food preservation provides potential to control foodborne pathogens and therefore enhance the safety of a food product. The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in controlling spoilage microorganisms and pathogens in foods has been a popular research theme worldwide. In this study, the antimicrobial effects of 18 lactic acid bacteria strains were evaluated in vitro, with emphasis on the most effective strain, the newly characterised Lactobacillus reuteri DPC16. The results demonstrated antagonistic effects of many strains against L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium and S. aureus. L. reuteri DPC16 showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogens including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Co-cultivation of L. reuteri DPC16, and co-incubation of its spent culture supernatant (DPC16-SCS), with the pathogens have demonstrated that the antimicrobial effect is bactericidal and valid at pH 4 - 6.5 and at a temperature as low as 10 degrees C. Further characterisation of the antimicrobial effect of L. reuteri DPC16 showed it to be mainly due to the presence of reuterin (&#223;-hydroxypropionaldehyde), although lactic acid may have also played a role. These characteristics of L. reuteri DPC16 and its metabolite reuterin make it an unique and potent candidate as a biopreservative to control both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in foods. The combination of L. reuteri DPC16 and CA was assessed for its inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes using DPC16-SCS and the fermentative supernatant of L. reuteri DPC16 from a glycerol-water solution (DPC16-GFS). The results showed that both of these supernatants, at 25 AU/mL, in combination with CA (60% CO2:40% N2) had a combined inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes which could not be achieved by any one of the individual factors alone. Analysis of the levels of expression of some stress response genes of L. monocytogenes, after growth in the presence of L. reuteri DPC16 supernatant and/or CA, showed that the expression of some genes was affected including genes betL, gbuA and opuCA responsible for osmosis adaptation and genes gadA, gadB and gadC responsible for acid tolerance. Induction of gbuA, gadB and gadC by the culture supernatant suggests activation of osmotic and acid adaptation and that these genes play a major role in the culture supernatant-induced stresses. An investigation was also carried out to determine if the changes in gene expression conferred a cross-protection to heat. The result showed that the survival of L. monocytogenes grown in the presence of the culture supernatant and CA was significantly increased after exposure to heat treatment at 56oC, suggesting that a cross-protection to thermal stress had been induced. Based on these findings it is proposed that a comprehensive novel strategy incorporating both L. reuteri DPC16 or its fermentative products and a modified atmosphere rich in CO2 could be developed to potentially control foodborne pathogens in food products.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lactobacillus reuteri DPC16</field><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="subject">Protective atmospheres</field><field name="subject">Food preservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/746</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of institutional factors on disclosure level of director and executive remuneration in Australia</field><field name="creator">Riaz, Zahid, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the role of three institutional factors (regulative; normative and cultural-cognitive pillars of institutions) in addressing agency problems of Australia. In the wake of the series of corporate collapses of current decade, director and executive remuneration was identified as one of the major causes behind these scandals. The Australian government and other related organisations made both regulative and non-regulative institutional reforms to manage this agency conflict. These reforms, encapsulated in Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP) Act 2004 demanded an increased level of disclosure of director and executive remuneration particularly, the disclosure of performance based salary. Subsequently, these amendments provided an opportunity through a non-binding vote to shareholders to participate in executive remuneration decisions.  This study proposes a new synthesis of institutional and agency theories by examining how institutional interventions addresses agency conflicts in the Australian context. A conceptual model is developed to measure both the conjoined and distinctive institutional impact on the disclosure level of director and executive remuneration in Australia. To measure and quantify the aforementioned impact a mixed method research strategy was used. First, content analysis as an investigative tool was used to develop a disclosure index which determined the level of disclosure of director and executive remuneration from top 100 Australian listed entities. Second, a conceptual model, positing the relationships between independent and dependent variables was verified through an econometric analysis of collected data, performed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15.  The findings of this research reveal that there exists a significant difference between the levels of disclosure in the pre and post stages of the introduction of the CLERP Act 2004. This result highlights the significance of regulatory intervention in addressing agency conflicts. The study also indicates that regulative and normative pillars have a higher impact than the culture-cognitive pillar on disclosure practices of Australian firms. In light of these results, the new blend between agency and institutional theories highlight the role of different institutions, particularly the government, in stabilising the organisational practices for good governance and creating national competitive advantages.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disclosure of executive remuneration.</field><field name="subject">Agency conflicts.</field><field name="subject">Institutional theory.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43581</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B-related liver disease burden in Vietnam and Australia</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van Thi Thuy, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) and estimates HBV-related liver disease burden in Vietnam and Australia using a cross-sectional study design and mathematical modelling.  A population-based seroprevalence survey was undertaken in rural Northern Vietnam. In a sample of 870 study participants, prevalence of anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) was 68.2% and 19.0%, respectively, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was detected in 16.4% of the HBsAg-positive group. Factors associated with HBV infection (anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive) were age 60 years or older (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.82; 95% CI, 1.35??10.80; P = 0.01), residence in Vu Thu district (AOR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.16??4.17; P &lt;0.001), hospital admission (AOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.33??4.13; P = 0.003) and history of acupuncture (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.29??3.13; P = 0.002). Household contact with a person with liver disease (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.29??3.52; P = 0.003), reuse of syringes (AOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.25??2.62; P = 0.002) and sharing of razors (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03??2.79; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of HBsAg positivity. Alanine  aminotransferase (ALT) level was elevated (&gt;40 IU/L) in 43% of the HBsAg-positive group; the proportion of elevated ALT was higher in HBeAg-positive (65%) compared with HBeAg-negative (39%) (P = 0.02).  Based on data from the seroprevalence study, other prevalence estimates and HBV natural history parameters, a mathematical model was used to estimate HBV-related liver disease burden in Vietnam. Estimated chronic HBV prevalence increased from 6.4 million cases in 1990 to around 8.4 million cases in 2005 and was projected to decrease to 8.0 million by 2025. Estimated HBV-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence increased linearly from 21 900 and 9400 in 1990 to 58 650 and 25 000 in 2025. Estimated HBV-related mortality increased from 12 600 in 1990 to 40 000 in 2025. To estimate HBV-related HCC incidence among Australians born in the Asia-Pacific region (APR), a mathematical modelling was developed utilising HBV natural history parameters, HBV prevalence estimates in APR countries and immigration data. Chronic HBV cases among the APR-born population increased rapidly from the late 1970s, reaching a peak of 4182 in 1990. Chronic HBV prevalence increased to more than 53 000 in 2005. Estimates of HBV-related HCC increased linearly from one in 1960 to 140 in 2005, with a projected increase to 250 in 2025. Universal HBV vaccination programs in countries of origin had limited impact on projected HBV-related HCC to 2025.  HBV-related HCC survival was analysed in a population-based linkage study in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Between 1994 and 2002, 278 HCC cases notified to the NSW Cancer Registry were linked to chronic HBV infection notifications to the NSW Health Department. The majority of cases were male (83.5%) and overseas born (93.6%); Asian-born cases accounted for 72.1%. Median survival following HCC diagnosis was 15 months. HCC survival was poorer among older age groups (P &lt;0.001), and among cases with regional spread (HR 3.23; 95% CI, 1.83??5.69; P &lt;0.001) and distant metastases (HR 3.85; 95% CI, 2.44??6.08; P &lt;0.001). Sex, region of birth, and study period (1994??1997 versus 1998??2002) were not associated with HCC survival.  The results of these studies show that HBV infection remains a major public health challenge in highly endemic countries such as Vietnam. HBV-related liver disease burden in Vietnam was estimated to increase for at least two decades despite the introduction of a universal infant HBV-vaccination program. Similarly, HBV-related HCC among Australians born in the APR was estimated to continue to increase over the next two decades. Survival for HBV-related HCC even in settings such as Australia continues to be extremely poor. Strategies are required to expand HBV treatment to individuals with chronic HBV infection who are at greatest risk of progression to advanced liver disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Liver disease burden</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42118</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of using least squares adjustment to upgrade spatial data in GIS</field><field name="creator">Merritt, Roger, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The GIS Industry has digitised cadastre from the best available paper maps over the last few decades, incorporating the inherent errors in those paper maps and in the digitising process.

New therapies are needed as many patients with dry eye and PED continue to suffer despite maximal standard therapy, and while efficacious autologous serum therapy is not routinely available. Like serum, TOSM contains tear components and was expected to have some of the physiological effects of tears. Clinical and in vitro studies were used to evaluate two similar formulations of TOSM. To comply with local pharmacy manufacturing policies, components were omitted from TOSM v1 to produce TOSM v2. In pilot studies, conducted over 1 month, TOSM v1 improved dry eye signs and symptoms and healed over a quarter of PED. In a 2 month randomised double-masked trial, TOSM v2 improved the signs and symptoms of dry eye but was not superior to saline (placebo). No serious or irreversible side-effects occurred. The altered composition of TOSM v2 may have reduced its efficacy. However, a significant improvement in blepharitis (eyelid margin disease) and conjunctival impression cytology (an objective measure of ocular surface health) was found with TOSM v2. Improvement in blepharitis is an encouraging finding as it has not been reported in other dry eye trials. It was hypothesised that TOSM would benefit ocular surface disorders by improving ocular surface health. In vitro, primary and cell line human corneal epithelial cells were supported by TOSM v1 and TOSM v2. Outgrowth from limbal explants and corneal reepithelialisation following wounding occurred with TOSM v2. This and the impression cytology findings support our hypothesis. Further, ocular surface damage with dry eye and PED may activate the corneal wound healing response. For wound healing, compared to human serum, TOSM v1 and TOSM v2 had beneficial effects in vitro on epithelial cells and human corneal fibroblasts. This may translate into a reduction in potentially vision-threatening corneal scarring in vivo with TOSM. However, ocular surface disorders are a heterogenous group and wound healing is a complex process such that different preparations of TOSM may be needed for use in different disorders and at different stages of the disease process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Therapeutics, Ophthalmological</field><field name="subject">Eye - Diseases</field><field name="subject">Ocular Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24283</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being and becoming : ritual and reproduction in an island Melanesian society</field><field name="creator">Fergie, Deane Joanne.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 359-381.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ANU</field><field name="subject">Rites and ceremonies Papua New Guinea Tabar Islands</field><field name="subject">Ethnology Papua New Guinea Tabar Islands</field><field name="subject">Tabar Islands (Papua New Guinea) Social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phf351.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6927833</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hindustani vocal music : a case study of oral transmission</field><field name="creator">Alter, Andrew Burton.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 277-281.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Hindustani music</field><field name="subject">Vocal music India</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09MUM/09muma466.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6927890</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lives unremembered : the Holocaust and strategies of its representation : an exegesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rajala, Tero Markus</field><field name="description">The Holocaust is a subject that seems to defy artistic representation by way of its sheer scale of tragedy and subsequent trauma. As I will demonstrate in this paper, it is hard to restore visibility &#8211; pictorial links between past and present realities &#8211; to crimes that have been deliberately submerged by its perpetrators. I will examine some of the common strategies used in representation of the victims of the Holocaust since the end of the Second World War, in the mediums of film and photography. As my main method of enquiry, I will examine three films from different eras, and of very different approaches in terms of their processing of the proposed original evidence, as examples to illustrate my arguments. In the second chapter Alain Resnais's documentary film Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog) is analyzed as a birthplace of the so-called iconography of the Holocaust. Chapter three examines workings of memory through the aesthetic form that was soon to follow; the role and testimony of the survivors is considered through Claude Lanzmann's Shoah. In the fourth chapter a new player is introduced: the second generation witness of postmemory, works of transmitted but unexperienced realities. In this chapter I will closer examine the workings of art in the game of reprocessing the evidence of the Holocaust, and through Dariusz Jablonski's film Fotoamator I aim to critique how the previously discussed approaches serve to further lock the Holocaust in an inaccessible canon. Moreover, the generalization implied &#8211; a drive toward universalization of the Holocaust as an idiom or even a metaphor for the dark sides of human history/character &#8211; derives from problems of representation; mainly that of anonymity in face of the proposed beauty of the spectacle, of tragedy and suffering in mass-media. A key problem is that any historical document, however we define one, is considered transparent and unmediated, whereas art is clearly something where a degree of mediation is necessarily recognized. In the face of this dichotomy it seems that all the collected "proof" of the Holocaust &#8211; witness accounts" photographs" films" material remains &#8211; achieves, is to stregthen the prevailing version of history.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Holocaust</field><field name="subject">Film</field><field name="subject">Nuit et Brouillard</field><field name="subject">Night and Fog</field><field name="subject">Shoah</field><field name="subject">Fotoamator</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410301 Film and video studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/756</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's forgotten warriors : 3NZ division in the South Pacific in World War II : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Newell, Reginald Hedley</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the origins, deployment, operations and demise of 3NZ Division. It argues that the forces that became the Division were sent to Fiji because of a perceived strategic threat, particularly from airpower, if the islands were seized by the Japanese. The Division was relieved in Fiji by the Americans but returned to the Pacific in 1943 because New Zealand wanted to earn a place at the peace table and the Americans lacked troops in the theatre. Whether the Division was primarily an offensive or garrison unit remained unclear throughout its existence and influenced its constitution. Major General Harold Barrowclough, its commander from 1942 to 1944, had somewhat different strengths from his fellow divisional commander Major General Bernard Freyberg, and operated in a very different environment, with amphibious operations at brigade level. Furthermore, his division operated in an area dominated by the United States Navy rather than the more familiar culture of the British Army. More generally, the relationship between the New Zealanders and the Americans in the South Pacific was complex, generally symbiotic but occasionally unfriendly and even lethal. The perception in New Zealand that service in the South Pacific was less onerous than service in the Mediterranean ignores the often unpleasant and even deadly conditions faced by the soldiers of 3NZ Division. The Division&#8217;s combat operations contributed significantly to the neutralisation of the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul. Except for a brief period in 1942, 3NZ Division took second place in New Zealand&#8217;s war effort to 2NZ Division. This reflected Wellington&#8217;s general inclination to favour Commonwealth over local defence, and, despite some wavering, New Zealand declined to follow Australia and focus its efforts in the Pacific. Lack of manpower to field two divisions resulted in 3NZ Division having only two brigades and growing demands from the Air Force, industry and agriculture ultimately led to its disbandment. Thereafter it faded from the public consciousness and its contribution disregarded. The men and women of 3NZ Division have undeservedly become New Zealand's forgotten warriors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">Army</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">World War II</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430103 History: Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/753</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Repetition to the life" : liminality, subjectivity, and speech acts in Shakespearean late romance : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in English at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hall, Mark Webster</field><field name="description">One key debate in the critical reception of Shakespearean late romance concerns how best to approach the functionality of the dramatised worlds that constitute it. What I call &#8216;containment&#8217; readings of late romance argue that the alternative realities explored in the plays &#8211; realities of miraculous revivals, pastoral escapes and divine interventions, &#8211; serve to affirm the inevitable return of extant power structures. Utopian readings dispute this, making the case that the political and existential destructurations exposed in these plays point toward a new orientation for the dramatic subjects they produce. With the aim of contributing to the debate between containment and utopian readings, I explore in this thesis how late romance produces its subjects. I interrogate the plays&#8217; structures with the help of the anthropological model of the limen, which is shown to be a useful category through which to educe the meaningfulness of certain ritual sequences. The limen&#8217;s three phases &#8211; separation; limen; aggregation &#8211; are employed to make sense of the transitions that subjects undergo in the four plays studied: Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter&#8217;s Tale, and The Tempest. To study the liminality of these plays is, I argue, to study how dramatic subjects are produced therein, guided by the fact that their language shares properties with ritual discourse. When studying this discourse the focus falls on that class of language which impinges most lastingly on subjects: performatives. How performatives function in late romance will show us how real the changes induced in liminal subjects are. I examine the four plays in turn and find that their performative language produces subjects in a limen-consistent fashion. Aristocratic subjects are first of all estranged from those discursive practices that nourish their identity; their subjectivities are then glued back together in the ritualised, emblematising language of the limen. The conclusion I draw from my interrogation of the liminal patterns uncovered is that the functionality of late romance is broadly consistent with containment readings; I claim to have extended such readings, however, in showing that Shakespeare&#8217;s dramatisation of the state&#8217;s return to power usefully exposes its logic and symbolic grammar.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shakespeare</field><field name="subject">Late Romance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420204 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/754</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The expression of values in the context of non-governmental development organisations : a case-study of Oxfam New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy (Development Studies) at Massey University (Palmerston North)</field><field name="creator">Hine, Susan Douglas</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploratory study of the &#8216;expression of values&#8217; within development organisations. I consider the value-bases of the economic and humanist paradigms of development, the nature of values and their relation to both organisational and personal positions, and how these impact on non-governmental development organisations (NGDOs). The expression of development values is embedded in theory, in practice modalities, in organisational structure and function, and in personal beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. Development values are also inherent in statements of an organisation&#8217;s vision and mission. More often than not these values are implicit, and do not always match with the organisation&#8217;s operations. In the course of this exploration I draw on the broad history of development paradigms, the influences of moral philosophy, and the evolution of NGDOs. I acknowledge the complexity of &#8216;development&#8217;, evident in the multiplicity of players and the multi-disciplinary nature of development in practice. A case-study of Oxfam New Zealand illustrates the significance of values and their relevance to operational functioning. My research methodology involved open-ended questionnaire techniques and analysis of secondary resources drawn from Oxfam publications. Analysis of findings reveals an interdependence between words and their meanings and the interpretation of both organisational and personal values. When the results of the case-study are aligned with the literature, my conclusions make a case for stronger articulation of values as an important future role and function of NGDOs, including Oxfam New Zealand. Values represent the why of development that shapes the how of development practice, and thus explicit values can enhance organisational strength and power.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxfam New Zealand</field><field name="subject">NGDOs</field><field name="subject">Development organisations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/752</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for genetic factors influencing immune responses to a killed Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis vaccine in Australian fine-wool merino sheep : thesis in fulfilment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science, Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, College of Sciences, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Dukkipati, Venkata Sayoji Rao</field><field name="description">VSR Dukkipati (2007). A search for genetic factors influencing immune responses to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Doctoral thesis, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. A study was conducted to identify associations between genetic markers and immune responses in Australian fine-wool Merino sheep to a killed Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) vaccine (GudairTM). Blood samples and immune response data (antibody and interferon gamma, IFN-gamma results) were obtained from 934 sheep from a longterm Map vaccination trial undertaken on three independent properties in New South Wales, Australia. Blood samples were genotyped for eight microsatellite markers that included four (DYMS1, OLADRW, OLADRB and SMHCC1) from the Ovar-Mhc region, two each from the SLC11A1 (OVINRA1 and OVINRA2) and IFN-gamma (o(IFN)gamma and OarKP6) gene regions. Vaccination with GudairTM induced strong antibody and IFN-gamma responses as early as two weeks post-vaccination. Between-property differences in magnitude and trend of immune responses, concomitant with season of vaccination and magnitude of natural infection prevalent in individual flocks, were evident. Immune responses in controls on all the three properties remained consistently low, except for slightly elevated IFN-gamma levels at a few time points in controls of properties 2 and 3, concomitant with exposure to natural infection. There were only 2 alleles and 3 genotypes for marker o(IFN)gamma but other loci exhibited extensive polymorphisms, the most occurring at OLADRW which had 42 alleles and 137 genotypes. Heterozygosities varied between 33% (OVINRA2) and 87% (SMHCC1), while polymorphic information contents ranged from 0.31 (o(IFN)gamma) to 0.88 (OLADRW). Genotypes at loci DYMS1, OLADRB, SMHCC1, OVINRA1 and o(IFN)gamma were in Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), while those at OarKP6 were in HWE only when rare alleles (&lt;1.0% frequency) were pooled with the closest size class. Departure from HWE, resulting from possible preferential amplification of alleles in heterozygotes, was evident at OLADRW and OVINRA2. Associations between immune responses and genetic polymorphisms at the marker loci were examined by analysing both genotypic and allelic affects. The study revealed several genotypes/alleles at different marker loci to be significantly associated with antibody and IFN-gamma responses to vaccination with GudairTM. However, the majority of those effects were inconsistent across the three properties. Based on significance and consistency in effects across the three properties, five genotypes (two at DYMS1 and one each at OLADRB, SMHCC1 and OVINRA1) and three alleles (one each at DYMS1, OLADRB and o(IFN)gamma) were considered either &#8216;probable&#8217; or &#8216;most likely&#8217; to be associated with low IFN-gamma responses, while a genotype at o(IFN)gamma was considered &#8216;most likely&#8217; to influence high IFN-gamma responses. An allele at OarKP6 was considered &#8216;probable&#8217; to be associated with low antibody responses to vaccination. Considering the significance of IFN-gamma responses in protection against Map, it is likely that the identified genotype/alleles influencing IFN-gamma responses to vaccination would also influence immune responses to natural Map infections. However, further studies need to be conducted to determine the role of these marker genotypes/alleles in protection against paratuberculosis under natural infection conditions.

The Quaternary record of Chatham Island comprises mainly deposits from terrestrial environments, predominantly thick blanket peats and aeolian sand, all of which range from latest Castlecliffian to Haweran/Recent in age. Quaternary deposits that demonstratably predate this age range (i.e. &gt; Oxygen Isotope Stage 12) have not been recognised anywhere on the Island. Their absence is, at this stage, attributed to a major marine transgression across much of the northern and central portions of the Island during Oxygen Isotope Stage 11. Two rhyolitic tephra produced during two of the largest eruptions from the Taupo Volcanic Zone are present on Chatham Island. The 27.1 ka Kawakawa Tephra is well preserved across most of the Island, occurring within most pre-Holocene sequences. The 345 ka Rangitawa Tephra, not previously recognised on Chatham Island, is found in a few scattered coastal locations where older, late Castlecliffian sediments are preserved. In the absence of any other forms of radiometric age control these two tephras have provided the principal means for time control within and between stratigraphic sequences on the Island. Palynology has been used predominantly to determine climatic conditions at the time of sediment accumulation. Palynological investigations of seven sections of peat deposits have also demonstrated that cyclic changes in vegetation patterns have occurred throughout the Quaternary on Chatham Island. However these changes have not been as significant as those that occurred on mainland New Zealand over the Quaternary. It is concluded that this indicates climatic deterioration during glacials may not have been as pronounced on Chatham Island as on the mainland. Marine terraces created during former high sea level stands are preserved in several areas on Chatham Island. Quaternary terrace surfaces ranging in age from Last Interglacial (OIS 5e) to OIS 11 occur at heights of 3-5 m, 9 &#8211; 10 m, 16 m, 20 m and 30 - 40 m above sea level. An exhumed surface of Late Pliocene age occurs at 7 &#8211; 14 m a.s.l.. Terrace ages have been determined using cover-bed stratigraphy, and in particular the presence or absence of tephra marker beds. Height-age relationships of marine terraces have been used to develop preliminary rates of tectonic uplift on Chatham Island. The resulting values range between 0.01 &#8211; 0.13 mm/yr and are very low compared with more tectonically active areas of mainland New Zealand. However, there is considerable variation in these rates across Chatham Island, indicating that the tectonic history of the Island over the Quaternary may be complex. This thesis has also demonstrated that considerably more work is required to fully understand the Quaternary history of Chatham Island. In particular, better numerical age control on key deposits; more detailed, high-resolution pollen records from key locations; and obtaining stratigraphic records from a greater range of locations. This is particularly so for the southern uplands where older records are virtually inaccessible due to a thick blanketing of post-glacial peat deposits.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quaternary geology</field><field name="subject">Chatham Islands</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/757</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameter estimation using a genetic algorithm for complex catchment modelling systems.</field><field name="creator">Fang, Tianjun, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Implementation of physically distributed catchment modelling systems reshapes the fundamental philosophy of traditional calibration approaches by supporting the concept of equifinality. Arising from the concept of equifinality, alternative behavioural parameter sets within a given catchment modelling system structure can generate similar levels of simulation performance. This concept is motivated by the existence of a variety of uncertainties associated with a complex catchment modelling system, such as an imperfect model structure, measurement errors in both the input data and the recorded flows, and unknown, or poorly defined, interactions among parameters. However, the difficulty of searching for behavioural parameter sets increases as the complexity of the catchment modelling systems increases.  This study undertook an investigation on the feasibility and robustness of a real-value coding genetic algorithm (GA) for calibrating the physically distributed Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) using the Centennial Park catchment in Sydney as a case study. It was found that a real-value coding GA was a robust technique suitable to search for behavioural parameter sets and, in particular, it was found that this approach was capable of identifying the promising range of values for spatially variable parameters.  Moreover, the widespread use of physically distributed catchment modelling systems has highlighted the importance of estimating the uncertainty in the parameter values and in the predictions obtained from a complex catchment modelling system as well as in catchment averaged, or lumped, systems that have been the focus of many previous studies. Bayesian inference has been shown to be a tool suitable for parameter uncertainty estimation in catchment modelling. However, the application of Bayesian inference faces difficulties in complex high-dimensional systems where there is little if any a priori knowledge about the proposal distribution of the parameters.  In this study, a real-value coding GA was used to undertake uncertainty estimation on spatially variable control parameters with little a priori knowledge about the proposal distribution of parameters. After 50,000 evaluations, the marginal posterior distributions of spatially variable parameters which are associated with behavioural parameter sets were identified. The performance of a behavioural parameter set under a range of hydrological conditions was evaluated. Updating of the marginal distributions of these control parameters was implemented by adding additional calibration data.  Interactions among the spatially variable control parameters were investigated also. Results based on the Pearson Correlation method indicate no clear relationship between any two control parameters. However, a methodology to detect relationships among groups of parameters was developed. Application of this methodology suggests that the simulation performance of SWMM was influenced by combinations of parameter values rather than values of the individual parameters.  Finally, the predictive uncertainty associated with the existence of behavioural parameter sets was considered. A number of alternative strategies were used to evaluate the predictive performance. Consideration of the results suggests that use of a small number of parameter sets randomly selected from the large number of behavioural parameter sets was the best strategy in terms of efficiently obtaining predictive performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms.</field><field name="subject">Water -- Distribution -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Water quality -- Management -- New South Wales -- Centennial Park.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40740</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quasiparticle dynamics in a single cooper-pair transistor.</field><field name="creator">Court, Nadia A., Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of single Cooper-pair transistor (SCPT) for fast and sensitive detection of quasiparticle dynamics. This investigation is motivated by the possibility of quantum information processing using superconducting nanoscale circuits, such as the SCPT and the Cooper-pair-box (CPB). In the SCPT coherent charge transport can be temporarily halted due to quasiparticle tunnelling, known as quasiparticle poisoning. Quasiparticle poisoning can be reduced by the use of engineered island and lead gap energies. The thesis begins by reporting measurements of the superconducting gap in aluminium - aluminium-oxide - aluminium tunnel junctions, as a function of film thickness. We have observed an increase in the superconducting energy gap of aluminium with decreasing film thickness. This method is used to engineer the island and gap energies in a SCPT and consequently we observe reduced poisoning and a modification of the thresholds for finite bias transport processes. Radio-frequency reflectometry is used to perform high-bandwidth measurements of quasiparticle tunnelling in a gap engineered SCPT. A model for the radio-frequency (rf) operation of the SCPT is presented and shows close agreement with experiment. Thermal activation of the quasiparticle dynamics is investigated, and consequently, we are able to determine energetics of the poisoning and unpoisoning processes. This enables an effective quasiparticle temperature to be determined, allowing the poisoning to be parametrised. An investigation of the use of normal metal quasiparticle traps for suppression of quasiparticle poisoning in SCPT devices is performed. To date, there has been little quantitative information about the behaviour of quasiparticle traps even though they have been used extensively. The work presented serves to clarify the nature of quasiparticle trap performance. Finally the single-quasiparticle sensitivity of the SCPT is employed to directly probe a few quasiparticle gas in a small superconducting volume. The quasiparticle population is monitored both in the steady-state and under non-equilibrium conditions of injection. In the non-equilibrium regime the quasiparticle recombination time is accessed from the response of the SCPT to pulsed injection. Agreement to previous experimental studies of recombination times in aluminium is found.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quasiparticle poisoning</field><field name="subject">single Cooper-pair transistor</field><field name="subject">Quasiparticles (Physics)</field><field name="subject">Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40940</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of putative functional motifs in viral proteins essential for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA replication</field><field name="creator">Woon, Heng Giap, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous virus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Although there are prophylactic treatments available, all current antiviral drugs ultimately target the DNA polymerase, resulting in the increasing emergence of antiviral resistant strains in the clinical setting. There is a fundamental need for understanding the role of other essential genes in DNA replication as a foundation for developing new antiviral treatments that are safe and which utilize a mechanism of action different to existing therapies. In this study we looked at six HCMV replication genes encoding for the DNA polymerase accessory protein (UL44), single stranded DNA binding protein (UL57), primase (UL70), helicase (UL105), primase-helicase associated protein (UL102), and the putative initiator protein (UL84) in order to increase our understanding of their role in DNA replication. The aim of this project was to identify variation within these genes as well as to predict putative domains and motifs in order to ultimately express and study the functional properties of the HCMV primase (UL70) through the use of recombinant mutants. Sequencing of these genes revealed a high degree of conservation between the isolates with amino acid sequence identity of &gt;97% for all genes. Using ScanProsite software from the Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) proteomics server, we have mapped putative motifs throughout these HCMV replication genes. In particular, highly conserved putative Nlinked glycosylation sites were identified in UL105 that were also conserved across 33 homologues as well as several unique motifs including casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (CKII) in UL105 and UL84, a microbodies signal motif in UL57 and an integrin binding site in the UL102 helicase-primase associated protein. Our investigations have also elucidated motif-rich regions of the UL44 DNA polymerase accessory protein, mapped functionally important domains of the UL105 helicase and identified cysteine motifs that have implications for folding of the UL70 primase. Taken together, these findings provide insights to regions of these HCMV replication proteins that are important for post-translation modification, activation and overall function, and this information can be utilized to target further research into these proteins and advance the development of novel antiviral agents that target these processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytomegalovirus</field><field name="subject">DNA Replicaiton</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43601</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The power relationships between doctors, patients and the party-state under the impact of red packets in the Chinese health-care system</field><field name="creator">Yang, Jingqing, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The paper examines ??red packets?? ?? a form of informal payment ?? in the Chinese health-care system from the perspectives of power and ??inxit?? theories.

Despite the diversity of applications that require proximity measures, the most intuitive notion is that of spatial nearness. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the underpinnings of the notion of nearness, propose suitable formalisations and apply them to the processing of GIS data. More particularly, this work offers a framework for spatial proximity that supports the development of more intuitive tools for users of geographic data processing applications.  Many of the existing spatial reasoning formalisms do not account for proximity at all while others stipulate it by using natural language expressions as symbolic values. Some approaches suggest the association of spatial relations with fuzzy membership grades to be calculated for locations in a map using Euclidean distance. However, distance is not the only factor that influences nearness perception. Hence, previous work suggests that nearness should be defined from a more basic notion of influence area. I argue that this approach is flawed, and that nearness should rather be defined from a new, richer notion of impact area that takes both the nature of an object and the surrounding environment into account. A suitable notion of nearness considers the impact areas of both objects whose degree of nearness is assessed. This is opposed to the common approach of only taking one of both objects, seen as a reference to assess the nearness of the other to it, into consideration.  Cognitive findings are incorporated to make the framework more relevant to the users of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with respect to   their own spatial cognition. GIS users bring a wealth of knowledge about physical space, particularly geographic space, into the processing of GIS data. This is taken into account by introducing the notion of context. Context represents either an expert in the context field or information from the context field as collated by an expert. In order to evaluate and to show the practical implications of the framework, experiments are conducted on a GIS dataset incorporating expert knowledge from the Touristic Road Travel domain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial reasoning</field><field name="subject">Spatial proximity</field><field name="subject">Spatial cognition</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Spatial knowledge representation</field><field name="subject">Spatial information theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43311</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative dispute resolution in local government planning in NSW: understanding the gap between rhetoric and practice</field><field name="creator">Rollinson, David Hugh, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for local government planning and development disputes in New South Wales. Set within broader theoretical concerns around key concepts, this research comprehensively documents, for the first time, how the ADR process of mediation was introduced to NSW councils and then used by their staff and independent ADR practitioners for disputes over development applications and the formation of local planning policies. The thesis also provides a systematic overview of the use of mediation and conciliation for development appeals brought before the Land and Environment Court of NSW (LEC).  In the 1980s there was considerable interest in ADR in Australia. Mediation was in use for community, family and business disputes and by the early 1990s was being suggested for environmental, planning and development matters. Its use was encouraged by government agencies keen to see a reduction in the costs of often   delayed council decisions on development applications. There was also a desire by councils to find a way to reduce the community disharmony that often occurred over large or contentious applications, or when changes to planning policies were proposed. Mediation held great promise in these early years but as this research shows, its take-up has been modest and its use variable. A detailed analysis of the encouragement to use ADR for planning and development disputes before councils and the LEC, together with an examination of policy and survey evidence, uncovers a significant gap between the promotional rhetoric and actual practice. From extensive in-depth interviews with council staff and ADR practitioners and through personal knowledge, it can be seen that the initial enthusiasm for ADR has not continued, with council staff now more commonly seeking to directly negotiate solutions to development disputes. The thesis concludes by considering the likely future for ADR in local government planning and development disputes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">alternative dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">town planning</field><field name="subject">mediation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42974</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of trauma-related time distortions</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Leah, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of dissociation are deficient, in that diverse symptoms are grouped under one global classification. This thesis used a multi-pronged approach employing clinical and analogue studies to deconstruct one commonly reported peritraumatic dissociative symptom:  time distortion.  Study 1 tested the proposal that time slowing during a traumatic event would be associated with the development and maintenance of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  The findings indicated that peritraumatic time slowing was associated with more severe PTSD symptoms and a threefold increase in the probability of PTSD three months later.  Study 2 examined qualitative aspects of time distortion experience during traumatic events.  The results indicated that time slowing was linked with the anticipation of aversive outcomes of the event.  Study 3 tested the hypothesis that increased arousal would be associated with overestimates of stimuli duration.  The findings indicated that higher levels of arousal were associated with longer time judgments.  Study 4 investigated hyperarousal in a naturalistic setting involving extreme stress in skydivers.  Higher ratings of fear were associated with a tendency to overestimate event duration.  Study 5 investigated hypnotically-induced temperature change and time perception.  The results indicated that highly hypnotisable hypnotised participants overestimated stimuli duration following a warming suggestion.  Studies 6a, 6b, 7 and 8 investigated whether emotional material was perceived differently to non-emotional material.  Studies 6a and 6b demonstrated that the duration of emotionally negative material was overestimated relative to neutral or positive material.  Study 7 examined the combined effect of valence and physiological arousal on time perception.  The results suggested that arousal mediated the effect of valence on time perception.  Study 8 employed clinical and non-clinical samples to investigate time perception for autobiographical memories.  The results indicated that people currently experiencing PTSD indexed greater estimates of trauma memory duration.  Study 9 examined the effect of perception of control on duration estimates.  The results suggested that perceived lack of control over negative stimuli was associated with longer duration estimates.  Together, the findings supported and extended existing models of time perception, and demonstrated that time distortions appear to be influenced by arousal, emotional valence, and avoidance reactions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42150</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of regulatory variation in multiple mouse tissues</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Mark, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recently, it has been shown that genetic variation that perturbs the regulation of gene expression is widespread in eukaryotic genomes.

Epidemiological data indicate that young men (15-25 years of age) make up one of the most vulnerable groups. The print media regularly portray men in this age group as aggressive and violent in various ways (on the sporting field, at war, in their cups, in contests and in leisure, all of which which take on many different forms). This dissertation presents a collection of such images gleaned over a number of years, the purpose of which is to evoke Durkheim's notion of suicidogenic currents that flow through the ??collective consciousness??, finding, according to Durkheim, their clearest expression in suicide rates. Using the notion of ??suicidogenic current?? as a sensitizing concept, this thesis traces the way in which violence weaves its way through social life and influences social relations that may be conducive to suicide.  It will be argued that the images presented ?? arranged, for effect, as photomontages ?? express the celebration of violence as a powerful social trend which runs not only through social activity, but also through hearts and minds of contemporary persons; as such, it constitutes one of the suicide-inducing conditions in contemporary society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Suicide</field><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="subject">Sacrifice</field><field name="subject">Durkheim</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42681</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards immunization of complex engineered systems: products, processes and organizations</field><field name="creator">Efatmaneshnik, Mahmoud, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Engineering complex systems and New Product Development (NPD) are major challenges for contemporary engineering design and must be studied at three levels of: Products, Processes and Organizations (PPO). The science of complexity indicates that complex systems share a common characteristic: they are robust yet fragile. Complex and large scale systems are robust in the face of many uncertainties and variations; however, they can collapse, when facing certain conditions. This is so since complex systems embody many subtle, intricate and nonlinear interactions. If formal modelling exercises with available computational approaches are not able to assist designers to arrive at accurate predictions, then how can we immunize our large scale and complex systems against sudden catastrophic collapse? This thesis is an investigation into complex product design. We tackle the issue first by introducing a template and/or design methodology for complex product design. This template is an integrated product design scheme which embodies and combines elements of both design theory and organization theory; in particular distributed (spatial and temporal) problem solving and adaptive team formation are brought together. This design methodology harnesses emergence and innovation through the incorporation of massive amount of numerical simulations which determines the problem structure as well as the solution space characteristics.  Within the context of this design methodology three design methods based on measures of complexity are presented. Complexity measures generally reflect holistic structural characteristics of systems. At the levels of PPO, correspondingly, the Immunity Index (global modal robustness) as an objective function for solutions, the real complexity of decompositions, and the cognitive complexity of a design system are introduced These three measures are helpful in immunizing the complex PPO from chaos and catastrophic failure.  In the end, a conceptual decision support system (DSS) for complex NPD based on the presented design template and the complexity measures is introduced. This support system (IMMUNE) is represented by a Multi Agent Blackboard System, and has the dual characteristic of the distributed problem solving environments and yet reflecting the centralized viewpoint to process monitoring. In other words IMMUNE advocates autonomous problem solving (design) agents that is the necessary attribute of innovative design organizations and/or innovation networks; and at the same time it promotes coherence in the design system that is usually seen in centralized systems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering immunity.</field><field name="subject">Complex systems engineering.</field><field name="subject">Complexity product design.</field><field name="subject">Blackboard data bases.</field><field name="subject">Complexity measures.</field><field name="subject">Multi agent systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43358</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Savings and recovery after extinction of a classically conditioned response in the rabbit</field><field name="creator">Weidemann, Gabrielle, School Of Psychology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis examined post-extinction recovery phenomena following classical conditioning in the rabbit. The first series of experiments examined the rate of reacquisition to the original conditioned stimulus (CS) and to a cross-modal CS following various amounts of extinction. In both the rabbit nictitating membrane (NM) preparation and rabbit heart rate (HR) conditioning, there was a graded reduction in the rate of reacquisition as a direct function of the number of extinction trials. In the rabbit NM preparation, there was also a graded reduction in the rate of acquisition to a cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light). However, concurrent recovery of responding to the original, extinguished stimulus (CSA, e.g., tone) during training with a novel, cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light), appeared uniformly robust even following extensive extinction. The second series of experiments examined the conditions necessary for concurrent recovery to occur in the rabbit NM preparation. The introduction of CSB-US pairings resulted in strong recovery of responding to CSA, while the reintroduction of the US alone failed to result in any discernable reinstatement of responding to CSA. Concurrent recovery was specific to the trained and extinguished CSA, with virtually no generalized responding to a novel cross-modal test stimulus (CSC). However, pretraining with CSB-US pairings significantly reduced the amount of recovery to CSA during subsequent CSB???US pairings. The third series of experiments revealed that concurrent recovery was specific to the extinguished stimulus (CSA) with only moderate generalization to other familiar but untrained stimuli in the same modality as CSA. Together these results indicate that concurrent recovery is not primarily the result of the unmasking of the original CSA-US association. Rather, concurrent recovery appears to be at least partially the result of learning-dependent generalization. However, in order for responding to CSB, to generalize to CSA, CSA must have been paired with the same US which is subsequently paired with CSB. Thus, the CSA-US association must be partially intact for concurrent recovery to occur. A layered network model with multiple hidden units is able to simulate rapid reacquisition, facilitated cross-modal acquisition and concurrent recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conditioned response</field><field name="subject">Classical conditioning</field><field name="subject">Rabbits</field><field name="subject">Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20646</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The detection and characterisation of Helicobacter species in Australian marsupials</field><field name="creator">Coldham, Thosaporn, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the hypotheses that the mucus lining of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of Australian marsupials is colonised with large populations of spiral and fusiform shaped bacteria, many of which belong to the genus Helicobacter and that these Helicobacter species are likely be unique. The presence of spiral and fusiform shaped bacteria in the GIT of 8 Australian marsupial species (32 animals in total) was examined using microscopy, culture and Helicobacter genus specific PCR. The marsupials studied included the brushtail possum, ringtail possum, koala, wombat, Eastern grey kangaroo, Tasmanian devil, Eastern quoll and long nosed bandicoot. The spiral and fusiform shaped isolates were characterised and identified using morphological appearance, Helicobacter genus specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons. The spatial distribution of Helicobacter species in the GIT sections was examined microscopically in silver stained sections of the GIT and using Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) with a Helicobacter genus specific probe. Spiral and/or fusiform shaped bacteria were detected and/or isolated from all marsupials studied. The prevalence and bacterial load of these organisms was found to differ in each marsupial species. These bacteria were found to belong to 3 different genera (Helicobacter, Campylobacter and Desulfovibrio). Each marsupial species appeared to be colonised with one or more unique Helicobacter species. Comparison of the detection of Helicobacter species in different groups of marsupials (herbivores, omnivores and carnivores) suggests that diet as well as the function and structure of the GIT may have a significant impact on their colonisation. Phylogenetic analysis of the new possum Helicobacters showed that they shared a common ancestor. Comparison of Helicobacter species isolated from different species of marsupial and placental mammals, as well as birds, showed that differences in environmental location i.e. gastric vs lower bowel had a major impact on the position of the Helicobacters on the phylogenetic tree.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marsupials</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22370</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of the mother-figure in the novels of Katharine Susannah Prichard and Eleanor Dark</field><field name="creator">Noble, Jenny Austin, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that through bringing together two branches of inquiry???the literary work of Katharine Susannah Prichard and Eleanor Dark and socio-feminist theory on health, contagion and the female body???the discursive body of the mother-figure in their novels serves as a trope through which otherwise unspoken tensions???between the personal and the political, between family and nation and between identity and race in Australian cultural formation???are explored. The methodology I use is to analyse the literary mother-figure through a ???discourse on health??? from a soma-political, socio-cultural and historical perspective which sought to categorise, regulate and discipline women???s lives to ensure that white women conformed to their designated roles as mothers and that they did so within the confines of marriage. The literary mother-figure, as represented in Prichard???s and Dark???s novels, is frequently at odds with the culturally constructed mother-figure as represented in political and religious discourses, and in popular forms of culture such as advertising, film and women???s magazines. This culturally constructed ???ideal??? mother-figure is intimately linked to nationalist discourses of racial hygiene, of Christian morality, and of civic and social order controlled by such patriarchal institutions as the state, the church, the law and the medical professions during the period under review. This is reflected in Prichard???s and Dark???s inter-war novels which embody unresolved tensions in a way that challenges representations of the mother-figure by mainstream culture. However, their post-war novels show a greater compliance with nationalist ideologies of the good and healthy mother-figure who conforms more closely with an idealised notion of motherhood, leading up to the 1950s. Through a detailed analysis of the two writers??? changing representations of the mother-figure, I argue that the mother-figure is a key trope through which unspoken tensions and forces that have shaped (and continue to shape) Australian culture and society can be understood.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dark, Eleanor, 1901-1985 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Pritchard, Katharine Susannah, 1883-1969 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Australian literature -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Feminism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">White women in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23897</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geology, geochemistry and geochronology of the Atnarpa Igneous Complex, SE Arunta Inlier, northern Australia : implications for early to middle proterozoic tectonism and crustal evolution</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Jian-xin.</field><field name="description">Three folded maps (1 col.) in pocket.

Applying public policy implementation theory to tourism research, this study investigates questions related to connections and collaborations between stakeholders, decision-making and inducing action and the relation between objectives in a strategy document and actual outcomes of a policy process. Two tourism planning strategies in rural peripheral communities of New Zealand&#65533;s South Island are investigated adopting a case study approach. While these strategies have in common their geographical and content foci, they differ in terms of commissioning agencies, stakeholder and community involvement, age, resource allocation and planning and implementation approaches. The strategies are four and eleven years old. One is a top-down strategy by a government agency, the other is the result of a community bottom-up process. 
 Using a pragmatic methodical approach and applying a framework that incorporates the implementation environment including stakeholders and decisive events during strategy making, this research assesses the two cases individually and comparatively. Thus applying a non-linear framework and examining strategies that allow for an investigation of longer implementation timeframes, this study overcomes long-standing issues in this type of research. It fills a gap in the literature as it is the first comprehensive analysis of tourism plan implementation to employ public policy implementation theory in one coherent case study approach. 
 The methods applied in this study include semi-structured interviews as well as content analysis of strategy and policy documents, internal documents such as minutes of meetings and newspaper articles. Starting with strategy makers and &#65533;key implementers&#65533;, a snowballing process was used to identify further interviewees and to also follow the policy process as perceived by the main actors in it. This combination of methods allowed for a discovery of the policy story; it assisted a process-oriented investigation of tourism plan implementation while at the same time providing factual information and verifying stakeholder statements through triangulating interview results with the content analysis of documents. 
 Overall, for both the top-down and the bottom-up planning case, implementation was found to be dynamic and highly dependent on the actors at the grassroots level. Many critical stakeholders are volunteer community members who have little or no experience in tourism planning. Most actors are tourism operators or are otherwise involved with the industry. However, as some actors are not actively involved in the tourism industry but represent interests related to the protection of the social and natural environment, their views and actions have the potential to be anti-tourism development and therefore they evoke conflict. 
 The two planning approaches do not differ significantly in terms of bureaucratic control and political guidance. Institutions such as, for example, district councils or economic development agencies, mainly impact on the availability of resources to plan and implement strategy goals. Whether or not goals are achieved therefore ultimately depends on the commitment and interest of all stakeholders involved. Other important factors for policy success are the stability of stakeholder relationships and the level of information and knowledge held by those stakeholders, particularly in situations where there is little support from agencies. This is evident where a stakeholder&#65533;s previous experience in community work and relevant know-how is considered an asset among the volunteers who are responsible for many of the projects. The potential for conflict and the necessity for implementers to &#65533;make do&#65533; with the funding, knowledge and information they have, accounts for high volatility of priorities and goals during implementation. 
 Key findings that relate to both the tourism planning and the public policy literature refer to the similarities of implementation processes for top-down and bottom-up strategies at a grassroots level, the significant role and decisive influence that inexperienced volunteer implementers have in such settings and the high degree to which policy change takes place during such processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">ecotourism</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Stewart Island</field><field name="subject">Rakiura</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090310.161051</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guanxi dilemmas and gatekeepers : a qualitative study of Chinese-Western intercultural relationships in marketing</field><field name="creator">Gao, Hongzhi</field><field name="description">Guanxi literally means a &#65533;special personal relationship&#65533; in Chinese social and business life. It is commonly considered a cultural barrier for many foreign entrants in China due to its exclusiveness, complexity and dynamics. This research study aims to understand the constraints and dilemmas in Chinese-Western intercultural business contexts. Specific questions addressed in this study are: (a) What are the constraints and dilemmas in Chinese-Western intercultural relationships in marketing? (b) How do business actors manage these constraints and dilemmas? (c) What new insights can be developed in order to improve Chinese-Western intercultural marketing relationships? These questions are important because most theoretical understandings of business relationships are developed in Western contexts. Furthermore, the emergence of China as a major global trading nation gives weight to these questions. 
 A case study strategy is adopted with a focus on Chinese-Western intercultural marketing relationships. This study follows the International/Industrial Marketing &amp; Purchasing Group (IMP)&#65533;s research tradition that views relationship building as the consequence of interaction among networks of actors. The research methodology is both qualitative and interpretive. A hermeneutical approach under the constructivist paradigm is adopted to interpret empirical findings from interviews with 58 Chinese and Western business managers. 
 Analysis was conducted in three hermeneutical stages. Each stage progressed and revealed new sources of understanding. The first stage provided a contextual understanding of Chinese-Western intercultural business relationship by identifying &#65533;three circles&#65533; of relationship development activity based on behavioural norms, respectively the insider (guanxi) circle, an emerging intercultural circle and an outsider circle. This allowed me to develop a bridging perspective of guanxi ties in the emerging intercultural &#65533;middle&#65533; circle. The second stage revealed three types of guanxi dilemmas for outsiders. The second stage also disclosed seven kinds of perceived risk derived from Confucian ideology. The third stage developed a new concept of guanxi gatekeeper. These guanxi gatekeepers play vital roles in managing outsiders&#65533; dilemmas and the risks perceived by insiders in developing intercultural (interpersonal) relationships. They engage two gatekeeping processes: reciprocal gatekeeping and symbolic gatekeeping. It is my conclusion that the gatekeeping view of guanxi processes provides an improved understanding of relationship development in Chinese-Western intercultural business contexts. 
 This study contributes to the marketing literature by identifying a new interpersonal network perspective and also the network position of guanxi gatekeeper in emerging Chinese-Western intercultural business networks. Thus, indirectly connected actors are seen to work independently but also interdependently through the involvement of gatekeepers. This study has an important strategic implication for Western entrants in China: Western firms and managers can avoid la guanxi (forcing direct relationships with innermost guanxi insiders) and instead operate through the facilitation of a middle force - guanxi gatekeepers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">business etiquette</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">corporate culture</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.otago.ac.nz./public/adt-NZDU20090417.113317</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption, degradation and transport of estrogens and estrogen sulphates in agricultural soils</field><field name="creator">Scherr, Frank</field><field name="description">The fate and behaviour of estrogens in the environment are of concern due to the compounds&#8217; endocrine disruption potential. Estrogens, namely 17&#946;-estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estrogen sulphates, i.e. 17&#946;-estradiol-3-sulphate (E2-3S) and estrone-3-sulphate (E1-3S) excreted by livestock constitute a potential source for estrogen contamination in the environment. A method was developed to separate and quantify the hormones by high-performance-liquid-chromatography (HPLC) and ultraviolet detection (UV). A combination of dichloromethane (DCM) and dicyclohexylamine hydrochloride (DCH&#183;HCl) gave recoveries from 97.3 to 107% for E1-3S extraction from aqueous solutions. The recoveries from soil samples ranged from 80.9 to 95.2% (E2-3S), and from 86.3 to 91.7% (E1-3S), respectively. Results of batch sorption studies showed that Freundlich isotherms were nonlinear (N &#8800; 1) with Kf values ranging from 34.2 to 57.2, and from 3.42 to 4.18 mg&#185;-N LN kg&#8315;&#185; for E1, and E1-3S, respectively, indicating the sorption affinity of E1-3S was about an order of magnitude lower than that of E1. The hydrophilic sulphate group of E1-3S possibly shielded the compound from hydrophobic interactions with the soil organic matter and allophanic clay minerals that were proposed as sorbents for E1. Contraction of clay minerals, &#8220;salting out&#8221; and competitive sorption of artificial urine constituents were likely to have been responsible for observed changes in Freundlich parameters when artificial urine was used as mediator matrix. Plotting the effective distribution coefficient as a function of hypothetical exposure concentrations facilitated the comparison of the sorption behaviour of both compounds as influenced by the mediator solution. The results emphasized that using the CaCl&#8322; matrix might result in false inferences for the sorption behaviour of these compounds in a dairying environment. The four hormones rapidly degraded in the agricultural soils under aerobic conditions, and the majority of the compounds degraded &gt; 50% within the first 24 hrs. Soil arylsulphatase activities were directly correlated with degradation rate constants of the estrogen sulphates. Estrone was identified as a metabolite of E2 and E1-3S, and these three compounds were observed as metabolites of E2-3S. Single-first order (SFO) and double first-order in parallel (DFOP) kinetics were used to model the degradation and metabolite formation data. The results showed that the DFOP model was in most cases better able to predict the parent compound degradation than the SFO model, and also enabled to estimate accurate degradation endpoints. ER-CALUX&#174; analysis revealed the formation of estrogenicity during E2-3S degradation, which could partly be explained by the formation of the metabolites E2 and E1. Transport studies with E1-3S and E1 showed that the transport and retention of both compounds were significantly influenced by the mediator matrix. While no breakthrough curves (BTCs) were recorded during hormone application in CaCl&#8322; (10 mM) both hormones were detected in the leachate when applied in artificial urine. Rate-limited sorption processes were proposed for the delayed arrival of the hormone BTCs compared with a conservative bromide tracer. Intense colouration of the leachate during the artificial urine experiments suggested the hormones were likely to be moved by colloid-facilitated transport. Furthermore, the detection of residue hormone and metabolite concentrations implied that degradation of E1-3S and E1 was hampered by urine constituents such as glycine and urea.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17-beta-estradiol</field><field name="subject">estrone</field><field name="subject">17-beta-estradiol-3-sulphate</field><field name="subject">estrone-3-sulphate</field><field name="subject">sorption</field><field name="subject">degradation</field><field name="subject">transport</field><field name="subject">ER-CALUX</field><field name="subject">kinetic modelling</field><field name="subject">arylsulphatase activity</field><field name="subject">metabolite formation</field><field name="subject">artificial urine</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::259900 Other Chemical Sciences::259902 Environmental chemistry (incl. atmospheric chemistry)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1017</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reverse genetic analyses of TERMINAL EAR-like RNA-binding protein genes in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

One MEI2-like gene has been identified in maize, while six have been identified in rice and nine in Arabidopsis thaliana.  In this thesis, a programme of reverse genetic analysis has been designed to investigate if Arabidopsis genes most closely aligned in parsimony trees with TE1, TERMINAL EAR-LIKE 1 (TEL1), TERMINAL EAR-LIKE 2 (TEL2), perform the same function as TE1.  The expression pattern of TEL1 and TEL2 genes is restricted to the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM) and the Root Apical Meristem (RAM) suggesting these genes are important in meristem maintenance or function.  Results of the molecular genetic analysis of TEL genes in Arabidopsis support models in which these genes help maintain cells in a pluripotent state.   For the first part of the thesis, analysis of lines carrying single knockouts of TEL1 and TEL2 and double knockout lines reveals a slightly accelerated rate of organogenesis, consistent with these genes normally acting to inhibit terminal differentiation pathways.  Plants grown on medium containing gibberellic acid and sucrose, at higher than normal concentrations, present a further accelerated rate of organogenesis. As the second part of the thesis, in situ and promoter/reporter GUS fusion analyses indicate TEL1 is preferentially expressed in both the root and shoot apical meristems.  Deletion analysis using GFP reporter constructs show that 5' sequences are sufficient to drive quiescent centre (QC) expression in the root while additional sequences are required for central zone (CZ) expression in the SAM.   Physiological studies indicate expression of TEL1 in the root is sensitive to the hormones, auxin, gibberellic acid and zeatin, when added at physiological concentrations. To confirm the auxin effect, GFP expression is no longer visible after 12 hours of exposure to auxin transport inhibitors in plants containing GFP under the control of the TEL1 promoter, suggesting, in common with other QC markers, that TEL expression is sensitive to auxin levels. Analysis of mutant plants with altered root patterning suggests QC specific expression of TEL1 requires early acting genes, such as PLETHORA 1 and 2, but does not depend on later acting genes such as SCARECROW or SHORTROOT.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/768</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the methods for estimating usual dietary intake distributions : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Statistics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stoyanov, Stefan Kremenov</field><field name="description">The estimation of the distribution of usual intake of nutrients is important for developing nutrition policies as well as for etiological research and educational purposes. In most nutrition surveys only a small number of repeated intake observations per individual are collected. Of main interest is the longterm usual intake which is defined as long-term daily average intake of a dietary component. However, dietary intake on a single day is a poor estimate of the individual&#8217;s long-term usual intake. Furthermore, the distribution of individual intake means is also a poor estimator of the distribution of usual intake since usually there is large within-individual compared to between-individual variability in the dietary intake data. Hence, the variance of the mean intakes is larger than the variance of the usual intake distribution. Essentially, the estimation of the distribution of long-term intake is equivalent to the estimation of a distribution of a random variable observed with measurement error. Some of the methods for estimating the distributions of usual dietary intake are reviewed in detail and applied to nutrient intake data in order to evaluate their properties. The results indicate that there are a number of robust methods which could be used to derive the distribution of long-term dietary intake. The methods share a common framework but differ in terms of complexity and assumptions about the properties of the dietary consumption data. Hence, the choice of the most appropriate method depends on the specific characteristics of the data, research purposes as well as availability of analytical tools and statistical expertise.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistical methodology</field><field name="subject">Estimates</field><field name="subject">Food intake distributions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230204 Applied statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/767</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposure of ewes to stressors in mid- and late- pregnancy : postnatal effects on the ewe and lamb : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Corner, Rene Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to examine the effect of maternal undernutrition and exposure to stressors between pregnancy day 50 to 100 and 100 to 147 of pregnancy on the ewe and her lamb. The long-term effects of these stressors during pregnancy on lamb growth, plasma cortisol response to a stressor, metabolism, behaviour and future reproductive success were examined. Mid-pregnancy shearing The component of mid-pregnancy shearing that causes the increase in lamb birth weight is unknown. It was hypothesised that the increase in lamb birth weight was due to the stress response of the ewe to shearing. This work examined the effect of a range of stressors at approximately day 80 of pregnancy. These stressors included yarding, crutching and sham-shearing that may be components of the shearing procedure that produce a stress response. In addition, repeated stressors between day 74 and 106 of pregnancy including isolation, sham-shearing and exogenous cortisol injection were used to examine the role of a longer-term stress response on lamb birth weight. Mid-pregnancy shearing has consistently resulted in an increase in lamb birth weight, however all the other stressors investigated had no effect. Therefore, the hormonal stress response of ewes to shearing was unlikely to be the cause of the increase in lamb birth weight. Mid-pregnancy shearing also resulted in minor changes in ewe and lamb behaviour 12 to 24 h after birth. Shearing during pregnancy had no effect on the cortisol response of ram lambs to handling or castration however differences were observed between singleton- and twin-born lambs. Ewe nutrition during pregnancy Ewes mildly undernourished in between days 70 and 107 of pregnancy that were then provided with adequate nutrition between days 108-145 of pregnancy gave birth to lambs with similar birth weights as ewes well-fed during both periods. Therefore the effects of undernutrition on lamb birth weight can be minimised if undernutrition can be limited to the earlier period (day 70-107 and 108-147 of pregnancy). Mild undernutrition in both periods (day 70 &#8211; 145 of pregnancy), resulted in lambs that were lighter and that exhibited behaviours associated with a greater &#8216;drive&#8217; to maintain contact with their dam than lambs born to ewes well-fed during the same period. This suggests that even mild undernutrition in both mid- and late- pregnancy should be avoided. The effect of maternal nutrition and lamb litter size on the behaviour of female offspring was examined at 1 and 2 years of age. Litter size had no effect on ewe behaviour at 1 year of age however at 2 years of age twin-born ewes had higher maternal behaviour scores than triplet-born ewe lambs. Nutrition of the maternal grand dam during pregnancy had only a minor effect on the behaviour of female offspring at 1 year of age and no effect on maternal behaviour at 2 years of age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Long-term effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300404 Animal husbandry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/763</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time facial expression analysis : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fan, Chao</field><field name="description">As computers have become more and more advanced, with even the most basic computer capable of tasks almost unimaginable only a decade ago, researchers and developers are focusing on improving the way that computers interact with people in their everyday lives. A core goal, therefore, is to develop a computer system which can understand and react appropriately to natural human behavior. A key requirement for such a system is the ability to automatically, and in real time, recognises human facial expressions. In addition, this must be successfully achieved regardless of the inherent differences in human faces or variations in lighting and other external conditions. The focus of this research was to develop such a system by evaluating and then utilizing the most appropriate of the many image processing techniques currently available, and, where appropriate, developing new methodologies and algorithms. The first key step in the system is to recognise a human face with acceptable levels of misses and false positives. This research analysed and evaluated a number of different face detection techniques, before developing a novel algorithm which combined phase congruency and template matching techniques. This novel algorithm provides key advantages over existing techniques because it can detect faces rotated to any angle, and it works in real time. Existing techniques could only recognise faces which were rotated less than 10 degrees (in either direction) and most could not work in real time due to excessive computational power requirements. The next step for the system is to enhance and extract the facial features. To successfully achieve the stated goal, the enhancement and extraction of the facial features must reduce the number of facial dimensions to ensure the system can operate in real time, as well as providing sufficient clear and detailed features to allow the facial expressions to be accurately recognised. This part of the system was successfully completed by developing a novel algorithm based on the existing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization technique which quickly and accurately represents facial features, and developing another novel algorithm which reduces the number of feature dimensions by combining radon transformation and fast Fourier transformation techniques, ensuring real time operation is possible. The final step for the system is to use the information provided by the first two steps to accurately recognise facial expressions. This is achieved using an SVM trained using a database including both real and computer generated facial images with various facial expressions. The system developed during this research can be utilised in a number of ways, and, most significantly, has the potential to revolutionise future interactions between humans and computers by assisting these reactions to become natural and intuitive. In addition, individual components of the system also have significant potential, with, for example, the algorithms which allow the recognition of an object regardless of its rotation under consideration as part of a project aiming to achieve non-invasive detection of early stage cancer cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing techniques</field><field name="subject">Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization technique</field><field name="subject">Real time</field><field name="subject">Human facial expressions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/762</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Childhood and compulsory education in South Australia : a cultural-political analysis</field><field name="creator">Wigman, Albertus.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 400-433.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Education, Primary South Australia History</field><field name="subject">Education, Secondary South Australia History</field><field name="subject">Children South Australia</field><field name="subject">Teenagers South Australia</field><field name="subject">Family South Australia</field><field name="subject">Family policy South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phw659.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6928019</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceived effects of work on health of rubber farmers in southern Thailand : a dissertation presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boonphadh, Piyaporn</field><field name="description">This study was conducted in a rubber farming community in Southern Thailand with rubber farmers and their first-line public healthcare providers as the study informants. The study aims were to first, explore perceived effects of work exposures in rubber farming on rubber farmers&#8217; health, second, identify decisions made in response to the effects of work exposures on health, and third, determine influencing factors on the construction of the perception and the process of decision making. Data were obtained using ethnographic research methods, underpinned by an interpretative paradigm. Unstructured interviews and participant observation were employed as the principal means of data collection. Together with the primary methods of data collection, note taking (fieldnotes, fieldwork personal journal, and photographs) and reviewing/analysing existing documents were employed. While data were being collected, initial data analysis was carried out to make sense of information gained and direct further steps of the data collection. After terminating the data collection, ethnographic data analysis suggested by Spradley (1979, 1980) was used to determine themes to meet the aims of the study. The study findings reveal that individual rubber farmers and healthcare providers construct perceptions of effects of rubber farming on rubber farmers&#8217; health and decisions on the actions taken to manage the rubber farmers&#8217; work-related health problems based on their own accounts of compounding factors. Among factors identified, discrepancies between health policy and its practice, coupled with the existence of a hierarchy of power-superior-inferior relationships among individual levels of health authority-emerge as the most powerful factors, inducing the emergence of other factors. Recommendations made as a result of this study draw attention mainly to the minimisation of the discrepancies between health policies and their implications, and the establishment of partnership status among authorised health agencies and between health agencies and rubber farmers in order to improve the quality of occupational safety and health services provided to the rubber farmers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rubber tappers</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Occupational health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321201 Environmental and occupational health and safety</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors associated with the transmission dynamics of bovine tuberculosis in New Zealand : a dissertation presented in partial fullfilment [sic] of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, Turitea, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Porphyre, Thibaud Francois Christophe</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of a series of studies on the epidemiology of TB in brushtail possum and domestic cattle populations in New Zealand. The first set of studies provides an analysis of the results of routine TB testing carried out in the Featherston area from July 1980 to June 2004. The median annual incidence rate of TB reduced from 4.7 cases per 1000 cattle-years at risk for the period 1986 to 1991 to 1.8 cases per 1000 cattle-years at risk for the period 1992 to 2003, coincident with the use of poisoning to control possums in the surrounding forest park (a major possum habitat area). We identified clusters of cattle TB cases adjacent to the forest park and found no evidence of spatio-temporal interaction of TB risk among farms. Our findings support the hypothesis that possums living in the forest park are a source of bovine TB in this area and that farm-to-farm transmission was not an important mechanism of infection spread. A mixed-effects Poisson regression model was developed to investigate the influence of farm-level covariates on the number of cattle confirmed with TB. The model showed that, despite intensification of possum control activities, proximity to forest parks remained a significant predictor of the number of confirmed TB cases per farm per year. Our analyses identified a significant, 3-fold increase in TB risk in dairy cattle relative to beef conditional on the size of local possum habitat, and confirmed the positive influence of cattle population size and the presence of previous infection status as a determinant of the number of confirmed TB cases per farm per year. The second set of studies investigates details of capture events recorded during a longitudinal, capturemark- recapture study of possums in a 22-hectare study site near Castlepoint, from April 1989 to August 1994. Social network analyses were used to identify contact patterns and to estimate the influence of contact on R0 for bovine TB. The average number of contacts per possum ranged from 20 to 26 per year. We estimated that TB would spread if an average of between 1.94 and 1.97 infective contacts occured per year per infected possum. We evaluated the effect of sex, habitat and contact behaviour of 26 postmortem confirmed TB cases in possums with those of 104 matched controls. Unit increases in the number of infected contacts increased the odds of TB infection by 2.61 (95% CI 1.29 &#8211; 5.29, P &lt;0.01). Our results show that individual contact behaviour is a determinant of the presence of TB foci within this population and challenge the hypothesis that contact with many individuals increases the probability of infection. A model to predict spatial variation in possum abundance was developed using a Geographic Information System. Details of possum capture events were obtained from 157 10-trap lines distributed within 42 randomly located transects at Molesworth Station. Two GIS-based models were developed to predict the number of possums caught per line using Poisson regression techniques. The first model used remotely sensed environmental data; the second used a combination of remotely sensed and fine-scale data. Both models provided adequate predictive ability with Pearson correlation coefficients greater than 60%. We conclude that the prediction maps produced from this model provide a useful decision support tool for possum control managers. These results have implications for the management of TB in this area of New Zealand, providing the information that will allow effective control activities to be applied at significantly lower cost.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Brushtail possum control</field><field name="subject">Cattle</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/761</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal harvesting strategies for fisheries : a differential equations approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Suri, Ratneesh</field><field name="description">The purpose of fisheries management is to achieve a sustainable development of the activity, so that future generations can also benefit from the resource. However, the optimal harvesting strategy usually maximizes an economically important objective function formed by the harvester which can lead to the extinction of the resource population. Therefore, sustainability has been far more difficult to achieve than is commonly thought; fish populations are becoming increasingly limited and catches are declining due to overexploitation. The aim of this research is to determine an optimal harvesting strategy which fulfills the economic objective of the harvester while maintaining the population density over a pre-specified minimum viable level throughout the harvest. We develop and investigate the harvesting model in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We first employ the Expected Net Present Value approach and determine the optimal harvesting policy using various optimization techniques including optimal control theory and dynamic programming. Next we use real options theory, model fish harvesting as a real option, and compute the value of the harvesting opportunity which also yields the optimal harvesting strategy. We further extend the stochastic problem to include price elasticity of demand and present results for di&#164;erent values of the coefficient of elasticity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Differential equations</field><field name="subject">Modelling of optimal fish harvesting</field><field name="subject">Expected Net Present Value</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics::230107 Differential, difference and integral equations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/765</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microrheological investigations of biopolymer networks : PhD thesis, research conducted at the Institute of Fundamental Sciences, Massey University of Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Romaric Remy Raoul</field><field name="description">is a major polysaccharide of the plant cell wall which is known to play a role in many mechanical functionalities, especially when a gel is formed in the presence of calcium. Understanding the gelling abilities of pectin is of great interest to the food industry also, since pectin is a widely used as a gelling agent and thickener. The aim of this study was to apply two complementary microrheological techniques to these systems, multiple particle tracking (MPT) and a light scattering technique called diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS). While the first one provides fundamental information about the homogeneity of the studied gel, the second gives access to the high frequency behaviour, related to the nature of the basic strands of the network. Firstly, after verifying the validity of the experimental apparati and analysis approaches in a series of careful control experiments on archetypal systems, a regime where pectin gels exhibit the signatures of semi-flexible networks was identified in experiments carried out on gels made of pectin chains pre-engineered by enzymatic deesterification and subsequently assembled with the release of Ca2+. These results were the first showing that polysaccharides networks could be accommodated within the framework of semi-flexible networks, which have become a paradigm for biological gels, such as the well-known F-actin solutions present in the cell cytoskeleton. However, in the plant cell wall, where calcium is already present, the assembly mechanism could be controlled in a different manner, and a more biologically relevant system was studied where the action of the plant enzyme pectinmethylesterase was used to liberate ion-binding groups in the presence of Ca2+. Gels formed according to this alternative methodology were found to behave as punctually cross-linked flexible networks, strikingly different from the first results. This would be explained by the presence of short blocks of charged residues. Finally, experiments on pectins carried out with controlled blocky structures showed that a pectin made of short blocks can exhibit both sorts of network, depending on the polymer and Ca2+ concentrations. This lead naturally to the construction of a state diagram for the regimes of assembly, with proposed control parameters being the polymer concentration and the ratio of the amount of Ca2+ to the quantity of pectic residues which can effectively bind the calcium into cross-links, christened Reff.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pectin</field><field name="subject">Gelling</field><field name="subject">Multiple particle tracking</field><field name="subject">Diffusing wave spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Polysaccharides</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/764</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International humanitarian assistance to Myanmar : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Inwood, Paul Douglas</field><field name="description">Myanmar is a country with many complex political and humanitarian issues. While it is rich in natural resources, it remains one of the poorest and most undemocratic countries in Asia. It has a history of ethnic and political division and many of the antagonists are still to find lasting reconciliation. Myanmar has been controlled by military juntas and former army generals since a coup in 1962. The focus of the regime is security and the preservation of its position as the ruling elite, at the expense of democracy and the humanitarian needs of the general population. The international response to the humanitarian plight of the Myanmar people has been mixed and the provision of international aid to Myanmar has become a highly contentious issue. This thesis seeks to critically examine international aid to Myanmar so as to determine whether under present conditions humanitarian assistance should, and can, be effectively provided to the country. In doing so recent theories relating to humanitarian assistance and intervention are reviewed and the historical and political circumstances that have influenced the humanitarian situation in Myanmar are explored. A description of the current humanitarian situation and levels of international assistance is provided, and donor, practitioner and activist perspectives on international assistance are determined. The results of this study show that Myanmar has serious humanitarian needs. Despite being a difficult environment in which to operate, with complex political problems, it is still possible to conduct effective programmes in the country. Existing programmes do not reach all those in need, nor do current programmes address many of the core problems. International assistance does help fill the gap left largely unattended by the junta. Any lasting political solution requires the participation of all stakeholders in the country, especially the military. As the junta is unlikely to relinquish political control, regardless of pressure levelled against the senior generals, the need for ongoing international aid remains obvious. When all the considerations about providing aid to Myanmar are taken into account, it is apparent from this research that the conditions are serious enough to justify that there is a humanitarian imperative to help, and that there are sound opportunities to do so.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myanmar</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/760</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of exercise-induced dehydration on cognitive ability, muscular endurance and surfing performance : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Sport and Exercise Science, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carrasco, Alexander Jason</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to measure the degree of dehydration experienced during surf practice and examine the effect this might have on surfing performance, cognitive function and muscular endurance of elite surfers.

The participants were randomly assigned to one of two trials: no fluid ingestion (NF) or fluid ingestion (FI) during 100 min of surf practice in a steamer wetsuit. The experiment was designed to emulate not only the physical and cognitive demands of surfing but also the ambient environment in which it takes place. Before and immediately after surf practice, the participants had their hydration status measured, completed a cognitive test battery and upper and lower-body muscular endurance tests. Surfing performance was assessed during the first and last 20 min of practice. At the conclusion of the NF trial, participants showed a 3.9 &#177; 0.7% body mass (BM) loss, this was significantly greater (P &lt; 0.05) than the 1.6 &#177; 0.7% BM loss seen at the end of the FI trial. In the NF trial, surfing performance decreased by 20.3 &#177; 7.1%, but showed a slight improvement in the FI trial (1.9 &#177; 10.2%). Of the six cognitive domains assessed (short-term memory, information processing speed, working memory, attention, visuomotor skill and visual acuity) all were significantly impaired when at a 3.9 &#177; 0.7% BM loss (P &lt; 0.05) yet were unaffected at a 1.6 &#177; 0.7% BM loss. Information processing speed and working memory were the most strongly correlated to surfing performance (r = 0.74; P &lt; 0.05). At the conclusion of the NF trial upper and lower-body muscular endurance were diminished by 21.2 &#177; 5.5% and 4.4 &#177; 5.8%, respectively. At the conclusion of the FI trial upper-body muscular endurance was reduced by 17.0 &#177; 4.1% while lower-body muscular endurance was marginally better (1 &#177; 3%). There was a significant difference in muscular endurance capacity between trials yet no significant correlation was observed between muscular endurance and surfing performance. The findings of this study suggest that surf practice for 100 min in a steamer wetsuit results in BM loss severe enough to significantly impair surfing performance, cognitive function and muscular endurance. Yet, when water is consumed during surf practice, surfing performance, cognitive function and lower body (but not upper-body) muscular endurance is maintained.

Its design and intentions required a shift in thinking within schools, in teaching and learning, and in the wider community. This had significant implications for the way schools managed curriculum implementation, for staffing in technology, and for resourcing. Professional development opportunities, funding support and support resource material were made available over a number of years as research in this area continued. Access to this support was not consistent for teachers and schools, and in some cases, not always sought. By the time the implementation of the technology curriculum became mandatory in 1999 for all students, Years 1 &#8211; 10, anecdotal evidence and some initial research showed that its interpretation and delivery in schools was varied,or no different from that of the previous workshop focussed syllabus.  This research sets out to discover how technology education has been implemented across a small selection of schools in the Wellington region and to consider the way school management and technology staff in each school have interpreted and implemented it. Student responses to this implementation are also examined. The study draws from four secondary schools, and the focus is on senior technology as this was viewed by the researcher as a level where the interpretation and implementation of technology education could be most diverse. Changes in national assessment practices also highlighted this diversity. Each school was treated as a case study involving interviews with principals, teachers and senior students, in order to examine how technology is understood and practised. The ways in which teachers and students understood technology is examined within a framework of contemporary national and international research literature. The findings need to be considered in view of the fact that only four sites were used, the research is interpretive in nature, and makes use of case study methodology. In other words, the results cannot be directly generalised; however, readers are able to identify from the descriptions the extent to which findings transfer to their own context.  The distinctive factors that emerged from this study highlight that the teachers concerned interpreted and implemented the technology curriculum with a strong consideration of their students&#8217; backgrounds, learning needs, abilities and aspirations. In addition, the teachers&#8217; own experience and qualifications, along with contextual factors associated with the school, such as its decile rating, appeared to be linked with the teachers&#8217; interpretation of the curriculum. Teachers identified a need for ongoing, robust professional development so that they could be confident in their practice, and have a common understanding of terminology presented in the curriculum and national assessment standards. Resourcing for schools in the form of facilities, materials and staffing was varied and also needed to be supported. The study also identifies further research requirements to inform and support this curriculum area. These requirements ask for the extension of the present research to other schools, the evaluation of professional development programmes in technology, and the evaluation of the impact of school technology programmes on students&#8217; learning and students&#8217; future educational/work pathways.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology curriculum</field><field name="subject">High schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/769</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of megakaryocyte-specific genes by Fli-1 and GATA-1</field><field name="creator">Eisbacher, Michael, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The successive activation of tissue-specific genes during cellular differentiation is orchestrated by the formation of transcriptional complexes consisting of cellspecific and ubiquitous transcription factors. Understanding the molecular events associated with normal megakaryocyte (Mk) differentiation is an issue of central importance to haematology. The aims of this study were therefore to: (i) define the transcription factors responsible for regulating the expression of Mkspecific genes such as Glycoprotein IX, (ii) identify the protein partners of such important Mk-regulatory transcription factors and (iii) examine the mechanisms utilised by these factors to regulate gene expression. First, the regulatory elements in the GPIX promoter required for basal and inducible expression were examined in megakaryoblastic Dami cells stimulated to undergo differentiation. The resulting data suggested that an Ets site in the GPIX promoter binding the Ets-family member Fli-1 was crucial in regulating both constitutive and inducible GPIX expression. Second, a two-hybrid screen of a K-562 cDNA library was used to identify transcription factors that interacted with Fli-1 and were potential regulators of Mk development. Results of this screen identified a novel protein-protein interaction with GATA-1, a previously well-characterised zinc finger transcription factor also implicated in erythroid and Mk development. Mapping of the domains required for the interaction show that the zinc fingers of GATA-1 interact with the Ets domain of Fli-1. The biological significance of the Fli-1/GATA-1 interaction was demonstrated in transient transfection assays, which resulted in synergistic activation of Mkspecific promoters. Analysis of Fli-1 and GATA-1 expression in a series of erythroleukaemic and megakaryoblastic cell lines demonstrated that the Fli- 1/GATA-1 combination correlates with a Mk-phenotype. Moreover, expression of Fli-1 in K-562 cells (a line rich in GATA-1 but normally lacking Fli-1) induces endogenous GPIX expression. Quantitative mobility shift assays reveal that Fli- 1 and GATA-1 exhibit cooperative DNA-binding in which the binding of GATA-1 to DNA is increased approximately 26 fold in the presence of Fli-1. This data provides a mechanism for the observed transcriptional synergy. In conclusion, this work suggests that Fli-1 and GATA-1 work together through protein-protein interaction and cooperative DNA-binding to activate the expression of genes associated with the terminal differentiation of Mks.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Megakaryocytes</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19171</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I don???t mind being a diabetic but not every day!: learning to live with a chronic condition</field><field name="creator">Demirkol, Abdullah, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic conditions and their management have become a major global public health problem which poses a serious challenge for both health care systems and affected individuals. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition affecting almost 200 million people around the world, a number that is expected to double by 2020. As with most chronic conditions its management requires significant and permanent changes in people???s daily life practices as well as a strict medication regimen. Recent research demonstrates that it is possible to control the complications of diabetes, and even to prevent its development in predisposed individuals by following recommended treatments. Yet studies show that only 2% of people living with diabetes heed their treating team???s advice. This signals a serious discordance between scientifically generated information and its place in the daily lives of people living with diabetes. This study sought to discover how to change the factors that prevent people with type 2 diabetes from following their recommended treatments. Firstly a participant observation process in four diabetes education centres was used to define the characteristics of the context in which people with diabetes and their treating teams interacted. This was followed by a nine-month participatory action process in two of the four centres in which participants defined the problematic areas in the management of their diabetes and devised plans to tackle these problems. They then attempted to implement these plans while exploring how and why their plans did or did not work. The findings indicate that the decision to follow recommended treatments is far from being a matter of individual choice. Rather it is heavily influenced by a complex interaction of numerous factors that people with diabetes have limited power to change. This study reveals that the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes could be enhanced where operational and practical knowledge about the condition is provided to people living with the disorder by health care providers responsive to patients??? perspectives, and where patients, providers and policy-makers recognise that health is a resource constructed in the wider social context, whose every element needs to be harnessed in encouraging people to make healthier life decisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23384</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Switching robust adaptive control in nonlinear mechanical systems</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Canh Quang, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work describes analysis, design, and implementation of a novel switching robust adaptive control (SRAC) method for nonlinear systems. The proposed method takes advantage of both adaptive control (AC) and robust control (RC) methods. SRAC employs one of the methods when this method is advantageous and switches to the other method when the other one becomes the preferred choice. To this end, RC is used to deal with transient effects caused by uncertainties and disturbances. The system switches over to AC for good steady state performance when certain switching criteria are satisfied. If external disturbances become dominant or new uncertainties are introduced while AC is active, the system will switch back to RC. In this manner, the switching process between AC and RC will continue to take place guaranteeing improved performance, robustness, and accuracy for the entire operation of the system. The novel idea behind the proposed method is a smart novel mechanism of bi-directional switching between RC and AC. In this mechanism, the involvement of estimators and switching rules play a decisive part in guaranteeing the smooth switching and the stability of the system. The implementation and design issues of the novel method were first evaluated by simulation on a mass spring system and then on a robot manipulator system. To control these systems with satisfactory performance, nonlinearities and uncertainties have been properly analysed and embedded into models and control algorithms. Simulation results showed the superior performance of the proposed method compared with other control methods. The experimental validation of the proposed method was conducted on a Puma 560 robot manipulator system which was established by joints 2 and 3 of the robot. Extensive comparative experimental results have validated the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed SRAC method over other control methods in the face of uncertainties and disturbances. As part of this work, a comprehensive dynamic model of robotic manipulator in the presence of joint motors, gravitational forces, friction forces and payload has been developed using MAPLE. A systematic design framework for the SRAC method has also been developed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonlinear control theory</field><field name="subject">Process control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive control systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24318</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specifying causal relations between students' goals and academic self-concept: an integrated structural model of student motivation</field><field name="creator">Barker, Katrina L.</field><field name="description">The central aim of this thesis was to investigate relationships between students&#8217; goals and self-concepts and to demonstrate how these two sets of motivational variables interact to influence academic achievement.

Although in the past survival for children with T-cell ALL (T-ALL) lagged behind that of children with pre-B ALL, the use of contemporary intensified treatment strategies has significantly diminished this difference, with many investigators reporting similar cure rates for both groups of patients. Despite these marked improvements, numerous challenges still face physicians treating children with T-ALL. Firstly, there have been no additional major improvements in outcome over the last decade, despite additional treatment intensification. Secondly, effective regimens remain elusive for treating children with relapsed T-ALL or patients with resistant disease. Finally, there is a need to identify patients currently potentially overtreated and thus unnecessarily subjected to acute and long term toxicities without benefit. A major challenge therefore, is the identification of novel reliable prognostic markers, in order to identify patients at high risk of relapse and conversely those least likely to relapse, to guide therapy appropriately. Children predicted with a high risk of relapse would be candidates for intensification of therapy and/or novel experimental agents. Conversely, patients predicted to be at low risk of relapse could be offered clinical trials using reduced intensity therapy, thereby minimising toxicity. '...' Crucially, the 3-gene predictor was validated in a completely independent cohort of T-ALL patients, also treated on CCG style therapy. Our 3-gene predictor appears to identify a high risk group of patients which require alternative therapeutic strategies in order to attain a cure. This study has also identified a potential novel agent for the treatment of T-ALL, which may be used as an anthracycline potentiator or anthracycline-sparing agent. We hypothesised that genes associated with a relapse signature provide promising targets for novel therapies. We tested the hypothesis that CFLAR, an inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and a member of the 3-gene predictor may be involved in the development of resistance to chemotherapy. To test our hypothesis we used a novel agent, 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1,9 (11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), previously shown to inhibit CFLAR protein, in two cell lines established in our laboratory from paediatric patients diagnosed with T-ALL. We found that CDDO displayed single agent activity at sub-micromolar concentrations in both cell lines tested. Importantly, minimally lethal doses of CDDO resulted in significant enhancement of doxorubicin mediated cytotoxicity in one of the cell lines assessed. The findings presented as part of this thesis have revealed the value of gene expression analysis of childhood T-ALL for identifying novel prognostic markers. This study has shown that expression profiles may provide better prognostic information than currently available clinical variables. Additionally, genes that constitute a relapse signature may provide rational targets for novel therapies, as demonstrated in this study, which assessed a potential novel agent for the treatment of T-ALL.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acute leukemia in children -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Acute leukemia in children -- Prognosis</field><field name="subject">Leukemia in children</field><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children -- Diagnosis</field><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children -- Prognosis</field><field name="subject">Oncogenes</field><field name="subject">T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)</field><field name="subject">Oncogenes</field><field name="subject">Prognosis</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0039</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying the social cognitive and sociological models of stigma to student attitudes towards major depression and bipolar disorder</field><field name="creator">Brans, Suzanne</field><field name="description">The aims of the current research program were to examine the social-cognitive and sociological models of stigma in relation to student attitudes towards an individual experiencing a mood disorder. Two experiments (Studies 1 and 2) sought to empirically distinguish between controllability and responsibility, both constructs of the attribution model which is subsidiary to the social-cognitive model of stigma. Despite manipulating controllability, participants were reluctant to attribute controllability of cause to individuals experiencing depression or bipolar disorder. The stability of beliefs about the controllability of cause for condition onset was consistent with research suggesting that the Australian public increasingly conceptualise mental disorders in terms of biochemical and genetic causal factors. These findings, in combination with past research linking biogenetic beliefs to negative attitudes, resulted in a change in focus of investigation in Studies 3, 4, 5 and 6 to explain why, contrary to the prediction of the attribution model, biogenetic explanations of mental disorders are associated with the proliferation of stigma. To measure causal beliefs, the Causal Belief Inventory (CBI) was developed in Study 3 and refined in Study 4. The correlational results examined in Studies 4, 5 and 6 found that genetic and biochemical causal beliefs were associated with a number of positive attitudes towards individuals experiencing a mood disorder and that genetic cause was associated with a reduced implicit bias against major depression. Furthermore, each study pointed to the centrality of judgments of differentness in determining affective responses and direct and proxy measures of behaviour. In contrast, manipulation of genetic and psychosocial cause in Study 5 found that causal condition largely failed to impact upon student attitudes. Mediator analysis did, however, find that beliefs about the stability of the vignette actor's condition fully mediated the relationship between the negative influence of genetic cause on proxy helping behaviour. Manipulation of psychosocial, genetic and biochemical cause with the inclusion of a non-depressed control in Study 6 resulted in more ambiguous findings. The combination of findings from Studies 1 to 6 suggest that focusing on the impact of the controllability of cause of depression onset on student attitudes is unwarranted. Instead researchers and public health educators should be examining models which facilitate the examination of the cognitive factors that mediate these relationships. Two such models, namely the social-cognitive and sociological models of stigma, were found to adequately fit the data. Recommendations for integrating these two models of stigma are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Depression, Mental -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Manic-depressive illness</field><field name="subject">Mental illness -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Prejudices -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Stigma (Social psychology)</field><field name="subject">Students -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">Mental disorders</field><field name="subject">Prejudice</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0041</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of compound dynamic accent markings in Beethoven's early chamber works with the fortepiano</field><field name="creator">Evans, Lely Dai</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to explore the functions and meanings of four frequently used dynamic accent markings (fp, rf, sf and sfp) in Beethoven&#146;s early chamber music with the fortepiano, with the consideration of acoustic qualities and playing capabilities of instruments intended for the studied works. The sources of reference here include the three Op.1 piano trios, two Op.5 cello sonatas, and three Op.12 violin sonatas, using a modern critical edition in conjunction with the first editions published during Beethoven's lifetime. The study consists of two parts. The first part surveys historical aspects including: 1) the development of relevant instruments, namely the bow and the fortepiano, and 2) existing accentuation conventions, especially those found in selected works of Haydn and Mozart, and appropriate treatises from Beethoven's time. The second part of the study entails the examination of consistency and frequency of dynamic accent markings in general, and that of individual accent markings using specific musical examples. The process of this investigation shows that these signs have distinct meanings, and consequently, require different treatments for their respective executions in performance. It also implies that the acoustic qualities of the ensembles with instruments from Beethoven's time are the most important factor contributing to variations found in his use of the accent markings among the different genres. Such acoustic qualities include the quieter volume and faster decay of the fortepiano, as well as the larger sonority from the cello especially in the lower register, when compared with instruments made for today's concert halls. These insights not only illuminate the possible ways to realize each marking, but also clarify accent markings which could seem inconsistent to modern performers, in terms of acoustic balance, especially in combinations that include the cello.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Beethoven, Ludwig van, -- 1770-1827</field><field name="subject">Chamber music</field><field name="subject">Music -- Interpretation (Phrasing, dynamics, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Musical notation</field><field name="subject">Performance practice (Music)</field><field name="subject">Piano music</field><field name="subject">Beethoven</field><field name="subject">Performance practice</field><field name="subject">Dynamics</field><field name="subject">Chamber music</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0042</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community and visitor benefits associated with the Otago Central Rail Trail, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Blackwell, Dean</field><field name="description">Outdoor recreation and heritage resources have the potential to provide a wide range of benefits to individuals, groups of individuals and the economy. An increased knowledge of these benefits can give recreation managers and planners a better understanding of how their actions and decisions regarding a resource may impact upon the visitors and communities that they serve. Placed within a climate of increasing public sector accountability, this information might also prove useful in justifying the allocation of scarce resources to recreation and heritage preservation. Justifying the value that recreation adds to society is an issue recognised by Benefits Based Management (BBM), a recreation management and planning framework that seeks to identify and target the positive outcomes realised by individuals, groups, local businesses and communities that result from participation in recreation and leisure. To date, recreation planners and managers have not been presented with a BBM research effort that seeks to describe and understand the visitor and community benefits associated with a rail to trail conversion. This study aimed to identify and describe benefits gained by visitors and neighbouring communities, with specific reference to the Otago Central Rail Trail (OCRT), Central Otago, New Zealand. Information was gathered from seventy-seven semi-structured interviews with visiting users of the OCRT, residents of neighbouring communities and trail managers. The results of the study indicated that community stakeholders reported benefits such as local economic development linked to visitor expenditure, heightened sense of community identity and solidarity and social contact with people from outside the local area. An additional finding was that the perceived benefits of the OCRT have reportedly had a positive influence on local people's attitudes towards the rail trail. Visitor interviews revealed that personal and social well-being benefits such as physical activity, aesthetic appreciation, sense of achievement, psychological refreshment, family togetherness and social interaction with friends and local people were outcomes of an OCRT visit. Reported visitor benefits were further linked to physical fitness and health, enhanced mood and positive mental state, leading a balanced lifestyle and stronger relationships within families and between friends. Visitors also perceived that an OCRT visit had forged a greater knowledge and awareness of railway heritage through gaining insight into railway and Central Otago history and appreciation of the engineering skills and craftsmanship associated with 19th century railway construction. Following the benefit chain of causality (Driver, 1994; Driver &amp; Bruns, 1999; McIntosh, 1999), interview responses were linked to potential community and visitor benefits that could be realised off-site such as enhanced quality of life, community satisfaction and a greater connection with and appreciation of New Zealand's historic and cultural heritage.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Benefits Based Management (BBM)</field><field name="subject">Otago Central Rail Trail</field><field name="subject">recreation planning</field><field name="subject">heritage preservation</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">visitor perceptions</field><field name="subject">Central Otago</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1027</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing wilderness as a phenomenological landscape: design-directed research within the context of the New Zealand conservation estate</field><field name="creator">Abbott, Mick</field><field name="description">This research operates at both the meeting of wilderness and landscape, and also landscape architecture and design-directed research. It applies a phenomenological understanding of landscape to the New Zealand conservation estate as a means to reconsider wilderness&#8217; prevalent framing as an untouched &#8216;other&#8217;. It does this through enlisting the designerly imperative found within landscape architecture as the means by which to direct this research, and through landscopic investigations located in the artefacts of cooking, haptic qualities of walking, cartographies of wilderness and a phenomenological diagramming of landscape experience. The results of this layered programme of research are four-fold.  First, it finds that a landscopic interpretation of wilderness, and its tangible manifestation in New Zealand&#8217;s conservation estate, has the potential to suggest a greater depth of dialogue in which both ecological and cultural diversity might productively flourish.  Second, it finds that landscape architecture has significant potential to broaden both its relevance and types of productive outputs beyond its current intent to shape specific sites. It identifies that artefacts and representations &#8211; such as cookers, track markers and maps &#8211; can be creatively manipulated to design alternative formulations of landscape. Third, through self-critique the potency of a programme of design-directed inquiry is demonstrated. In this dissertation new knowledge is revealed that extends the formal, diagrammatic and conceptual dimensions of wilderness, New Zealand&#8217;s conservation estate, and a phenomenological expression of landscape. This research illustrates the potential for design-directed research methods to be more widely adopted in ways that extend landscape architecture&#8217;s value to multi-disciplinary research. Finally, it finds a pressing future direction for landscape architecture research is to further identify and develop techniques that diagram landscopic practice and performance with the same richness and detail that spatially derived descriptions currently offer. It is the considerable distance between the spoken and written poetics of phenomenology and the visual and diagrammatic articulation of these qualities that is identified as a problematic and also productive site for ongoing creative research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscape design</field><field name="subject">wilderness</field><field name="subject">New Zealand conservation estate</field><field name="subject">research methods</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">outdoor equipment</field><field name="subject">path making</field><field name="subject">cartography</field><field name="subject">landscape visualisation</field><field name="subject">landscopic</field><field name="subject">landscape architecture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420302 Cultural theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1026</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative age dating of the Wahianoa moraines, Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand : thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Science in Quaternary Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nolan, Erin</field><field name="description">This study attempts to determine a relative age of the Wahianoa moraines, Mt Ruapehu using three relative age dating techniques: Lichenometry, Schmidt hammer and Boulder roundness. There were three study areas used, termed the Wahianoa &#8216;A&#8217;, &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;C&#8217; moraines. Upon determining a relative age for these moraines, their timing of their formation was placed within New Zealand&#8217;s glacial timescale. This is the first study of its kind conducted on Mt Ruapehu and has left the door open for more research in this field. The species of lichens measured on the Wahianoa moraines were Rhizocarpon subgenus, which the largest diameters were measured using callipers. A total of 606 lichens were measured in the Wahianoa Valley and were processed using the growth curve and size frequency methods. A lichenometric growth curve was constructed from lichens growing in the Ohakune cemetery. The dates derived from both methods placed the formation of the Wahianoa moraines during the Little Ice Age. An L-type Schmidt hammer was used on the boulders in the Wahianoa Valley. A total of 280 measurements were taken off the boulders on the Wahianoa moraines. The results of this method, when compared to Winkler&#8217;s (2005) study in the South Island placed the formation of the Wahianoa moraines pre-Little Ice Age. Although no definitive ages could be derived from this comparison due to differences in lithology between the two studies, it provided an idea as to where the formation of these moraines could belong. This is the first time that the Boulder roundness method has been used in New Zealand, having only been developed by Kirkbride (2005). This method was used to determine which of the ridges in the Wahianoa Valley were older. It was found that the Wahianoa &#8216;A&#8217; moraines were the oldest in the valley followed by Wahianoa &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;C&#8217; respectively. A climate reconstruction was also conducted for the Wahianoa Valley to see what conditions may have been in existence during the formation of the Wahianoa moraines. The paleo-ELA for the Wahianoa Glacier was estimated using the Accumulation-Area Ratio (AAR), Terminus to Headwall Ratio (THAR), Maximum Elevation of the Lateral Moraines (MELM) and Extrapolation methods. The current ELA was estimated using the AAR, THAR and Extrapolation methods. The difference between these estimates was used to determine what temperature decrease would have caused the formation of the Wahianoa moraines. The average paleo-ELA was found to be c. 1715m, while the current ELA was found to be 2475m which lead to a 4.5&#176;C decrease. This temperature decrease correlates well with that of the Last Glacial Maximum. This study found significant differences in relative age of the Wahianoa moraines. There are a number of factors that can affect the growth of lichens such as micro-environmentalconditions and the fact that a growth curve was constructed off site. Factors such aspetrography can affect the Schmidt hammer results and the Boulder roundness measurements. In addition, precipitation can affect the ELA values which can then cause the wrong placement within a glacial event. Further research lies in the use of the Schmidt hammer on a known age surface such as the Mangatepopo moraines which will aide in a better correlation of relative age. Also, further research using climate reconstructions on Mt Ruapehu and the effect of precipitation will also aide in a better correlation with a glacial event.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glaciology</field><field name="subject">dating</field><field name="subject">lichenometry</field><field name="subject">Schmidt hammer</field><field name="subject">boulder roundness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260115 Glaciology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/612</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency of techniques for post-translocation monitoring of the Duvaucel's gecko (Hoplodactylus duvaucelii) and evidence of native avian predation on lizards : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Winkel, Dylan</field><field name="description">Translocation of threatened reptile species to pest-free offshore islands is one of the most important conservation management tools available in New Zealand. However, a limited knowledge of how an animal responds to translocation and what factors threaten their survival prevails. Post-translocation monitoring is crucial and may help explain the reasons for translocation failure, but only if monitoring techniques are effective in detecting animals postrelease. This thesis documents the post-release response of two small populations of Duvaucel&#8217;s geckos (Hoplodactylus duvaucelii) using radio-telemetry, translocated to Tiritiri Matangi and Motuora Islands in December 2006. The efficiency of three standard reptile monitoring techniques, including spotlight searching, artificial refuges, and footprint tracking tunnels were tested and the impact of native bird predators on island lizards was investigated. Following translocation, no mortalities were recorded and the geckos increased in body condition by 22%. Post-release activity was shown by small initial movements within the first week, followed by increasingly large-scale (up to 480 m), non-directional movements thereafter. Range areas were atypically large (up to 7,820 m&#178;) as a result of the large-scale dispersal movements however few geckos did demonstrate small range areas. There were no sexual or island site differences in the dispersal movements or the range area estimates, suggesting that all geckos responded similarly to the translocations and release into a novel environment. Several neonate H. duvaucelii were captured on both Tiritiri Matangi and Motuora, and their high body condition scores indicated that they were capable of surviving and securing adequate resources. All three reptile monitoring techniques were capable of detecting H. duvaucelii at low densities these methods however differed significantly in their detection abilities. V Footprint tracking tunnels demonstrated the most consistent detection rates, probably due to the provision of attractive baits. Spotlight searching resulted in the recapture of 21% and 75% of founders on Tiritiri Matangi and Motuora, respectively. However, this method relied heavily on skilled fieldworkers. Artificial refuges (A.R.s) were the least effective for detecting geckos at low densities and A.R.s were only occupied by H. duvaucelii on Tiritiri Matangi Island. Environmental conditions significantly influenced the effectiveness of the monitoring methods, with temperature having a highly positive influence on tracking rates and spotlight encounters. Native birds, including kingfishers, pukekos, moreporks, and Swamp harriers are reportedly known to prey on lizards. Dietary analyses of these species revealed that lizards represented a large proportion of the prey for kingfishers on Tiritiri Matangi (88%) and Motuora (43%), and that kingfishers have the potential to seriously impact on small establishing lizard populations. Lizard remains were not present in the diet of any other bird species sampled and captive feeding experiments were inconclusive in determining if lizard remains could be detected in pukeko faeces. This research can aid in the further understanding of post-release responses of lizards to translocations and the factors that threaten their establishment. The provision of adequate habitat quality and size, release locations with a reduced number of known bird predators, and the instatement of long-term monitoring programmes will help improve the translocation success of threatened lizard species in the future.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">wildlife relocation</field><field name="subject">post-translocation monitoring</field><field name="subject">Duvaucel's gecko</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/758</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The binding of small volatile molecules by bovine [beta]-lactoglobulin : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Chemistry at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Yu-Ting</field><field name="description">Bovine &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-Lg) has been studied extensively but there is no clear identification of its biological function. Hydrophobic molecules have been observed binding into the hydrophobic calyx of &#223;-Lg. By comparison with other members of lipocalin family, it is probable that &#223;-Lg plays a role of transport of ligands, as ligands also bind into the central cavity of lipocalins. The structurally similar MUP is a pheromone-binding protein; therefore, it is possible that &#223;-Lg may also fulfil a similar role. This study has begun to test this hypothesis by investigating the interactions between bovine &#223;-Lg and several small volatile molecules (2-sec-4,5-dihydrothiazole, 3-methyl-2-butenal, 3-methyl-2-buten-1-ol and phenylacetic acid). The interactions between the volatile molecules and &#223;-Lg were studied by both two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallographic methods. TOCSY spectra were recorded for &#223;-Lg and the complex between &#223;-Lg and the ligands. The observed chemical shifts in the HN-Ha region are sensitive to the proximity of ligands, and hence chemical shift changes on ligand binding provide information on possible binding sites. It appears that several amino acids with hydrophobic sidechains are affected by interaction with volatile molecules at pH 2.0. The X-ray crystallographic study at pH 8.5 showed that the potential ligand, 2-sec-4,5-dihydrothiazole, may have decomposed into a linear 2-methyl-butanol. The refined structure (R=0.281, Rfree=0.354 for reflections to 2.6 &#197; resolution) reveals that the potential ligand may bind to the central cavity in a manner similar to the binding of 12-bromodecanoic acid to &#223;-Lg.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bovine beta-lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">molecular biology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/771</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A resampling theory for non-bandlimited signals and its applications : a thesis presented for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Huang, Beilei</field><field name="description">Currently, digital signal processing systems typically assume that the signals are bandlimited. This is due to our knowledge based on the uniform sampling theorem for bandlimited signals which was established over 50 years ago by the works of Whittaker, Kotel'nikov and Shannon. However, in practice the digital signals are mostly of finite length. This kind of signals are not strictly bandlimited. Furthermore, advances in electronics have led to the use of very wide bandwidth signals and systems, such as Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) communication systems with signal bandwidths of several giga-hertz. This kind of signals can effectively be viewed as having infinite bandwidth. Thus there is a need to extend existing theory and techniques for signals of finite bandwidths to that for non-bandlimited signals. Two recent approaches to a more general sampling theory for non-bandlimited signals have been published. One is for signals with finite rate of innovation. The other introduced the concept of consistent sampling. It views sampling and reconstruction as projections of signals onto subspaces spanned by the sampling (acquisition) and reconstruction (synthesis) functions. Consistent sampling is achieved if the same discrete signal is obtained when the reconstructed continuous signal is sampled. However, it has been shown that when this generalized theory is applied to the de-interlacing of video signals, incorrect results are obtained. This is because de-interlacing is essentially a resampling problem rather than a sampling problem because both the input and output are discrete. While the theory for the resampling for bandlimited signals is well established, the problem of resampling without bandlimited constraints is largely unexplored. The aim of this thesis is to develop a resampling theory for non-bandlimited discrete signals and explore some of its potential applications. The first major contribution is the the theory and techniques for designing an optimal resampling system for signals in the general Hilbert Space when noise is not present. The system is optimal in the sense that the input of the system can always be obtained from the output. The theory is based on the concept of consistent resampling which means that the same continuous signal will be obtained when either the original or the resampled discrete signal is presented to the reconstruction filter. While comparing the input and output of a sampling/reconstruction system is relatively simple since both are continuous signals, comparing the discrete input and output of a resampling system is not. The second major contribution of this thesis is the proposal of a metric that allows us to evaluate the performance of a resampling system. The performance is analyzed in the Fourier domain as well. This performance metric also provides a way by which different resampling algorithms can be compared effectively. It therefore facilitates the process of choosing proper resampling schemes for a particular purpose. Unfortunately consistent resampling cannot always be achieved if noise is present in the signal or the system. Based on the performance metric proposed, the third major contribution of this thesis is the development of procedures for designing resampling systems in the presence of noise which is optimal in the mean squared error (MSE) sense. Both discrete and continuous noise are considered. The problem is formulated as a semi-definite program which can be solved effciently by existing techniques. The usefulness and correctness of the consistent resampling theory is demonstrated by its application to the video de-interlacing problem, image processing, the demodulation of ultra-wideband communication signals and mobile channel detection. The results show that the proposed resampling system has many advantages over existing approaches, including lower computational and time complexities, more accurate prediction of system performances, as well as robustness against noise.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital signal processing systems</field><field name="subject">Resampling</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291703 Digital systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/773</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of herbicide behaviour in some innovative growing media : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">James, Trevor Kenneth</field><field name="description">An abundance of waste products from the forestry industry (sawdust and paper pulp) lead to the concept of using them as growing media for high value crops on a field scale. However, management of subsequent weed growth posed a problem as the impact of these novel media on the performance and fate of herbicides was unknown. Three aspects of sawdust and paper pulp waste were examined and compared to two cropping soils, viz. their effect on herbicide behaviour with regard to crop selectivity, weed control efficacy and the environmental fate of selected chemicals. Cropping species such as lettuce and onions were more susceptible to alachlor and chlorpropham in sawdust than in paper pulp. The two cropping soils evaluated (Horotiu sandy loam and Mangateretere silt loam) tended to be intermediate although the former was often close to the sawdust and the latter to the paper pulp in terms of herbicide phytotoxicity to the crop plants. For the less water soluble herbicide pendimethalin, the differences in crop selectivity in the different media were not significant. The effect of the media on the efficacy of weed control was evaluated through plant species with a much lower tolerance to the herbicides evaluated in contrast to the above species. For these plants the efficacy of the herbicides was generally lower in both the sawdust and paper pulp than in the two soils. The effect was more pronounced with the more soluble alachlor, where efficacy was reduced by factors of 5 &#8211; 10, compared to pendimethalin where efficacy reduction was by factors of 0 &#8211; 3. The two high organic media had contrasting effects on the various environmental behaviour indices evaluated. Herbicide adsorption as quantified by distribution coefficient (Kd) was higher in the two novel media compared to both the Horotiu and Mangateretere soils. However, when the Kd was normalised to organic carbon (Koc), there was less variation amongst the media indicating that organic matter is an important factor in controlling sorption in these media. However, despite the high level of adsorption in the sawdust, herbicides were most prone to leaching in this medium. Conversely the paper pulp tended to be more retentive while the two soils were intermediate. The degradation as quantified by half-lives (t&#189;) of the herbicides was generally slower in the two novel media, probably reflecting the higher sorption in these two media but also due to the lower level of microbial activity in the sawdust and paper pulp. The study shows that herbicide behaviour in these carbon based media differs significantly from that expected from soil organic matter, mainly due to the non-humified nature of the organic matter in the media and its poor biological activity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbicide phytotoxicity</field><field name="subject">sawdust</field><field name="subject">paper pulp</field><field name="subject">pendimethalin</field><field name="subject">alachlor</field><field name="subject">chlorpropham</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/774</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychological and workplace attributes that influence personal web use (PWU) : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Industrial/Organisational Psychology, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Polzer-Debruyne, Andrea M</field><field name="description">Using the Internet during work time for personal interest is defined as personal web use (PWU), yet only limited knowledge is available on why people engage in varying degrees in this activity. To address this shortcoming, this research project tested a heavily moderated theoretical model of thirteen psychological and workplace attributes expected to influence differences in individuals&#8217; PWU: moral norms, boredom, workgroup norms, workload, use of the &#8216;ledger neutralisation strategy&#8217;, certainty about PWU rules, attitude towards work, reactance, supervisor treatment, attitude towards PWU control, status, tenure and social loafing risk. Five facets of PWU were measured as separate criterion variables: past frequency, habitual PWU, duration, and two PWU activity types. Data for the model testing was gathered through an extensive on-line questionnaire. The responses of 267 participants with varying demographics and work situations were used to test the theoretical model, using moderated regression analyses. Significant interactions were explored further through the Modgraph procedure. The model testing results showed that PWU was more common in respondents who morally approved of PWU and who were bored at their work. How often people engaged in PWU (either out of habit or in general), for how long and in what types of activities, was influenced by specific combinations of the remaining attributes. Only four of the hypothesised twelve interactions played statistically significant roles, only habitual PWU was influenced by workload; and only information-seeking activities were influenced by workgroup norms. Attributes with &#8216;revenge&#8217; connotations were noticeably absent as significant influences. The findings are discussed in some detail. To further explore the context of PWU, thematic analysis was undertaken of answers to two open-response questions provided by a sub-sample of 119 participants. Results supported the role of workplace boredom in PWU situations, specified the moral issues of PWU approval, and suggested that PWU is best understood and examined in the wider context of organisational culture. The thesis concludes with synthesis and discussion of statistical and qualitative analyses results, identifying the contributions the research has made to the field of study. Suggested practical applications of the findings, limitations of the research project and suggestions for future studies conclude the documentation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational Psychology</field><field name="subject">Personal Web Use</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380108 Industrial and organisational psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/772</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation behaviour of diamond-like carbon coatings on silicon substrates</field><field name="creator">Haq, Ayesha Jabeen, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The deformation mechanisms operating in diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on (100) and (111) Si, has been investigated. The effect of coating thickness, indenter geometry, substrate orientation and deposition technique on the deformation of DLC coatings and the underlying substrate was studied by undertaking nanoindentation followed by subsurface microstructural characterization. Uncoated (111) Si was also investigated for comparison. The observed microstructural features were correlated to the indentation response of the coatings and compared with simulation studies, as well as observations on uncoated Si.  In uncoated (111) Si, phase transformation was found to be responsible for the discontinuities in the load-displacement curves, similar to (100) Si. However, slip was activated on {311} planes instead of on {111} planes. Moreover, the density of defects was also significantly lower and their distribution asymmetric.  The coatings were adherent, uniformly thick and completely amorphous. The load-displacement curves displayed several pop-ins and a pop-out, the indentation loads for the first pop-in and the pop-out depending primarily on the thickness of the coating. The coatings exhibited localized compressive deformation in the direction of loading without any through-thickness cracks. The extent of this localized deformation increased with indentation load. Hardness and thickness of the coatings and the geometry of the indenter influenced the magnitude of compressive strains. Harder and thinner coatings and a blunt indenter exhibited the minimum degree of deformation. Densification by rearrangement of molecules has been suggested as the mechanism responsible for plastic compression.  At indentation loads corresponding to the first pop-in, (100) and (111) silicon substrates initially deformed by &lt;111&gt; and &lt;311&gt; slip respectively. Higher indentation loads caused phase transformation. Therefore, unlike in uncoated Si, dislocation nucleation in the Si substrate has been proposed as the mode responsible for the first pop-in. Subsequent pop-ins were attributed to further deformation by slip and twinning, phase transformation and extensive cracking (median and secondary cracks) of the substrate. The pop-out, however, was ascribed to phase transformation. Extensive deformation in the substrate, parallel to the interface, is attributed to the wider distribution of the stress brought about by the DLC coating. Good correlation was obtained between the nanoindentation response, microstructural features and simulation studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Diamond-like carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanoindentation</field><field name="subject">Deformation</field><field name="subject">Focussion ion beam microscopy</field><field name="subject">Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42692</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powerplay: video games, subjectivity and culture</field><field name="creator">Tulloch, Rowan Christopher, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines single-player video gaming. It is an analysis of video game play: what it is, how it functions, and what it means. It is an account of how players learn to play. This is done through a set of close readings of significant video games and key academic texts. My focus is on the mechanisms and forces that shape gameplay practices. Building on the existing fields of ludology and media-studies video-game analysis, I outline a model of video game play as a cultural construction which builds upon the player's existing knowledge of real world and fictional objects, scenarios and conventions. I argue that the relationship between the video game player and the software is best understood as embodying a precise configuration of power. I demonstrate that the single-player video game is in fact what Michel Foucault terms a 'disciplinary apparatus'. It functions to shape players' subjectivities in order to have them behave in easily predicted and managed ways. To do this, video games reuse and repurpose conventions from existing media forms and everyday practices. By this mobilisation of familiar elements, which already have established practices of use, and by a careful process of surveillance, examination and the correction of play practices, video games encourage players to take on and perform the logics of the game system. This relationship between organic player and technological game, I suggest, is best understood through the theoretical figure of the 'Cyborg'. It is a point of intersection between human and computer logics. Far from the ludological assumption that play and culture are separate and that play is shaped entirely by rules, I show video game play to be produced by an array of complex cultural and technological forces that act upon the player. My model of video game play differs from others currently in circulation in that it foregrounds the role of culture in play, while not denying the technological specificity of the video gaming apparatus. My central focus on power and the construction of player subjectivities offers a way to move beyond the simplistic reliance on the notion that rules are the primary shaping mechanism of play that has, to date, dominated much of video game studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer games</field><field name="subject">Video games</field><field name="subject">Ludology</field><field name="subject">Post-structuralism</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43519</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value added tax in Ethiopia: A study of operating costs and compliance</field><field name="creator">Yesegat, Wollela Abehodie, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the operating costs of, and intentional compliance with, the value added tax (VAT) in Ethiopia. The study focuses on assessing the magnitude and nature of operating costs, identifying areas in the design and administration of the tax that contribute to the operating costs and the problems in the operation of the tax at large, and also on the link between VAT compliance costs and intentional output VAT reporting compliance decisions. The study adopts a mixed methods research approach to test a series of hypotheses and answer research questions that emerge through the review of existing literature and the experiences of the researcher in respect of the Ethiopian tax system. Specifically, the study uses surveys of taxpayers and tax practitioners, experimental design, interviews with tax officials and documentary analysis. The study statistically analyses the data elicited from the surveys and experimental design. It also analyses the results of in-depth interviews with tax officials and examination of documents held by tax authorities and other institutions. The results of this combined research methodology reveal that VAT operating costs in Ethiopia in the fiscal year 2005/06 appear to be relatively low. However, this low level of operating costs may not imply that the VAT system in Ethiopia is simple. In particular, in the case of administrative costs it is argued that it may indicate that the tax authorities are under-resourced which in turn may have affected their ability to accomplish the responsibilities entrusted to them. In respect of compliance costs, although the total costs seem to be low, it is contended that their regressiveness is likely to impact on the equity of the tax system as a whole. Further, the results show that VAT compliance costs and intentional VAT reporting compliance decisions are inversely correlated; but this correlation is statistically weak. The results also identify several concerns in the design and administration of the tax that have bearing on the operating costs and the operation of the tax. Specifically, the existence of the relatively high registration threshold, the high frequency of VAT reporting, the use of the invoice method of accounting (the latter two pertain mainly to small businesses) and weak administration are noted. iv The thesis suggests a series of measures which could be taken by the government and by the tax authorities in particular, to address the various problems identified in the study. These measures include strengthening the administration; allowing small businesses to adopt the cash basis of accounting and report less frequently; and reducing the registration threshold. The use of tax education is also emphasised as a strategy to improve compliance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">Value added tax</field><field name="subject">operating costs</field><field name="subject">Ethiopia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43317</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and validation of a C5/C6 motion segment model</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Thomas J., Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is a large body of work investigating whiplash-associated injury in motor vehicles and its causation. Being unable to detect the actual injury and having to use the symptoms of the sufferer as a surrogate has made progress in understanding the injury causation slow. Still lacking are the causal relationships between the biomechanical load on the vehicle occupant in the crash, the resulting loading on the neck and the actual injuries suffered. The optimisation of the design of vehicle safety systems to minimise whiplash needs a better understanding of human tolerance to these injuries. This thesis describes the development of a mathematical multi-body C5/C6 motion segment model to investigate the causation of soft-tissue neck injury. This model was validated with available static in-vitro experimental data on excised motion-segments and then integrated into the existing, validated multi-body human head and neck model developed by van der Horst, to allow the application of realistic dynamic loads. The responses and injury sensing capability of the C5/C6 model were compared with available data for volunteers and cadavers in rear impacts. The head and neck model was applied to the investigation of a group of real rear impact crashes (n = 78) of vehicles equipped with a crash-pulse recorder and with known postcrash injury outcomes. The motion of the occupants in these crashes had previously been reconstructed with a MADYMO BioRID II dummy-in-seat model validated by sled testing. The occupant T1 accelerations from these reconstructions were used to drive the head and neck model. The soft-tissue loading at C5/C6 of the head and neck model was analysed during the early stage of the impact, prior to contact with the head restraint. The loading and the pain outcome from the vehicle occupants in the actual crash were compared statistically. For the longer-term whiplash-associated pain outcomes (of greater than 1 month duration) for these occupants, the C5/C6 model indicated good correlation with the magnitude of the shear loading on the facet capsule. In lower severity impacts, the model result supported a second hypothesis of injury to this motion segment: facet surface impingement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whiplash injuries</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23086</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transcriptional and physiological alterations in brewers yeast when shifted from anaerobic to aerobic growth conditions</field><field name="creator">Beckhouse, Anthony Gordon, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Yeast are exposed to many physical and chemical stresses when used in large-scale industrial fermentations, particularly the initial stages in which yeast are shifted from anaerobic storage to aerated wort. This work investigated the transcriptional and physiological responses of yeast that had been shifted from anaerobic to aerobic growth conditions. Microarray technology was employed to determine the transcriptional changes that occurred in the first hour of a pilot-plant fermentation compared to the 23rd hour. It was found that over 100 genes were up-regulated initially including genes involved in the synthesis of the essential membrane sterol ergosterol and genes for the protection of cells against oxidative stress. It was also determined that cells which accumulate ergosterol precursors in the absence of ergosterol were more sensitive to exogenous oxidative stresses, indicating a role for ergosterol in oxidative stress tolerance. Aeration of anaerobically grown cells did not affect their growth kinetics or viability. However, anaerobically grown cells were hypersensitive to exogenous oxidative stress compared to their aerobic counterparts. Anaerobic cells that underwent a short period of aeration prior to treatment with hydrogen peroxide generated a tolerance to the oxidant, indicating that the period of aeration produced an adaptive-like response. Microarray analysis of the cells during the period of aeration showed that representative genes from the oxidative stress response family were up-regulated rapidly and it was determined that the response was controlled by the Yap1p and Skn7p transcription factors. Deletion of the transcription factor genes indicated that they were responsible for the creation of tolerance to oxidant. Target gene products of the two transcription factors (Gpx2p, Gsh1p and Trx2p) were shown to be induced during the shift to aeration; however, the glutathione redox balance did not seem to be affected as the cells were shifted from highly reduced to oxidising environments. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that genes involved in the synthesis of amino acids were up-regulated during anaerobic growth and stringently downregulated upon aeration of cells. The transcriptional activator of those genes  (Gcn4p) was essential for growth in anaerobic media which included amino acid supplementation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Yeast fungi - Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Fermentation</field><field name="subject">Yeast - Aeration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24201</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays in optimal auction design</field><field name="creator">Jarman, Ben</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (Economics)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">auctions</field><field name="subject">mechanism design</field><field name="subject">game theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4627</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the social impacts of festivals on communities</field><field name="creator">Small, Katie E.</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to understand the social impacts that festivals have on their host communities. It focuses on community festivals as one type of event which have a particularly strong connection to their host community. Community festivals are traditionally organised by and for the local community, and often celebrate a theme that has developed from within the community itself. Community festivals provide members of a community with opportunities to engage in socialisation, entertainment and the establishment of social networks, which can contribute to the enhancement of community cohesion and the building of social capital within a community. Additionally, they can provide tourism benefits such as increased visitation and promotion of a destination&#8217;s image. However, there is the potential for negative social impacts to result from the hosting of a festival, including traffic congestion, overcrowding, vandalism and increased antisocial behaviour. This thesis seeks to understand the perceived social impacts of community festivals from the perspective of the resident population. Six important questions are addressed in this thesis: 1) what are the underlying dimensions of the social impacts of community festivals?; 2) what are a host community&#8217;s expectations and perceptions of the social impacts of a festival?; 3) are there distinct subgroups within a community who differ in their feelings towards a festival?; 4) do these subgroups hold differing perceptions of the social impacts of community festivals?; 5) can the Social Impact Perception (SIP) scale be used to measure residents&#8217; perceptions of the social impacts of community festivals?; and 6) what are the implications of this research for the planning and management of future community festivals? In order to explore these issues, this study draws on literature from the areas of tourism and sociology. It is from the tourism literature, more specifically on events, that community festivals are introduced as the focus of this thesis. The sociological literature on communities reinforces the importance of the &#8216;community&#8217; in community festivals, and examines the role that festivals can play in contributing to community development, community wellbeing and the enhancement of social capital. Two community festivals were studied, one in Western Australia and the other in Victoria, Australia. Data were collected from residents in each of these two communities at one point in time following the staging of their festival. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used, including semi-structured interviews, focus groups, observational techniques, document analysis and a residents&#8217; perceptions questionnaire. The results revealed that there are distinct subgroups within a community who choose to be involved with their festival in a range of ways and who perceive the social impacts resulting from the festival quite differently. These subgroups have been labelled the tolerators, economically connected, attendees, avoiders and volunteers. Whilst holding varied perceptions of the positive and negative nature of the impacts and levels at which they occur, residents perceive the social impacts of community festivals to occur within six impact dimensions: inconvenience, community identity and cohesion, personal frustration, entertainment and socialisation opportunities, community growth and development, and behavioural consequences. Those residents who participate in the festival, either as volunteers or attendees, tend to be those who are most positive about the festival and its impacts. This participation in the community provides opportunities for social transactions, relationship building and the development of social networks, which in turn have positive outcomes for community wellbeing and the development of social capital. This research has a number of implications for the management of future community festivals, in respect to providing a better understanding of residents&#8217; perceptions of the social impacts a festival creates; towards better satisfying the diverse needs of distinct community subgroups; and related to how festivals can be used to contribute to community wellbeing and the enhancement of social capital.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">festivals</field><field name="subject">social aspects</field><field name="subject">community organization</field><field name="subject">culture and tourism</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37653</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional Development and Telecommunications Policy in Western Australia: Accessing knowledge to inform policy through complexity and action research</field><field name="creator">suheureux@gmail.com</field><field name="description">This study explores how governments use knowledge to inform telecommunications policy-making and policy-implementation in regional development. It focuses on epistemological aspects and assumptions made within the parameters of Enlightenment thinking or the Newtonian paradigm, also known as the classical scientit1c paradigm. It argues that lmowledge formed within this paradigm, usually generated at a distance, has been individ,uated, detached, segmented and abstracted. 'Individuation' focuses on individuals and things rather than communities and processes. 'Detachment' separates the subjective mind from the objective environment to produce reliable information. 'Segmentation' produces validity of information by parsing the objective environment from its social and historical context. 'Abstraction' allows objectivity and systematisation of information. When used to inform policy, such knowledge creates a narrow 'standardising gaze' that 'disciplines' communities to conform to dominant social behaviour and beliefs. Case studies are used to demonstrate that the two major models of development, as products ofthis paradigm, employ this gaze rendering replicability difficult ifnot impossible. These models are the top-down and bottom-up approach that are epitomised by the Silicon Valley model and telecentre moveluent respectively. How this gaze inhibits/facilitates development in policy implementation is then examined in the Goldfields Esperance region in Western Australia. An holistic approach using cotnplex adaptive systems is used to understand the multidisciplinary aspects involved in development. This is combined with action research, a reflexive methodology. Action research has the ability to access local knowledge to provide data and evaluation in situ rather than on a post hoc basis. The findings demonstrate that complex systems analysis and action research provide a modus operandi that: a) recognises the interplay of various factors (such as power relations, economic cycle, social and political institutions) at different levels of the system; b) recognises time, context and path-dependence of regional development; c) provides a filter that minimises the 'standardising gaze' and d) gives an access to knowledge and insight to local issues, which can facilitate policy implementation of development that is sympathetic to regional communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telecommunications</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">regional development</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070427.120905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adelaide's future water supply : an assessment of alternatives</field><field name="creator">Manwaring, Edwin Albert.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 118-127.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SEW</field><field name="subject">Water-supply South Australia Adelaide Planning</field><field name="subject">Saline water conversion Distillation process</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ENV/09envm295.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6930987</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The significant past in Australian thought : some studies in nineteenth century Australian thought and its British background</field><field name="creator">Partington, Geoffrey.</field><field name="description">Typescript (photocopy) Bibliography: leaves 779-813.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Politics and culture Australia</field><field name="subject">Political participation Australia</field><field name="subject">Political sociology</field><field name="subject">Australia Social conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09php2732.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6964032</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative ion chemistry of boron and carbon compounds</field><field name="creator">Currie, Graeme.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 134-148.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Organoboron compounds</field><field name="subject">Chemical ionization mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc9762.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6964050</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some problems in queueing theory</field><field name="creator">Coyle, Andrew James.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 147-152.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Queuing theory</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phc8812.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:6964054</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of the River Murray during periods of extended drought</field><field name="creator">Burton, C.

Exploring the relationship between Spiritual engagement and the sexual health activities of Samoan youth. Improving the health and social wellbeing of Pacific youth is a key priority for the New Zealand Government. When the Pacific youth population&#8217;s sexual health is compared with that of other ethnic groups in New Zealand there are clear disparities. At the same time, spiritual engagement is frequently noted as protecting young people from engaging in health-risk taking behaviours. Objectives: This study determines whether a relationship exists between patterns of spiritual engagement and the sexual health activities of Samoan attending secondary schools in New Zealand. Does going to church or rating spiritual beliefs as important influence the sexual health activities of Samoan youth? Method: This research analyses data from &#8216;Youth 2000&#8217;, a youth health and wellbeing survey conducted in 2001. The survey was conducted with approximately 10,000 New Zealand secondary school students which included 646 Samoan and 5219 New Zealand Europeans. Nine sexual health activities were explored. Data relating to spiritual engagement and the sexual health activities of Samoan and New Zealand European students were extracted from the survey, measured and compared. Results: A significant proportion of Samoan youth have not had sexual intercourse. Just under a third of Samoan students (32.1%) have had sexual intercourse, with the average age of first sexual intercourse around 14 years. Findings reveal that the spiritual engagement variables: church attendance and the importance of spiritual beliefs have mixed influences on the different sexual health activities of Samoan youth. Conclusions: This study reinforces the central importance of spiritual engagement in the lives of many Samoan secondary school students. Government policies and interventions require an understanding of key health behaviours and their related risk and protective factors specific to New Zealand youth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spirituality</field><field name="subject">sexual health behaviour</field><field name="subject">Samoan youth</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">spiritual engagement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/783</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biofilm formation by Campylobacter jejuni in controlled mixed-microbial populations : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Teh, Koon Hoong</field><field name="description">Poultry meat consumption in New Zealand has been increasing since 1975 with the highest peak reported in 2006. The total poultry meat consumption was 36.5 kg per capita in the year ending September 2006. Consumption of contaminated food with raw poultry can lead to campylobacteriosis, which is a food-borne disease that causes gastroenteritis in humans and it is a major problem in New Zealand. There were 12,776 reported cases of campylobacteriosis in 2007, which accounts for 65.9% of the overall notified diseases. Campylobacteriosis can lead to Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome in some patients, an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Campylobacteriosis is caused by consumption of either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli. Campylobacter spp. have been found in commercially raised poultry being infected predominantly by C. jejuni. C. jejuni has been found associated with biofilms of other bacterial species in the watering supplies and plumbing systems of animal husbandry facilities and animalprocessing plants. A biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells that is associated with a surface and the cells are enclosed in a matrix of polysaccharides, which provides a survival advantage to the bacteria in the film. In this study, the ability to form biofilm was measured in a laboratory assay using microtitre plates. C. jejuni strains in monoculture were shown to attach to the abiotic surface and form biofilms to various degrees, thus potentially enhancing their survivability in the poultry environment. C. jejuni was also shown to have the ability to attach and survive in mixed-microbial populations. Biofilm formation may play a role in the epidemiology of C. jejuni infections. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus simulans may play a role in the biofilm formation in the poultry environment as both of these microorganisms were able to form, and harbour C. jejuni in their biofilms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa seemed to inhibit biofilm formation and C. jejuni in the mixed-microbial population. Further studies are required to establish control measures against the formation of biofilms containing C. jejuni in poultry processing plants and farms in New Zealand to reduce the reservoir of contamination and thus reduce the incidence of campylobacteriosis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Campylobacter jejuni</field><field name="subject">biofilm</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/782</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the efficiency of herbicide application to pasture weeds by weed-wiping and spot-spraying : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philososphy in Plant Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moyo, Clyton</field><field name="description">This study investigated methods to reduce herbicide application through improved targeting of weeds, thereby also reducing damage to pastures. The focus was to evaluate and improve wiper and spot-spraying application techniques for pasture herbicides as they reduce chemical use by treating just the weed. Wiper application of herbicides was shown to be a useful technique for controlling Californian thistles. In one trial, a stem reduction of over 90% when assessed 10 months post application was achieved with a double pass of clopyralid, metsulfuron and glyphosate when the plants were treated at the post-flowering stage and were vigorously growing. A double pass was superior to a single pass for glyphosate and triclopyr/picloram, but not for clopyralid and metsulfuron. Subsequent trials produced poor results possibly because of the stressed condition of the thistles and their growth stage as well as lack of consistency in wiper output and operator differences. Despite wiper applicators usually being selective, some damage to pastures was observed in the field, and from a series of experiments it was concluded that rain falling soon after wiper application was the likely cause of pasture damage. An innovative and highly sensitive technique using a spectrophotometer was developed to measure herbicide output from wiper applicators. A spectrophotometer could accurately measure clopyralid concentrations as low as 0.02 g active ingredient in a litre of water. The Eliminator and Rotowiper outputs were found to be highly variable while the Weedswiper was more consistent although it applied less herbicide than the other two wipers. Spot spraying experiments confirmed that glyphosate and metsulfuron create bare patches by damaging both grass and clover while clopyralid and triclopyr/picloram only eliminate clover. However, metsulfuron patches stayed bare for much longer while glyphosate ones quickly filled up with weeds and clover. Ingress of clover stolons appeared to be more important than re-establishment from seed in the recovery of patches. The bigger the damaged patch, the higher the likelihood of recolonisation by opportunistic weeds. Bioassay studies found that over-application of clopyralid and triclopyr/picloram provided residual activity up to 18 and 30 weeks, respectively, thereby potentially preventing re-establishment of white clover. The negative effects on clover seedlings from metsulfuron ranged from 3 to 6 weeks for standard and high rates, respectively, with a stimulatory effect on seedlings thereafter for up to 18 weeks. Dose-response curves for the application of metsulfuron and triclopyr/picloram into the centre 5% versus full plant coverage of Scotch thistle and ragwort rosettes showed that application of herbicide to the centre 5% was as effective at the same concentration and greatly reduced the risk of damage to pasture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbicide application methods</field><field name="subject">pasture weeds</field><field name="subject">wiper application</field><field name="subject">spot spraying</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/779</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-protein-coding-RNA processing in the deep-branching protozoan parasite Giardia intestinalis : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Molecular Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chen, Xiaowei</field><field name="description">[Abstract not supplied]</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giardia intestinalis</field><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">non-coding RNA</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/777</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The new American vortex : explorations of McLuhan : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Ph.D. in Media Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chrystall, Andrew Brian</field><field name="description">To encounter and digest the oeuvre of H. Marshall McLuhan on his own terms, this study deploys a strategy not dissimilar to that of Poe&#8217;s sailor who survived his descent into the maelstrom by studying the action of the vortex and catching hold of a recurring form. Here, McLuhan&#8217;s career-spanning concern with &#8220;communication&#8221; may be seen as just such a recurrence &#8212; his concern with communication is evident at every turn of his effort to update the Great English Vortex of 1914 and develop a second vortex in mid-century America. Having taken hold of this central concern, this study uses the procedure he developed to expose the &#8220;theory of communication&#8221; of any figure in the arts and sciences, and applies it to McLuhan himself. In this process of folding McLuhan in on himself, five loosely chronological chapters are used to reveal the four historical &#8220;phases&#8221; of his career, and to show that McLuhan cannot properly be understood apart from: 1. The great tradition of Ciceronian humanism and the Ciceronian ideal &#8212;the doctus orator &#8212; a figure in whom eloquence and wisdom coalesce. 2. The programme of the figures frequently referred to as the Men of 1914: James Joyce, Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, and Wyndham Lewis. In the final analysis, McLuhan is shown as having updated and transformed both &#8212; the Ciceronian ideal and the programme of the Men of 1914 &#8212; to become something of a singularity in the midst of what he saw as an Electric Renaissance: a paramodern (neither modernist nor post-modernist) doctus orator.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marshall McLuhan</field><field name="subject">theory of communication</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420304 Screen and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/778</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability failure of donor-supported organisational reforms in agricultural extension : a Bangladesh case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Agricultural Extension and Rural Development, Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Islam, Md. Mofakkarul</field><field name="description">For several decades, international donor agencies have provided considerable support for organisational reforms within the agricultural extension system in Bangladesh. This support has been provided through a series of short-term projects that have experimented with a variety of novel extension systems. These have ranged from the centralised training and visit model to decentralised subdistrict based systems to an even more decentralised farmer-led extension system. They have also ranged from an extension system operated by a single government agency to systems run by a partnership between government and non-government organisations. The experimentation has also involved a country-wide or large-scale system to local or small-scale systems. Furthermore, the reforms have varied from a single organisation providing only advisory services to farmers to a constellation of organisations providing a combination of services. However, in virtually every case, when donor support was removed at the completion of a project, the extension reform was found to be unsustainable post-project. Despite the continued failure of donor sponsored extension reforms in Bangladesh, little is formally known as to why such reforms have been unsustainable. Such knowledge is critical if donor-assisted extension reforms in Bangladesh are to be effective and sustainable. Therefore, the overall aim of this study was to determine the reasons why a donor-supported extension reform becomes unsustainable in Bangladesh. From a review of literature, a conceptual framework was developed outlining the conditions/factors under which organisational systems or innovations supported through donor projects do, or do not, become sustainable. Using a qualitative single case study approach, a poorly sustained extension reform supported through a donor project was investigated in depth in Bangladesh. From this investigation, a model that explains the non-sustainability of a donor supported extension reform in Bangladesh was developed. Several theoretically important findings were identified in this study. The extension reform was poorly sustained because the principles underlying the reform lacked cultural legitimacy. This problem was compounded due to the presence of perverse institutional forces in the operational context, and because the extension agencies concerned lacked adequate human and financial resources. The sustainability of the extension reform was also compromised because of poor implementation performance, complex design, parallel modes of project implementation, a failure to develop recipient ownership, and poor capacity to learn and adapt the reform. The mechanisms by which these factors influenced the non-sustainability of the reform are described in detail. The results from this study suggest that the sustainability of donor-supported extension reforms cannot be achieved within the short time frame set out in most projects. Nor can such changes be sustainable unless they are aligned with the norms, values and traditions of extension agencies and rural people. In particular, sustainability will continue to be a serious challenge unless the perverse institutional incentives confronted by extension agencies and rural people are minimised. The donors concerned in Bangladesh should support a locally-owned and single reform idea rather than undertaking haphazard projects with varied ideas, improve inter-donor coordination and come up with a coordinated decision of not providing monetary incentives to extension agencies and rural people, support extension reforms according to the felt needs of recipients, and stop providing aid in the event of repeated failures.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">donor-supported extension reform</field><field name="subject">organisational reform</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">rural development</field><field name="subject">agricultural extension</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360202 Public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/776</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating citizens' agendas in New Zealand local government environmental planning and decision-making : an examination of two wastewater planning processes and implications for deliberative democracy : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Policy at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nash, Simon Joseph</field><field name="description">This research considers the problem of ensuring citizens having meaningful opportunities to provide input in local government environmental planning and decision-making. Planning processes are often as much a product of uncertain human behaviours as they are the result of rational activity and formal institutional arrangements. Both the conduct and outcomes of these processes are heavily influenced by conflicts between actors&#8217; underlying perspectives, yet these perspectives are hard to define and their influence is very poorly understood by researchers. Instead, local government research focuses almost exclusively on institutional arrangements and substantive debates over physical resources. This research focuses on the influence of epistemological and procedural dimensions of actors&#8217; perspectives on the integration of citizens&#8217; agendas in environmental planning and decision-making in New Zealand local government. From a deliberative democratic perspective, I examine obstacles to the conduct of an effective integrative process and consider possible practical and theoretical responses. The research studies two local government wastewater planning processes. It combines Q-methodology with interviews, observation and documentary analysis. This approach allows me to identify actors&#8217; subjective perspectives and to consider their influence on planning and decision-making. This combination of methods has not previously been used in local government research in New Zealand. The research shows that while conflicts between actors&#8217; perspectives pose significant barriers to the integration of citizens&#8217; agendas, they can also offer opportunities for addressing those barriers. Integration is clearly limited by a positivist, rationalist perspective that privileges objectivity in knowledge and planning practices. Integration is further limited by a competitive adversarial perspective. Nevertheless, there is also potential where deliberative perspectives are present that are more value-critical and that seek intersubjective understanding of actors&#8217; inputs. Such compromise-seeking perspectives contribute to more communicatively rational planning and more legitimate and durable decisions. The thesis argues that councils should foster a change among actors towards a more deliberative perspective and should champion such behaviour themselves. Such change is often obstructed by the tacit, unacknowledged, yet persistent, nature of most actors&#8217; perspectives. The thesis concludes that while transformation of perspectives is unrealistic, a more communicatively rational planning approach is achievable as a basis for legitimate decisions that more effectively integrate citizens&#8217; agendas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wastewater</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">citizen participation</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">planning</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/780</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural perceptions of the Wellington landscape 1870 to 1900 : an anthropological interpretation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Christopher Russell</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how cultural perceptions of Wellington&#8217;s environment changed from the 1870s to the early 1900s. The historical material shows how clearing the New Zealand landscape of its forest cover in the early settler years reflected a particular cultural perception of the New Zealand bush. By 1900, this cultural perception had changed indicating that not only was the New Zealand landscape different, but New Zealand society had changed. These changes can be seen in the geographic historical accounts of clearing New Zealand&#8217;s bush and the parliamentary debates of the 1875 Forest Act, 1885 State Forest Act and the 1903 Scenery Protection Act. The anthropological theories of dwelling, taskscape, phenomenology of landscape and the hybridity of nature are used as a contemporary synthesis of ideas to examine cultural perceptions of the Wellington bush. An anthropological approach is also used to bring together diverse historical material in a way that allows these ideas to be applied. Cultural perceptions of the Wellington landscape can be understood in the way the bush was cleared for pasture, how the landscape was depicted in paintings and photography and in the case study of the establishment of Otari-Wilton&#8217;s Bush. The thesis argues that cultural perceptions can be appreciated historically by understanding how people lived within the Wellington landscape, and how this was reflected in attitudes towards the New Zealand bush. Cultural perceptions of New Zealand&#8217;s bush were a combination of existing cultural attitudes, the practicalities of living within the New Zealand environment and a direct perception of the bush itself. It is the shifting influence of all three of these aspects that determines overall cultural perceptions of the bush in any particular period in New Zealand&#8217;s history. The establishment of Otari-Wilton&#8217;s Bush shows how the cultural perception of Wellington&#8217;s bush had changed from seeing it as an obstruction covering potential farmland to having a defined place and purpose within the Wellington landscape.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wellington landscape</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">social anthropology</field><field name="subject">bush clearing</field><field name="subject">Otari-Wilton's Bush</field><field name="subject">attitude change</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/781</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gut endogenous protein flows and postprandial metabolic utilization of dietary amino acids in simple-stomached animals and humans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Deglaire, Amelie</field><field name="description">Dietary protein quality depends on two key measures: true ileal protein digestibility and the metabolic utilization of absorbed amino acids (AA). The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of two dietary factors (antinutritional factors and peptides) on ileal endogenous protein flows; to validate the intubation technique used in humans for ileal digesta sampling; to determine the postprandial metabolic utilization of dietary AA depending on their delivery form and to assess the validity of the growing pig for predicting true ileal protein digestibility in the adult human. Investigations were undertaken in the growing rat, growing pig and adult human. Ileal digesta were collected from euthanised rats, post valve T-caecum cannulated pigs, and naso-ileal intubated conscious adult humans. Ileal endogenous nitrogen (N) and AA were measured using a protein-free (PF) diet, diets containing 15N-labelled casein in the intact (C) or hydrolysed (HC) form, or a diet based on free AA (diet A), for which some dispensable AA were omitted to allow a direct determination of their endogenous flows. Digesta centrifugation and ultrafiltration (diet HC) allowed for the determination of ileal endogenous protein flows and the extent of tracer (15N) recycling. Antinutritional factors from a crude extract of kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), when given at amounts commonly ingested in practice, enhanced ileal endogenous protein flows (rats, PF diet). After adaptation to the diet, body N balance per se did not influence ileal endogenous protein flows (rats, diets PF and A) but dietary peptides led to greater ileal endogenous AA and N flows compared with a protein-free diet. Dietary peptides (HC), compared with peptides naturally released in the gut during protein digestion (C), did not enhance ileal endogenous protein flows (rats, pigs, and humans). The extent of tracer recycling, however, was maximal in frequently-fed rats, lower in meal-fed pigs and minimal in meal-fed humans (65, 21, and 11% of 15N-labelled ileal endogenous proteins, respectively). Naso-ileal intubation for ileal digesta sampling in humans was shown to be an accurate method and evidence was obtained supporting the growing pig as a valid model for predicting true ileal protein digestibility in the adult human. Finally, the form of delivery of dietary AA (from HC or C) influenced the postprandial metabolic fate of dietary AA, especially in terms of AA catabolism kinetics. However, the overall nutritional value of C and HC were similar.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein bioavailability</field><field name="subject">dietary protein</field><field name="subject">ileal endogenous protein flows</field><field name="subject">antinutritional factors</field><field name="subject">peptides</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="subject">pig</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/784</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerated and out-of-season lamb production in New Zealand : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">DeNicolo, Gina</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to evaluate ewe and lamb performance in an accelerated lamb production system, and to compare the performance and lamb output between a conventional and an accelerated lamb production system. In the &#8220;Conventional&#8221; system, ewes were bred in March to lamb in August. The &#8220;Accelerated&#8221; system was based on the &#8220;STAR&#8221; system (Lewis et al., 1996), in which there were five breeding periods within each year. In the current experiment these were 14th January, 28th March, 9th June, 21st August and 2nd November. Progesterone was used to synchronise the breeding periods and during the non-breeding season, eCG was used to induce reproductive activity. Lambing began on each of these dates and weaning was 73 days later, coinciding with the next breeding period. The experiment ran over a three-year period beginning with breeding in March 2003 and was complete with the weaning of lambs from the January 2006-bred ewes. This resulted in 15 lambing and breeding periods over the three years in the Accelerated system and three lambing and breeding periods in the Conventional system. Average pregnancy rates were lower in the Accelerated system than in the Conventional system. Lamb growth rates were similar between the two systems, although lamb live weights at weaning were lower in the Accelerated system due to the age of the lambs at weaning (average = 69 vs 96 days). More lambs were born and weaned, resulting in more kilograms of lamb weaned in the Accelerated system relative to the Conventional system over the experimental period (26,200 vs 24,300 kg). Labour input was 35% higher in the Accelerated system, or 13% higher per lamb weaned. Average annual ewe energy requirements were 6% higher in the Accelerated system. Ewe energy requirements per kilogram of lamb weaned was lower (6%) in the Accelerated system due to more breeding and lambing periods per ewe per year. Laparoscopic observation of ewes&#8217; ovaries at each breeding period revealed that most ewes had active ovaries and were therefore capable of successfully producing a viable foetus. In a subsequent experiment, blood samples were collected for analysis of progesterone concentrations from ewes bred during the spring and autumn breeding periods. Observations of data indicated that a small number of ewes conceived and lost their conceptus, or had abnormal corpora lutea. Results suggested that pregnancies were failing due to a lack of an appropriate signal from the embryo to the dam/uterus. Exposing Romney ewes to an artificial lighting regimen was unsuccessful for inducing reproductive activity during spring. In another experiment, melatonin implants administered to Romney ewes in spring and used in conjunction with eCG and progesterone, resulted in 61% more lambs born per ewe treated, compared to eCG and progesterone alone. This result indicated that melatonin implants, used with eCG and progesterone may be a suitable method for improving reproductive performance in sheep bred out of season in New Zealand. Delaying weaning of lambs and breeding lactating ewes can be used to obtain heavier lamb weaning weights in the Accelerated system. Spring-bred ewes had lambs weaned at either 69 days post partum or 90 days post partum. Reproductive performance was similar between the two groups of ewes, and lamb live weights in the later weaned group were heavier when lambs were 90 and 120 days of age. This research has shown that accelerated or out-of-season lamb production is an option for some New Zealand sheep farmers. However, the mechanisms associated with reproductive seasonality and methods of successfully circumventing this seasonality require further attention in order to achieve optimum reproductive performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lamb production</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">breeding seasons</field><field name="subject">lambing systems</field><field name="subject">accelerated</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/775</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A prospective cohort study of the incidence of injuries among junior Australian football participants over a football season</field><field name="creator">Romiti, Maria Assunta, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: There is currently a lack of investigation of injuries in junior sport, compared to that of adult cohorts. Consequently, very few published studies have demonstrated the incidence of injuries among young participants of Australian football. The aim of this study was to determine the current rate of injury in junior Australian football, and describe the patterns and severity of these injuries across all levels of play, compared to those of McMahon et al. [1]. Methods: The Junior Australian Football Safety Study was completed during 2004 using teams from New South Wales and Victoria across nine levels of play (U9 to U18). Participation and injury data were collected prospectively from all games and training sessions by Primary Data Collectors. The region, nature and cause of injury were collected on injuries that were defined in accordance with a previous 1993 study. Injury severity was identified by the action of players immediately after the injury event. Results: Overall, 40,208 hours of exposure were recorded with an injury rate of 18.0 injuries per 1,000 player hours (95% CI=16.6-19.3). Hand/finger injuries were common among all players. The main causes of injury were body contact (67%), other contact (12%) and game movement (10%). There was an increase in the frequency of sprains and strains, and injury severity with level of play. Of the injuries where the player left the field of play, 63% were able to return to participation. The rates of injury for players who did not continue participation or were advised to seek further medical aid were low. Only 28% of all injured players were advised to seek medical treatment with few injuries taken to hospital (5%). Conclusion: An observed reduction of injury rate in the U15 level of play compared to a similar 1993 study (McMahon et al.), suggests that safe game development at the junior level is likely to have been effective over the past decade. Implications for future skill development include the introduction of incidental body contact skills with further ball-handling skill development in young players, and the introduction of proprioception exercises for players at higher levels of play.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Football injuries</field><field name="subject">Sports injuries in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26145</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"More than a liver" - the role of the social work practitioner in hepatitis C treatment centres</field><field name="creator">Mouton, Marlize, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C is a fast growing infectious disease in Australia and is often associated with related psycho-social and mental health problems.  The conventional treatment process for hepatitis C is challenging due to a number of reasons.  This study explored social workers&#146; perceptions of the contribution of their role in hepatitis C treatment centres in relation to the treatment experience of patients.  The roles that social workers fulfill, their contribution to the multidisciplinary team and towards a culturally competent service, were explored.  Furthermore the knowledge, skills and values required for providing a competent service in a hepatitis C treatment setting was explored.  The broad theoretical frameworks that inform social work practice were considered, especially the biopsycho-social model, the strengths perspective, the critically reflexive approach and communications theory.  This qualitative study used a semi-structured interview method for data collection.  Ten social workers in hepatitis C treatment clinics participated in the study.  The findings highlight the needs of patients and how social worker participants described helping to address and meet these needs by employing their knowledge, skills and values through their social work roles and interventions in a team context in a multicultural and multi-faceted work environment.  A major challenge that social workers described was to keep patients on treatment despite debilitating side effects that diminish patients' motivation to complete treatment.  A shortcoming in the service was described to be the limited psychiatric support available at many treatment centres.  The findings lead to a number of recommendations to improve social work services in hepatitis C treatment settings.  More research was recommended in areas such as motivational techniques, psychiatric support, and effective group work strategies.  The need for increased funding for social work positions in the hepatitis C field was also highlighted.  It is anticipated that findings of this study can be applied to hepatitis C treatment in broader settings such as prisons, drug and alcohol settings and general practice.  This research will contribute to literature in the field of hepatitis C treatment models and in the field of social work practice in hepatitis C contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interferon treatment compliance</field><field name="subject">Social Work</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Treatment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Multi disciplinary team</field><field name="subject">Chronic illness</field><field name="subject">Psycho social assessments</field><field name="subject">Social workers</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Patients</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41466</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glial changes in atypical parkinsonian syndromes</field><field name="creator">Song, Yun Ju Christine, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Idiopathic Parkinson??s disease (PD) and the atypical parkinsonian syndromes progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) have substantial overlap in clinical features, with parkinsonian and cerebellar phenotypes identified. Pathologically, reactive glial changes occur in overlapping pathways in these disorders. Recent findings that glia concentrate proteins associated with genetic forms of PD, suggest a more significant role for these cells in the pathogenesis of these disorders. This study is the first to comparatively assess glial abnormalities in PD, PSP and MSA. Cases were clinically and pathologically characterised to establish correlates to prominent glial changes. The three main types of glia (astrocytes, oligodendroglia and microglia) were characterised by morphological features and protein expression (using immunohistochemical techniques) for correlations with disease indices. Tissue features measured included subregional volumes, nigral cell loss, characteristic disease inclusions, and the densities of glia. Using these techniques, the parkin co-regulated gene protein was found to be a novel constituent protein in protoplasmic astrocytes, facilitating the assessment of glial subtypes.  The data show that distinct glial abnormalities associate with each parkinsonian syndrome. The most marked differences were observed in the astrocytic reaction in each disorder. In PD, protoplasmic astrocytes accumulated non-fibrillar &#61537;-synuclein and degenerated over time, relating to a loss of levodopa responsiveness. In PSP, there was a marked protoplasmic astrogliosis (with these reactive glia strongly expressing parkin) that related to PSP-prominent clinical symptoms. In MSA, there was a marked fibrous astrogliosis and a loss of protoplasmic astrocytes in association with early changes in constituent myelin and oligodendroglial proteins. In contrast, similar microglial activation was observed across all disorders, with phagocytes concentrating in the substantia nigra, while non-phagocytic reactive microglia expressed parkin and associated with inclusion formation in each disorder. Overall, the glial reactions were considered to be either contributing to or ameliorating (neuroprotective) the neurodegenerative processes, and the timing of these reactions assessed with respect to indices of disease progression. The novel findings of this thesis show that glial abnormalities are prominent but distinct, and occur early in these parkinsonian syndromes. Suggestions on how these findings may translate into future therapeutic targets are given.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glia</field><field name="subject">parkinsonism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43314</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patient involvement in diabetes decision-making: theory and measurement</field><field name="creator">Shortus, Timothy Duncan, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Providers are encouraged to view patients with chronic disease as ??partners?? in their care, and to collaborate with them in developing care plans. Yet there is little guidance in how collaboration should occur, and little evidence that collaborative care improves patient outcomes. Related models and measures of patient centred care and shared decision making have not been developed specifically for the context of chronic disease care. This thesis aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of how providers and patients make decisions in chronic disease care planning, how patients experience involvement in care planning, and to develop a measure of patient involvement. It consists of two studies: a qualitative study to develop a grounded theory of decision-making in diabetes care planning, and a scale development and psychometrics study. The qualitative study involved 29 providers and 16 patients with diabetes. It found that providers were concerned with a process described as ??managing patient involvement to do the right thing??, while patients were concerned with ??being involved to make sure care is appropriate??. This led to the theory of ??delivering respectful care??, a grounded theory that integrates provider and patient perspectives by showing how providers and patients can resolve their concerns while achieving mutually acceptable outcomes. Central to this theory is the process of finding common ground, while the key conditions are provider responsiveness and an ongoing, trusting and respectful provider-patient relationship.  The Collaborative Care Planning Scale (CCPS), based on these findings, is a patient self-report scale that measures patients?? perceptions of involvement in care planning. After piloting the CCPS was tested amongst 166 patients with diabetes. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 27-item scale comprising two factors: ??receiving appropriately personalised care?? and ??feeling actively involved in decision-making??. Psychometrics tests revealed the CCPS has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and findings support construct validity.  ??Delivering respectful care?? enriches understanding of the nature of collaboration in chronic disease care, and identifies those elements necessary to ensure patients receive best possible care. The CCPS provides the means for measuring what patients say they value, and is thus an important measure of quality chronic disease care.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shared decision-making</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42153</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of architectural knowledge in managerial decision making: an experimental discrete choice evaluation of the adoption of executional strategies</field><field name="creator">Richard, Pierre Jules, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Managers have responsibility for implementing a firm??s executional strategy.  An executional strategy is the selection of resources and capabilities and the arrangement of them into a supply chain that puts a firm??s espoused positioning into action (Porter, 1985). Executional strategies are selected to maximize economic rents. Firm resources (Barney, 1991) and the arrangement of supply chains (Chandler, 1962; 1990) are important to rent generation. In turn, the potential arrangement of activities into a supply chain is determined by a firm??s depth of architectural knowledge; this is knowledge of how supply chain elements can be linked (Henderson and Clark, 1990). The study provides a simultaneous test of the impact of resources and supply chain arrangements on the selection of executional strategies. The theoretical model is tested through a discrete choice experiment (Louviere et al., 2000). Findings suggest that resources and cost advantages dominate management decision-making with competition also an influence. Importantly, findings for a sub-sample of subjects whose firms are most impacted by Information technology (IT), confirms that architectural knowledge does play a role in the selection of executional strategies. These ??engaged?? subjects were significantly more experienced with the subject matter and more confident about their responses. These engaged subjects utilized architectural knowledge to select strategies that leveraged their resources more widely and to minimize the influence of transaction costs on their strategic choices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architectural knowledge</field><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Modular systems</field><field name="subject">Discrete choice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The generalized continuous wavelet transform  on Hilbert modules</field><field name="creator">Ariyani, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The construction of the generalized continuous wavelet transform (GCWT) on Hilbert spaces is a special case of the coherent state transform construction, where the coherent state system arises as an orbit of an admissible vector under a strongly continuous unitary representation of a locally compact group.

The National Prescribing Service??s Seniors QUM Program was developed in collaboration with consumers to address seniors?? medicines information needs. Seniors are trained as peer educators to convey QUM messages to other seniors in a single group session.  However, there is a dearth of research assessing peer education for seniors about medicines, and little understanding of what peer educators do in practice.  This research investigated how peer educators empower seniors toward the quality use of their medicines.  A participatory action research inquiry was undertaken nationally with organisational leaders and locally with peer educators.  The design was a nested case study with multiple sites, where the Seniors Program was the overarching case containing eight disparate local sites.  The participatory inquiry engaged peer educators from each local site. Qualitative data were collected through participant observation and interviews.  Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and findings were triangulated with other data sources.  Peer educators demonstrated five main functions in the program ?? one primary function within QUM sessions and four support functions outside of sessions. The primary function of facilitating peer learning comprised 10 elements.  A model depicts these elements in the context of varying session conditions and consequences.  Educators?? lived experience as seniors and lay persons was an overarching contributor to peer learning, used strategically through storytelling to assist other elements.  Sharing QUM outside of sessions occurred frequently, but requires development to reach isolated seniors.  Peer educators exceeded expectations in getting QUM messages to seniors, applying unique skills to the information exchange within sessions.  Their status as lay persons tackling the complex topic of QUM reflected an understanding of the disempowerment seniors may feel when seeking information about medicines. Peer educators?? ability to model an active partner role by applying their lived experience through storytelling in an interactive, mutually sharing session challenged seniors to rethink their medicines management and interactions with health professionals.  As the population ages and medicines use increases, understanding and using seniors effectively as educators has great potential.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People over 55 years</field><field name="subject">Peer education</field><field name="subject">Quality use of medicines</field><field name="subject">Participatory action research methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42648</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of morphology on physical properties of reservoir rocks</field><field name="creator">Arns, Christoph Hermann, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">We consider the structural and physical properties of complex model morphologies and microstructures obtained by Xray-CT imaging.  The Minkowski functionals, a family of statistical measures based on the Euler-Poincar&amp;eacute characteristic of n-dimensional space, are shown to be sensitive measures of the morphology of disordered structures. Analytic results for the Boolean model are given and used to devise a reconstruction scheme, which allows one to accurately reconstruct a complex Boolean structure given at any phase fraction for all other phase fractions. The percolation thresholds of either phase are obtained with good accuracy. From the reconstructions one can subsequently predict property curves for the material across all phase fractions from a single 3D image. We illustrate this for transport and mechanical properties of complex Boolean systems and for experimental sandstone samples. By extending the Minkowski functionals to parallel surfaces using operations from mathematical morphology, a powerful discrimination of structure is obtained. Further the sensitivity of the Minkowski functionals under experimental conditions is analysed.  Accurate calculations of conductive and elastic properties directly from tomographic images are achieved by estimating and minimising several sources of numerical error. Simulations of electrical conductivity and linear elastic properties on microtomographic images of Fontainebleau sandstone are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements over a wide range of porosity. The results show the feasibility of combining digitised images with transport and elasticity calculations to accurately predict physical properties of individual material morphologies. We show that measurements of properties based on microtomographic images are more accurate than those based on conventional theories for disordered materials.  We study the elastic behaviour of model clean and cemented sandstones. Results are in excellent agreement with available experimental data, and are compared to conventional theoretical and empirical laws. A new predictive empirical method is given for predicting the elastic moduli of sandstone morphologies.

It has three main but interrelated objectives. Firstly, it establishes the origins, characteristics, dynamics and outcomes of contemporary Irish migration to Australia. Secondly, it explores informants??? multiple experiences of Irishness in both Ireland and Australia. Thirdly, it examines how migrancy and identity issues were related to informants??? sense of belonging and home. Identity is approached in this study from a constructivist perspective. Accordingly, identity is conceptualised as dynamic, subject to situational stimuli and existing in juxtaposition to a constructed ???other???. Prior to migration, a North/South, Protestant/Catholic ???other??? provided the bases for identity constructions in Ireland. The experiences of immigrants from both Northern and Southern Ireland are examined so that the multiple pre- and post-migration experiences of Irishness can be captured. Face-to-face interviews with 203 immigrants provide the study???s primary data. Migration motivation was found to be multifactorial and contained a strong element of adventure. Informal chain migration, based on relationship linkages in Australia, was important in directing flows and meeting immigrants??? post-arrival accommodation needs. Only 28 percent of the sample initially saw their move as permanent and onethird were category jumpers. A consolidation of Irish identity occurred post-migration. This was most pronounced among Northern Protestants and was largely predicated on informants??? perceptions of how Britishness and Irishness were constructed in Australia. For Northern respondents, the freedom to express Irishness may have masked an enforced Irishness that evolved in response to perceived negative constructions of Britishness, and their experiences of homogenisation with Southern immigrants. Hierarchies within white privilege in Australia, based on origin and accent, were indicated by the study findings. Movement and identity were related through the transnational practices of informants. Separation from familial and friendship networks prompted high levels of return visitation and telephone contact with their homeland, establishing the group as a highly transnational in relational terms. Examining the experiences of this invisible immigrant group through a constructionist lens contributed to the broader understanding of whiteness, transnationalism and the Irish diaspora generally.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irish Australia</field><field name="subject">Ireland emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Australia emigration and immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23071</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organisational and communication implications of electronic ordering systems for hospital pathology services</field><field name="creator">Georgiou, Andrew</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hospital Pathology Services</field><field name="subject">Computerised Provider Order Entry (CPOE)</field><field name="subject">Electronic Ordering Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4653</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Porous Silicon Structures for Biomaterial
and Photonic Applications</field><field name="creator">Khung, Yit Lung</field><field name="description">The primary research aim in this thesis is to demonstrate the versatility of porous silicon based
nanomaterials for biomaterial and photonic applications. In chapter 2 of this thesis, the
suitability of porous silicon as a biomaterial was investigated by performing different surface
modifications on the porous silicon films and evaluating biocompatibility of these surfaces in
vitro. The porous silicon surfaces were characteriszed by means of atomic force microscopy
(AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT)
and interferometric reflectance spectroscopy (IRS). Cell attachment and growth was studied
using fluorescence microscopy and cell viability assays. Both fabrication of the porous silicon
films and subsequent surface modifications were demonstrated. Polyethylene glycol
functionalised porous silicon prevented cell attachment, whilst collagen or fetal bovine serum
coating encouraged cell attachment. Surface modifications were also performed on porous
silicon films with different pore sizes and the influence of pore size and surface modification on
primary hepatocyte growth was recorded over a course of 2 weeks by means of laser scanning
confocal microscopy (LSCM), toxicity and metabolic assays. On collagen-coated surfaces with
average pore sizes of 30 nm, multilayer cells stacks were formed. This stacking behaviour was
not observed on samples with smaller pore sizes (10 nm), or in the absence of collagen.
Hepatocytes remained viable and functional (judging by a metabolic assay) for 6 days, after
which they generally underwent apoptosis. Collagen-coated porous silicon films showed later
onset of apoptosis than porous silicon films not coated with collagen or collagen-coated flat
silicon..
In chapter 3 of this thesis, the nitrogen laser of a laser desorption/ionization (LDI) mass
spectrometer was used to selectively ablate regions on porous silicon films that had been
functionalised with a non-fouling polyethylene oxide layer, affording a microscale patterning of
the surface. Surface characterization was performed by means of AFM, SEM, LDI mass
spectrometry, DRIFT and IRS. This approach allowed the confinement of mammalian cell
attachment exclusively on the laser-ablated regions. By using the more intense and focussed
laser of a microdissection microscope, trenches in a porous silicon film were produced of up to
50 micron depth, which allowed the construction of cell multilayers within these trenches,
mimicking the organization of liver cords in vivo. Fluorescent staining and LSCM was used to
study cell multilayer organization.
To gain a better understanding of how surface topography influences cell attachment and
behaviour, porous silicon films were fabricated containing a gradient of pore sizes by means of
asymmetric anodisation (chapter 4). These gradients allowed the investigation of the effect of
subtle changes of pore size on cell behaviour on a single sample. Analysis by means of LSCM
and SEM showed that pore size can dictate cell size and area as well as cell density. In addition,
a region of pore size where cell attachment and proliferation was strongly discouraged was also
identified. This information can prove to be useful for designing non-biofouling surface
topographies.
Using the same asymmetric anodisation setup, photonic mirrors gradients were produced and
overlaid over one another to produce multidirectional lateral photonic mirror gradients that
display a series of roving spectral features (photonic stop-bands) from each gradient layer
(chapter 4). These multidirectional photonic gradients have the potential to serve as optical
barcodes or contributing to the development of graded refractive index devices such as lenses for
high quality image relay and graded-index optical fibers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porous silicon</field><field name="subject">cell micropatterning</field><field name="subject">lateral gradients</field><field name="subject">photonic crystals</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090421.145533</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and Characterisation of Silicide Thin Films for Evaluation of Specific Contact Resistivity of Multi-layered Silicon-based Ohmic Contacts</field><field name="creator">Bhaskaran, Madhu</field><field name="description">Electrical contacts to devices which pose low resistance continue to be of interest as the dimensions of devices decrease and nanotechnology demands better means of creating electrical access. Continued improvement in the performance of ohmic contacts requires techniques to better characterise and quantify the performance of such contacts. In order to study and estimate the resistance of such contacts or the resistance posed by the interface(s) in such contacts, accurate test structures and evaluation techniques need to be used. The resistance posed by an interface is quantified using its specific contact resistivity (SCR), which is denoted using &#131;&#226;c (units: &#163;[cm2). Cross Kelvin resistor (CKR) test structures have been used for the measurement of low values of SCR. A simplified approach to this problem of SCR evaluation (developed previously at RMIT University) using the CKR test structures with varying contact sizes was used and during this work was shown to be  accurate for the estimation of low values (less than10-8 &#163;[cm2) of SCR.      The silicides of interest in this study were titanium silicide (TiSi2) and nickel silicide (NiSi). These thin films are known for their low resistivity and low barrier heights to both n-type and p-type silicon. The research involved thin film formation and substantial materials characterisation of these thin films. The silicide thin films were formed by vacuum annealing metal thin films on silicon substrates. Silicide thin films formed from metal films deposited by DC magnetron sputtering and electron beam evaporation were compared. The composition, crystallographic orientation, and morphology of these thin films were studied using spectroscopy (AES, SIMS, RBS, in situ Raman spectroscopy), diffraction (Bragg-Brentano and glancing angle XRD, RHEED), and microscopy techniques (TEM, SEM, and AFM). TiSi2 and NiSi thin films were also found to be suitable for microsystems fabrication due to their ability to withstand wet etching of silicon using potassium hydroxide.      The SCR of aluminium-titanium silicide ohmic contacts was evaluated to be as low as 6 x 10-10 &#131;&#199;cm2, which is the lowest reported for any two- layer single-interface contact. Characterisation of ohmic contacts comprising of aluminium, nickel silicide, and doped silicon (with shallow implants) were also carried out using the same technique. SCR values as low as 5.0 x 10-9 &#131;&#199;cm2 for contacts to antimony-doped silicon and 3.5 x 10-9 &#163;[cm2 to boron-doped silicon were evaluated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ohmic contacts</field><field name="subject">specific contact resistivity</field><field name="subject">cross Kelvin resistor</field><field name="subject">silicide thin films</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090429.144556</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does the ethnic consumer consider the relevance of the retailer in their decision to buy wine in Christchurch?</field><field name="creator">Li, Shuo</field><field name="description">The value of secondary brand associations has been discussed in the literature for decades. Companies are transferring their brand building to retailers (Bruwer, Li et al. 2002 ), therefore, it is very important to understand the impact of retailers on the product brand and consumers&#8217; decision making processes when considering other relevant sources of brand associations. However, in the wine environment, few published studies have been carried out to examine the association with retailers. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to examine whether this association transfers value to the image of wine brand and influences consumers&#8217; behaviour. Also, the impact of ethnicity on the consumer&#8217;s decision making process will be taken into account. This research specifically provides insight into Christchurch&#8217;s wine retailing industry. Owing to the limited time and resources, the wine drinking community in Christchurch has been divided into two groups (European and Non-European). Europeans (150) and Non-Europeans (50) were recruited for the sample. Two research models and six main hypotheses were established to analyze the relationships between brand associations, perceived brand image and consumer behaviour. Research was conducted to collect quantitative data by using questionnaires, including rating scales and multiple choice questions. Face to face interviews and self-administered methods were employed. Participants were recruited by using a combination of convenience sampling, quota sampling and random sampling. A statistical programme called the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the data. From the results it was found that associations including the packaging, characteristics, quality, country of origin, producer of the wine, retailer or staff qualities have a positive impact on the spending on wine. In particular, the kinds of retailers make differences to consumers&#8217; expected wine budgets. The results also suggested that the evaluation patterns and perceptions of wine are different in the two ethnic groups.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brand associations</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">retailer secondary brand associations</field><field name="subject">brand image</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">consumer decision making</field><field name="subject">consumer evaluation</field><field name="subject">primary brand associations</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1028</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compliance at work: protecting identity and science practice under corporatisation</field><field name="creator">Hunt, Lesley M.</field><field name="description">When the New Zealand Government restructured the system of the public funding of research (1990-1992) it created Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) as companies operating in a global, market-led economy. One CRI, AgResearch, responded to this environment by corporatisation and instituted a normative system of control of workers which, through strategic plans, vision and mission statements, and performance appraisal processes, encouraged workers to adhere to company goals. This thesis, reporting on an ethnographic study of this CRI, shows how most scientific workers (technical workers and scientists alike) experienced insecurity through estrangement because the contributions they wished to make were less valued both in society and in their work organisation. They were excluded from participation in both organisational and Government policy-making, and felt they did not &#8216;belong&#8217; anymore. Scientists in particular were also experiencing alienation (in the Marxist sense), as they were losing autonomy over the production of their work and its end use. Scientific workers developed tactics of compliance in order to resist these experiences and ostensibly comply with organisational goals while maintaining and protecting their self-identities, and making their work meaningful. Meanwhile, to outward appearances, the work of the CRI continued. This thesis adds to the sociology of work literature by extending the understanding of the concepts of compliance and resistance in white-collar work, particularly under normative control, by developing two models of resistance. It adds to the stories of the impact on public sector workers of the restructuring of this sector in New Zealand&#8217;s recent history, and develops implications for science policy and practice.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">science practice</field><field name="subject">restructuring</field><field name="subject">corporatisation</field><field name="subject">normative control</field><field name="subject">AgResearch</field><field name="subject">Crown Research Institute (CRI)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370600 History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine::370602 Sociology and social studies of science and technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate of urine nitrogen applied to peat and mineral soils from grazed pastures</field><field name="creator">Clough, Tim J.</field><field name="description">This study has provided fundamental information on the fate of urine nitrogen (N) when applied to pasture soils. In this work the three pasture soils used were a Bruntwood silt loam (BW), an old well-developed (lime and fertilizer incorporated and farmed for more than 20 years) peat soil (OP) and a young peat (YP) which was less developed (farmed for about 10 years). Initial soil chemical and physical measurements revealed that the peat soils were acidic, had higher cation exchange capacities, had greater carbon:nitrogen ratios and were better buffered against changes in soil pH than the BW soil. However, the BW soil was more fertile with a higher pH. The peat soils had lower bulk densities and higher porosities. Four experiments were performed. In the first experiment &#185;&#8309;N-labelled urine was applied at 500 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; to intact soil cores of the three soils. Treatments imposed were the presence and absence of a water table at two temperatures, 8&#176;C or 23&#176; C, over 11-14 weeks. &#185;&#8309;N budgets were determined. This first experiment showed that the nitrification rate was faster in the BW soil and was retarded with a water table present. Significant leaching of nitrate occurred at 8&#176;C in the BW soil without a water table. This was reduced when a water table was present. Leaching losses of urine-N were lower in the peat soils than in the BW soil. Apparent denitrification losses (i.e. calculated on a total-N recovery basis) ranged from 18 to 48 % of the &#185;&#8309;N-applied with the greatest losses occurring in the peat soils. The second experiment examined denitrification losses, over 30 days, following the application of synthetic urine-N at 420 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; to small soil cores situated in growth cabinets. The effects of temperature (8&#176;C or 18&#176;C) and synthetic urine (presence or absence) were measured on the BW and OP soils. Nitrous oxide (N&#8322;0) measurements were taken from all soil cores and a sub-set of soil cores, at 18&#176;C, had &#185;&#8309;N-labelled synthetic urine-N applied so that &#185;&#8309;N-labelled nitrogen gases could be monitored. This experiment showed that the application of synthetic urine and increased soil temperature enhanced denitrification losses from both soils. Denitrification losses, at 18&#176;C, as &#185;&#8309;N-labelled nitrogen gases accounted for 24 to 39 % of the nitrogen applied. Nitrous oxide comprised less than half of this denitrification loss. Losses of N&#8322;0 in leachate samples from the soil cores accounted for less than 0.1 % of the nitrogen applied. A third experiment, using Iysimeters, was performed over a 150 day period in the field. The six treatments consisted of the 3 soils with applied synthetic urine, with or without a simulated water table; each replicated three times. Lysimeters were installed in the field at ground level and &#185;&#8309;N-labelled synthetic urine-N was applied (500 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;) on June 4 1992 (day 1). Nitrification rates differed between the soils following the trend noticed in the first experiment. As in the first experiment, nitrate was only detected in the leachate from the BW soil and the inclusion of a water table reduced the concentration of nitrate. In the BW soil, the leachate nitrate concentrations exceeded the World Health Organisation's recommended limit (&lt; 10 mg N L-1) regardless of water table treatment. No nitrate was detected in the leachates from the peat soils but there was some leaching of organic-N (&lt; 5 % of N added) in all the peat soil treatments. Denitrification losses were monitored for the first 100 days of the experiment. In the BW soil without a water table, N&#8322;0 production peaked at approximately day 20 and accounted for 3 % of the nitrogen applied. In the peat soils the measured denitrification losses accounted for less than 1 % of the nitrogen applied. Apparent denitrification losses in the peats were, however, calculated to be approximately 50 % of the &#185;&#8309;N-labelled synthetic urine-N applied. It is postulated that the difference between apparent denitrification losses and those measured could have been due to; loss of dinitrogen in leachate, protracted production of dinitrogen below detectable limits, production of denitrification gases after measurements ceased (i.e. days 100 to 150) and entrapment of dinitrogen in soil cores. Due to the apparent denitrification losses being so high, further research into this nitrogen loss pathway was performed. The fourth and final experiment measured denitrification directly using highly enriched (50 atom %) &#185;&#8309;N-labelled synthetic urine-N. It was performed in a growth cabinet held initially at 8&#176;C. The &#185;&#8309;N-labelled synthetic urine was applied at 500 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; to small soil cores of each soil type. Fluxes of N&#8322;0 and &#185;&#8309;N-labelled gases were measured daily for 59 days. On day 42 the temperature of the growth cabinet was increased to 12&#176;C in an attempt to simulate the mean soil temperature at the end of the field experiment. Up to this time, production of nitrogenous gases from the YP soil had been very low. Interpretation of gaseous nitrogen loss in the YP soil was difficult due to the possibility of chemodenitrification occurring. However, in the OP and BW soils, gaseous losses of nitrogen (determined as &#185;&#8309;N-labelled gas) represented 16 and 7 % of the nitrogen applied respectively. Nitrous oxide comprised approximately half of this gaseous nitrogen loss, in both the OP and BW soils. This work implies that urine-N applied to the mineral soil (BW) could potentially threaten the quality of ground water due to nitrate contamination through leaching. In contrast, denitrification appears to be the major loss mechanism from the peat soils, with the production of nitrous oxide being the primary focus for any environmental concern. Future work should examine the fate of the nitrate leached from the BW soil and the potential for dilution, plant uptake or denitrification below a 30 cm soil depth. A better understanding of the denitrification mechanisms could help reduce denitrification and thereby improve the efficiency of nitrogen use and reduce the output of nitrous oxide.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">peat soils</field><field name="subject">pasture soils</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">denitrification</field><field name="subject">nitrate leaching</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300104 Land capability and soil degradation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1030</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flow and sediment movement in stepped channels</field><field name="creator">Whittaker, J. G.</field><field name="description">Laboratory tests were undertaken to establish the formative mechanism for steps and pools in steep mountain streams. They indicated that the formation of steps and pools is associated with high intensity, low return interval events and the processes of armouring/paving and antidune formation. Lower than formative discharges give the structures their step-pool appearance, and under such discharges they are extremely stable. Step-pool streams may be modelled by a succession of artificial steps or weirs. Wooden steps were placed in a laboratory channel for this purpose, and clear water flow, clear water scour, and sediment transport tests undertaken for a range of discharges and channel slopes. Three distinct flow regimes were observed for the clear water flow and clear water scour tests.  They were stable tumbling flow, unstable tumbling flow, and shooting flow. Sediment transport complicated the regimes from low transport rates. Unstable tumbling flow (clear water flow) at a low slope was shown to be caused by the breaking of standing waves at a theoretical maximum of 0.142. For higher slopes (and including clear water scour tests), unstable tumbling flow was shown to be associated with the physical system geometry preventing the submerged hydraulic jump from developing fully. However, unstable tumbling flow was also caused at lower discharges by sediment waves which were a feature of some test runs with sediment transport. Even so, unstable tumbling flow is likely to occur under field conditions only rarely. With clear water scour, the scour dimensions corresponded to the ultimate static limit. That is, no sediment remains suspended by jet action as occurs for the dynamic limit of scour. For clear water flow and clear water scour, resistance to flow may be predicted by logarithmic equations. Resistance to flow with sediment transport correlated strongly with the average scour hole size. A sudden increase in average (and maximum) velocities indicated that with sediment transport, the erosive ability of a step-pool system may increase sharply as pools become drowned by sediment. For a given discharge, increasing the sediment transport rate beyond this drowning led to net deposition, but no real increase in average velocity. With sediment transport, sediment waves and water waves occurred (independently) despite steady inputs of both water and sediment. This behaviour parallels reports of sediment movement as waves in mountain streams. This tendency toward non-uniformity of water and sediment motion suggests that such behaviour may be explicable in terms of recent advances in nonlinear thermodynamics.</field><field name="date">1982</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sediment transport</field><field name="subject">mountain streams</field><field name="subject">stream measurements</field><field name="subject">step-pool systems</field><field name="subject">stream behaviour</field><field name="subject">laboratory modelling</field><field name="subject">hydraulic engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291800 Interdisciplinary Engineering::291801 Fluidisation and fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260500 Hydrology::260502 Surfacewater hydrology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1032</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogenetic affinities, species delimitation and adaptive radiation of New Zealand Ranunculus : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lehnebach, Carlos Adolfo</field><field name="description">Ranunculus is the largest genus in the Ranunculaceae family and comprises c. 600 species. Its distribution is almost worldwide and the largest number of species occurs in temperate zones of North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and in the alpine regions of New Guinea. In New Zealand the genus Ranunculus contains about 41 species and is found both in lowland and alpine environments. This thesis reports a phylogentic analysis of lowland and alpine New Zealand Ranunculus, an assessment of morphological variation and species boundaries among complex alpine species and examines evidence suggesting adaptive radiation of the alpine Ranunculus lineage. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that New Zealand species of Ranunculus are not a  monophyletic group. For some New Zealand species the closest affinities inferred from the analysis of nrDNA and cpDNA sequences are to species from other land masses such as Australia, the Northern Hemisphere, southern South America and islands in the southern Oceans. Contrary to Fisher&#8217;s hypothesis (1965), the Andean South American Ranunculus in the section Trollianthoideae are not closely related to the New Zealand alpine group. The Trollianthoideae section was not monophyletic and the Peruvian-Ecuadorian species in it form a lineage sister to European alpine species. Instead, aquatic and sub-aquatic species from the Euro-Mediterranean region and southern South America and the Kerguelen Island were inferred as the closest relatives to the New Zealand alpine Ranunculus; albeit this relationship was weakly supported. Findings from this study suggest that colonisation of Ranunculus into the Southern Hemisphere has been a dynamic process and several long distance dispersal events and different colonisation routes have been used. Dispersal from New Zealand to Australia and vice versa, has also been inferred. Bird transportation and oceanic currents are speculated as being the most likely vectors for long dispersal for this group. Morphological variability at the species level is a feature of several species of Ranunculus worldwide. In New Zealand, the alpine species R. insignis and R. enysii are characterised by extensive morphological variability across their distribution range. Currently, these two species include a number of geographically restricted forms that in earlier taxonomic treatments were considered as separate species. Analysis of qualitative and quantitative morphological characters using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests and multivariate analysis, habitat characterisation using environmental variables from the GIS database LENZ and molecular analyses of nrDNA and cpDNA sequences have provided a framework for interpreting and understanding the nature of this phenotypic variation. An argument based on morphological, genetic and ecological support for the reinstatement of the species R. insignis, R. lobulatus and R. monroi is presented here. The last two species may correspond to lineages of recent origin. Hybridisation and introgression between R. insignis and R. lobulatus are suggested as being responsible for intermediate phenotypes found in areas where their distribution overlaps. Morphological variability in R. enysii is inferred to have had a complex origin. The species has a disjunct distribution and events of hybridisation and/or introgression with R. monroi and R. gracilipes seems to have occurred in some of the northern and southern populations, respectively. These hybrid lineages may have swamped out pure lineages of R. enysii and eliminated the ancestral phenotype. Studies including assessment of gene flow using microsatellites, phenotypic stability under common garden condition and pollination experiments will be necessary to further test these hypotheses. Contrary to the latter two species, R. lyallii is morphologically uniform across its distribution range but genetically diverse (11 haplotypes, one of them shared with R. buchananii). Morphological stability in this species is probably explained by morphological stasis and habitat specialisation. The alpine Ranunculus group is outstanding in the New Zealand flora in terms of its great phenotypic and ecological diversity of its members. These two features plus the monophyletic nature of the group and its recent origin have suggested to previous researchers that the radiation of this group has been adaptive. Phylogenetic analysis of 20 taxa in this group using nrDNA and cpDNA sequences has shown that the group includes four lineages and that genetic diversity between the species forming each linage is low. This confirms findings from earlier studies by Lockhart et al. (2001). Cluster Analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis and histological and scanning microscopy observations of morphological and anatomical vegetative and reproductive characters were used to quantify the extent of morphological diversity in the group. Habitat diversity of this group was characterised using 16 environmental variables available from the GIS database LENZ and analysed using Canonical variates analysis. Although four habitat types were identified, there was no correlation between habitat and phenotype as predicted for an adaptive radiation. A number of alternative explanations for this lack of correspondence are discussed. The conclusion drawn from this study was that available data layers and resolution of LENZ limit the use of GIS databases for testing hypotheses of adaptation in the New Zealand Alps.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ranunculus</field><field name="subject">New Zealand Alps</field><field name="subject">buttercups</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270401 Plant systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/787</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using substrate analogues to probe the mechanisms of two biosynthetic enzymes : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pietersma, Amy Lorraine</field><field name="description">3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) synthase and 3-deoxy-Dmanno- octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8P) synthase are two enzymes that catalyse very similar reactions. DAH7P synthase is the first enzyme of the shikimate pathway and catalyses the condensation reaction between the four-carbon sugar erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) 1 and the three-carbon sugar phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 2 to give the seven-carbon sugar DAH7P 3. KDO8P synthase catalyses a similar condensation reaction between the five-carbon sugar arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) 8 and PEP 2 to give the eight-carbon sugar KDO8P 9. Early mechanistic studies have shown the reaction mechanisms of these two enzymes to be very similar and structural and phylogenic analysis has suggested that the two enzymes share a common ancestor. However, there are differences between the two enzymes that have not been explained by the current literature. Whereas all DAH7P synthases require a divalent metal ion for activity, there exists both metallo and non-metallo KDO8P synthases. As well as this, there is the difference in substrate specificity. The natural substrate of KDO8P synthase, A5P, is one carbon longer and has the opposite C2 stereochemistry to E4P, the natural substrate of DAH7P synthase. This study investigates the role of the C2 and C3 hydroxyl groups of E4P and A5P in the enzyme catalysed reactions. The E4P analogues 2-deoxyE4P 38 and 3-deoxyE4P 39 have been synthesised from [beta]-hydroxy-[gamma]-butyrolactone and malic acid respectively. The two analogues were tested as substrates for DAH7P synthase from a variety of organisms, including N. meningitidis, the purification and characterisation of which was carried out during the course of these studies. It was found that both analogues were substrates for DAH7P synthase. 2-DeoxyE4P was found to be the best alternative substrate for DAH7P synthase to date. The analogous study was carried out on KDO8P synthase from N. meningitidis with 2- deoxyR5P 34 and 3-deoxyA5P 40. It was found that removal of the C2 and C3 hydroxyl groups of A5P was much more catastrophic for the KDO8P synthase catalysed reaction. Commercially available 2-deoxyR5P was found to be a very poor substrate, whereas 3-deoxyA5P, which was prepared according to a literature procedure was not a substrate. The difference in substrate specificities of DAH7P synthase and KDO8P synthase is consistent with the hypothesis that despite their similarities, these two related enzymes have different mechanisms. The key step for DAH7P synthase appears to be coordination of the E4P carbonyl to the divalent metal. The metal appears to play a less important role in the KDO8P synthase reaction and the key step is the correct orientation of A5P in the active site.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biosynthetic enzymes</field><field name="subject">3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) synthase</field><field name="subject">3-deoxy-Dmanno-octulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8P)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250301 Organic chemical synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/788</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding guest retention : an examination of New Zealand accommodation establishments : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Barnett, Shirley Jean</field><field name="description">Abstract  The importance of customer retention has become a major theme in the literature since the 1990s when empirical studies showed that retaining 5% of customers could lead to an increase in profits ranging from 25% to 85%.  However, customer retention does not appear to have moved from the theoretical into the practical world.  Specifically, there were few empirical studies which focused on customer retention and none were identified in the New Zealand accommodation sector.  The travel and tourism industry contributes approximately 9% to New Zealand&#8217;s GDP, and 10% of all spending by travellers and tourists is in the accommodation sector.  Impacts, such as seasonality, characterise the accommodation sector and many establishments have occupancy rates which can fluctuate from 90% to 30% in the off-season.  With average annual occupancy rates for New Zealand hotels and motels hovering around 55%, retention is a strategy that owners and managers could implement in order to increase occupancy and profits.  In this study the research question was based on a review of the literature and the a priori knowledge and experience of the researcher.  To ensure the research question framing this study was answered in the most exhaustive and comprehensive manner a seven step research process based on work by Bourgeois (1979) was followed.  Data was gathered using both deductive and inductive methods in order to nullify the two main research problems raised by Bourgeois (1979).  First, that theories are cast at a high level which is removed from reality and second that empirical studies often result in just a description of the data.  In the deductive phase of this study a survey was mailed to New Zealand accommodation establishments that provided accommodation and meals, and had a liquor licence.  The main focus of this survey was to learn what owners and managers understood about guest retention and to answer the first research objective.  It was discovered that New Zealand accommodation managers: actively work to retain their guests; know the value of guest retention; understand the links between guest satisfaction, loyalty and retention; understand the specific reasons behind guest defections; understand the importance service recovery; and understand how loyalty schemes lead to guest retention.  The second phase was a case study involving three accommodation establishments.  These findings added depth to the study and allowed for new knowledge to be extrapolated from the findings.  It was discovered that in two establishments the focus was guest satisfaction and building relationships with customers.  Whilst the resort hotel did have a strategy to encourage lapsed business to return this wasn&#8217;t measured or monitored.  Thus the second research objective was answered.  In the penultimate chapter an amended profit chain has been proposed which included &#8216;Building Customer Relationships&#8217; as the link between satisfaction and profitability.  This is based on the finding that the case establishments saw retention as a proxy for satisfaction and, therefore, focused on satisfying guests and building personal relationships as methods of guest retention. The research question framing this study can be answered by saying that the strategies used by owners and managers in New Zealand accommodation establishments to manage guest retention tend to be related to guest satisfaction and building personal relationships.  However, this is not because they do not understand guest retention but see it as part of the bigger picture involving the building of relationships with guests.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guest retention</field><field name="subject">hotel management</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">customer loyalty</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/791</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactive extracts of Olea europaea waste streams : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Mossop, Nicholas Paul</field><field name="description">The production of olive oil has seen an increase in recent years due to a broader understanding of the health benefits of the Mediterranean Aliment Culture. With this expanding industry we also see an increase in the waste products associated with olive oil production. Given the high polluting content of the waste streams and the economic costs associated with its removal and processing, waste remediation and disposal has become a significant point of interest for both producers and local bodies. In this project, wastes of the olive oil production industry are examined for their use as the raw material for a novel product used in the control of horticulturally important diseases, examining the effect of extraction protocols on the activity of the final product. Active fractions of the olive oil wastes were identified from literature and protocols for their extraction and recovery developed; incorporating both standard solvent extraction and novel ultrasound-assisted extraction. Criteria for the analysis of extract quality were outlined and potential target applications identified. The biophenolic compounds of olive wastes were identified as providing the majority of the active fraction, so protocols were developed for the recovery of these compounds. Standard solvent extraction and ultrasound-assisted extraction were examined for their effectiveness of biophenolic recovery and their effect on product quality. Certain horticulturally important diseases were identified as potential targets, and bioassays undertaken to determine the ability of a crude extract to inhibit and control these diseases. It was found that the action of ultrasound during extraction provides a greater degree of recovery of biophenolic compounds, with minimal loss of product quality; as determined by bioassays and total biophenol determination. This increase in recovery is due primarily to the destruction of cellular material resulting in higher rates and absolute yields of recovery. This work provides evidence of the occurrence of some interesting phenomenon in the recovery of biophenols from olive wastes that deserves further examination. The crude olive leaf extract was shown to have an inhibitory effect on bacteria and effectively no inhibitory effect on fungal species in the total biophenol ranges tested. Erwinia amylovora and Staphylococcus aureus both showed a large susceptibility to the olive leaf extract. Results showed a higher degree of susceptibility of Gram positive bacteria and a potential resistance in soil microbes. For bacterial species, total biophenol concentrations of 0.15 to 3.50 mg GAE/ml provided inhibitory effects, while with the fungal species tested, no inhibitory effects were found at total biophenol concentrations of up to 2.50 mg GAE/ml. Some evidence exists that there is an opportunity for the economic recovery of olive biophenols for use as a novel product, but more work is required to determine specific applications and/or targets of use, as well as optimisation of the extraction and purification protocol. A sample removed from interfering compounds will allow the examination of activity of particular compounds and hence a better understanding of the action of the olive waste extract.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">olive oil industry waste</field><field name="subject">extraction of biophenolic compounds</field><field name="subject">solvent extraction</field><field name="subject">ultrasound-assisted extraction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290105 Other industrial biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/789</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling aspects of neurodegeneration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Traini, Mathew, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer??s Disease (AD) and Parkinson??s Disease (PD) are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid beta 1-42 peptide (A&#946;1-42) or &#945;-synuclein, respectively. In both cases, there is extensive evidence to support a central role for these aggregation-prone molecules in the progression of disease pathology. However, the precise mechanisms through which A&#946;1-42 and &#945;-synuclein contribute to neurodegeneration remain unclear. Organismal, cellular and in vitro models are under development to allow elucidation of these mechanisms. A cellular system for the study of intracellular A&#946;1-42 misfolding and localisation was developed, based on expression of an A&#946;1-42-GFP fusion protein in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system relies on the known inverse relationship between GFP fluorescence, and the propensity to misfold of an N-terminal fusion domain. To discover cellular processes that may affect the misfolding and localisation of intracellular A&#946;1-42, the A&#946;1-42-GFP reporter was transformed into the S. cerevisiae genome deletion mutant collection and screened for fluorescence. 94 deletion mutants exhibited increased A&#946;1-42-GFP fluorescence, indicative of altered A&#946;1-42 misfolding. These mutants were involved in a number of cellular processes with suspected relationships to AD, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, chromatin remodelling and phospholipid metabolism. Detailed examination of mutants involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis revealed the potential for phospholipid composition to influence the intracellular aggregation and localisation of A&#946;1-42. In addition, an existing S. cerevisiae model of &#945;-synuclein pathobiology was extended to study the effects of compounds that have been hypothesized to be environmental risk factors leading to increased risk of developing PD. Exposure of cells to aluminium, dieldrin and compounds generating reactive oxygen species enhanced the toxicity of &#945;- synuclein expression, supporting suggested roles for these agents in the onset and development of PD. Expression of &#945;-synuclein-GFP in phosphatidylcholine synthesis mutants identified in the A&#946;1-42-GFP fluorescence screen resulted in dramatic alteration of &#945;-synuclein localisation, indicating a common involvement of phospholipid metabolism and composition in modulating the behaviours of these two aggregation-prone proteins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amyloid beta</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">neurodegeneration</field><field name="subject">alpha synuclein</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43383</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of knitting and preforming parameters on mechanical properties of weft knitted glass/epoxy composites</field><field name="creator">Tran, Luu, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Weft knitted composites have a very complex reinforcement structure which affects their mechanical behaviour.

The knitting and performing parameters were varied but the fibre volume fraction was kept constant within the two groups. In all cases the fibre used was E-glass. After knitting, the fabrics were infused with epoxy resin using a resin transfer moulding (RTM) process.

Harking back to Leibniz in its vision, it imagines a world of interlinked information that computers `understand' and `know' how to process based on its meaning. Spearheaded by the World Wide Web Consortium, ontology languages OWL and RDF form the core of the current technical offerings.  RDF has successfully enabled the construction of virtually unlimited webs of data, whilst OWL gives the ability to express complex relationships between RDF data triples.  However, the formal semantics of these languages limit themselves to that aspect of meaning that can be captured by mechanical inference rules, leaving many open questions as to other aspects of meaning and how they might be made machine processable.  The Semantic Web has faced a number of problems that are addressed by the included publications. Its germination within academia, and logical semantics has seen it struggle to become familiar, accessible and implementable for the general IT population, so an overview of semantic technologies is provided.  Faced with competing `semantic' languages, such as the ISO's Topic Map standards, a method for building ISO-compliant Topic Maps in the OWL DL language has been provided, enabling them to take advantage of the more mature OWL language and tools. Supplementation with rules is needed to deal with many real-world scenarios and this is explored as a practical exercise.  The available syntaxes for OWL have hindered domain experts in ontology building, so a natural language syntax for OWL designed for use by non-logicians is offered and compared with similar offerings.  In recent years, proliferation of ontologies has resulted in far more than are needed in any given domain space, so a mechanism is proposed to facilitate the reuse of existing ontologies by giving contextual information and leveraging social factors to encourage wider adoption of common ontologies and achieve interoperability.  Lastly, the question of meaning is addressed in relation to the need to define one's terms and to ground one's symbols by anchoring them effectively, ultimately providing the foundation for evolving a `Pragmatic Web' of action.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pragmatic web</field><field name="subject">Semantic Web</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Meaning</field><field name="subject">Controlled natural language</field><field name="subject">Topic maps</field><field name="subject">Rule processing</field><field name="subject">Inference</field><field name="subject">Description logic</field><field name="subject">Inference</field><field name="subject">Controlled vocabulary</field><field name="subject">Registry</field><field name="subject">Symbol grounding</field><field name="subject">Semantic technology</field><field name="subject">Semantics</field><field name="subject">Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="subject">Semantic interoperability</field><field name="subject">Cognitive science</field><field name="subject">Definition</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42605</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The two faces of Incan history: Unravelling dual representations in oral traditions of pre-Hispanic Cuzco</field><field name="creator">Yaya, Isabel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the historical traditions and ritual representations of Incan society through the conceptual framework of dual organization. Broadly defined as the division of society into opposed halves, dual organization has been an enduring pattern of social classification in South America. In Pre-Hispanic times, it characterised the social and spatial organization of Cuzco --  the imperial capital of Tawantinsuyu -- which was divided into two asymmetric moieties, Hanan and Urin, composed of several elite factions. Analysis of this system has been hitherto restricted to a branch of ethnohistory informed by structural and cultural anthropology. Very few works have yet investigated the dynamics that linked dualism with the shaping of an historical consciousness proper to the pre-Hispanic ruling elite. The present thesis offers to fill this lacuna in modern scholarship by reassessing Incan narratives in the light of moiety division. In doing so, it identifies the traits proper to two distinctive bodies of Incan traditions, each of which encloses a particular, and mutually conflicting, representation of the past reflecting the moieties' respective perspectives. Such an approach not only harmonizes many discrepancies affecting primary sources on Incan society, but also enables a re-examination of other forms of dualist representation in Incan religion. Three case studies are therefore considered through this methodological approach: the structure of Incan cosmology, the seasonal division of the metropolitan calendar, and the ritual expressions of social antagonisms. The first case study suggests that Incan religion was divided into two sub-cults headed by divinities that were complementary in overseeing water regulation throughout the annual cycle. The second case study shows that the dual division of yearly activities did not coincide sensu stricto with the temporal setting of the Andean meteorological seasons, but rather followed a time framework guided by communal activities and astronomical knowledge. The last case study reveals that the formal model of the conical clan not only clarifies the underlying structure of Incan descent, but also enlightens the triggering mechanisms of Incan succession wars and moiety conflicts. The outcome of this work decolonizes the Andean past by refining our understanding of historical representations in pre-colonial societies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Incan society.</field><field name="subject">Cultural anthropology.</field><field name="subject">Cuzco.</field><field name="subject">Andean.</field><field name="subject">History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43333</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incremental knowledge acquisition for complex multi-agent environments</field><field name="creator">Finlayson, Angela Margaret, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an incremental knowledge acquisition framework that supports the creation of multi-agent teams in complex real-time environments. The underlying technique is based upon the Ripple Down Rules (RDR) technology. RDR is a knowledge acquisition technology that allows the expert to interact directly with the system and construct knowledge incrementally on a case by case basis. RDR and its variants have been successfully applied to a wide range of problem types. However, there has been no research that has explored the adaptation of RDR to complex real-time, multi-agent environments. The domain chosen to develop our system was the Robocup 2D soccer simulation domain. We investigated an SCRDR approach to the problem and from this developed a more complex system based on generalised RDR. This system supported the incremental modelling of intermediate features during the knowledge acquisition process, allowing the experts to create their own abstractions of the domain. The system was extensively evaluated over a period of 6 months, to evaluate the level of performance of the multi-agent teams created by the system and to gather feedback about the usability of the system. During this period of time the system was successfully used by four soccer coaches with differing levels of soccer and computer expertise. All coaches were able to use the system to develop teams that could play at a world class level against the finalists from the Robocup 2007 2D simulation tournament. The approach we present is general enough to be applied to any complex planning problem, with the requirement that a rich feature language is developed to support the specific domain. Our studies confirm that although GRDR seems to be a useful framework for allowing experts to create their own layers of abstractions, in complex domains, some abstractions need to be expressed in low level code below the knowledge level. Our evaluation also suggests that the GRDR system could be improved via further integration with tools to restructure the KB for complex domains where expertise may be experimental and a more radical reorganisation of the KB is required.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42887</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships among afferent neural processing, peristalsis and bolus clearance in the human oesophagus: implications for symptom perception and dysphagia</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chien-Lin, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the relationships among oesophageal motility, bolus clearance and sensory perception of oesophageal stimuli in patients with several dysphagia syndromes were investigated. The work is divided into the following major sections: 1) Current advances in the application of impedance and its utility in distinguishing clearance characteristics between primary and secondary peristalsis; 2) The advances in our understanding of peristaltic motor characteristics, oesophageal bolus clearance and symptom perception in dysphagia syndromes; 3) Peristaltic dysfunction, impaired bolus clearance and symptom perception in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and in patients with globus; 4) TRPV1 expression in oesophageal mucosa in patients with GORD. The main findings from this work are: 1) Secondary peristalsis is less effective as primary peristalsis regarding esophageal transit and clearance of a liquid bolus. 2) In patients with non-obstructive dysphagia (NOD), bolus clearance by both morphologically normal and aberrant secondary peristaltic sequences is impaired. 3) Although, when compared with healthy controls, patients with NOD have a higher prevalence of non-specifically abnormal motor patterns, there is a poor correlation between dysphagia and oesophageal dysmotility. 4) Whereas manometry identified motility abnormalities in one quarter of patients with GORD, impedance demonstrated that the majority of these patients, as well as some patients with normal manometry, had defective bolus clearance. 5) Although patients with erosive GORD have delayed oesophageal bolus clearance, manometric characteristics in these patients are comparable to those seen in non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that abnormal oesophageal bolus clearance may reflect a continuum of dysfunction secondary to increasing oesophageal mucosal damage. 6) Patients with globus are characterized by oesophageal visceral hypersensitivity and aberrant viscerosomatic referral of mechanical and electrical stimuli to the oesophagus. These findings support the hypothesis that oesophageal hypersensitivity with associated viscerosomatic referral patterns are an important pathogenetic mechanism for globus. 7) Patients with erosive GORD exhibit greater gene expression of TRPV1 in oesophageal mucosa when compared with NERD or healthy controls.

When combined with Ohlson??s (1995) linear information dynamics, the accounting version of the Campbell-Shiller model (Campbell and Shiller 1988a, 1988b; Vuolteenaho 2002) implies that if current non-accounting information is more uncertain, then future stock returns are expected to be more volatile. The empirical evidence supports the theoretical predictions, and the results are valid for measures of both systematic and idiosyncratic volatility. Additional analysis yields some evidence that both favourable and unfavourable news from non-accounting information increases future stock return volatility. Overall, the results highlight the value relevance of information in analysts?? forecasts beyond what is contained in the current financial statements.  The second essay extends the theoretical framework of Callen and Segal (2004) and Vuolteenaho (2002) to investigate the association between the uncertainty of accrual information and stock return volatility. The empirical evidence supports the theoretical prediction that the extent of uncertainty in accounting accruals is increasing with the volatility of future stock returns, and the results are valid for measures of both systematic and idiosyncratic volatility. However, when accrual variability is decomposed into fundamental and unexpected portions, I find that the positive relationship between accrual variability and future stock return volatility is dominated by the fundamental component of accrual variability. The findings therefore suggest that the market places little weight on information conveyed by that component of accounting accruals that is most likely to reflect accounting choices, implementation decisions and managerial opportunism.  The final essay argues that the presumed articulation among accruals, cash flows and revenues does not capture decisions on expected accruals when large external financing activities are present. The analysis provides evidence that managers?? ??normal?? operating decisions associated with net external financing activities are likely to lead to measurement errors in unexpected accruals that are part of expected accruals, and erroneous conclusions that significant earnings management exists when in fact there is none. This is especially pertinent in cases where the partitioning variable used to identify instances of earnings management is supposed to be uncorrelated with external financing, when in fact it is correlated. The results underscore the importance of additional specification tests being conducted to control for estimation biases in unexpected accruals associated with external financing. I suggest the use of matched-firm approach using industry and external financing matches in order that reliable and warranted inferences are made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-accounting information</field><field name="subject">Stock return volatility</field><field name="subject">Earnings management</field><field name="subject">Accruals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41521</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive style and adjustment in cochlear implant users</field><field name="creator">Lim, Debbie K., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the role of cognitive factors in adjustment to cochlear implantation.  A cochlear implant is a medical device for severe to profoundly deaf individuals that simulates sound in the cochlea by electrically stimulating the hearing nerve.  The audiological benefits of implantation have shown to be highly variable and difficult to predict.  This has led to the utilisation of psychological factors to predict adjustment.    The aim of this thesis was to develop an understanding of the psychological factors influencing adjustment to implantation within a cognitive framework.  Three studies were conducted that investigated the central hypothesis that individuals with a maladaptive cognitive style are more likely to experience poorer psychological adjustment following implantation.  Study 1 was a cross-sectional survey that aimed to identify the main predictors of post-implant adjustment in a large representative sample of adult cochlear implant recipients.  Participants completed measures of hearing-related cognitions, anxious and depressive symptomatology, emotional reaction to the implant, and hearing-related demographic characteristics.  Psychological adjustment was assessed as stress and coping in relation to hearing impairment.  The tendency to engage more frequently in negative hearing-related cognitions was found to be the strongest predictor of adjustment.  This finding was consistent with the hypothesis that a maladaptive cognitive style plays a key role in determining psychological outcomes following implantation.        Study 2 extended Study 1 by experimentally investigating the impact of a specific maladaptive cognitive process, rumination, on cochlear implant recipients' response to an auditory task.  Based on the Study 1 finding that negative cognitions predicted poorer adjustment, participants engaged in either a positive or negative rumination task.  During rumination, participants focussed on a series of either positive or negative self-statements.  Following rumination, participants completed an auditory (story listening) task.  Participants then rated their mood, extent of negative cognitions, and the perceived difficulty of the auditory task.  Inconsistent with predictions, participants who engaged in negative rumination did not respond more negatively on any of the ratings than participants who engaged in positive rumination.  A correlational analysis, however, showed that greater perceived task difficulty was associated with lower frequency of engagement in positive cognitions about hearing.  Study 3 employed a thought suppression paradigm to investigate in cochlear implant recipients the effects of suppressing thoughts about hearing difficulty during an auditory task.  It was predicted that participants instructed to suppress would experience an increased frequency of target thoughts and greater negative mood, both during and after suppression.  During the first (baseline) experimental period, both suppression and non-suppression participants monitored their thoughts by pressing a button when they experienced a thought about hearing difficulty.  In the second (suppression) period, suppression participants suppressed their thoughts about hearing difficulty.  In the third (post-suppression) period, suppression participants were instructed to no longer suppress their thoughts.  Participants who suppressed had an increased frequency of target thoughts subsequent to, but not during, suppression.  There were no differences between suppression and non-suppression participants for mood, either during or after suppression.  The finding of a delayed increase in target thoughts indicated that attempting to suppress thoughts about hearing difficulty may be a maladaptive cognitive strategy for managing unwanted negative cognitions about hearing in cochlear implant recipients.  In concluding, the thesis proposes a cognitive model of adjustment to cochlear implantation that synthesises the findings of the studies conducted and takes into account the cognitive theories that informed the program of research.  The major components of this model include the tendency to engage in negative hearing-related cognitions, the maladaptive cognitive processes employed to manage negative hearing-related cognitions, and cognitive load factors.  While far from conclusive, the model presents an initial framework within which the current findings can be understood and further hypotheses generated.  Methodologically, the model also provides an empirically informed framework for future investigations into the cognitive factors associated with adjustment in cochlear implant users.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cochlear implants</field><field name="subject">Cognitive styles.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21897</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of murine cytomegalovirus infection on haematopoiesis and myeloid cell differentiation and function</field><field name="creator">Khong, Andrea</field><field name="description">Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen affecting over 95% of the world&#146;s population. While infection is typically asymptomatic in healthy individuals, the virus persists life-long in its host and can be reactivated following withdrawal of immune control. As such, it remains a serious clinical concern in individuals who are immunocompromised, such as newborns and neonates, transplant and/or chemotherapy recipients, and HIV/AIDS patients. CMV also has the ability to cause immunosuppression, the mechanisms of which include defective antigen presentation to T cells and interference with haematopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM). Due to strict species specificity, murine CMV (MCMV) provides a relevant model for the study of CMV modulation of the immune system in vivo in its natural host. The type I interferons (IFNs) represent a major family of cytokines involved in the early response to MCMV infection. Their anti-viral activity and regulation of NK cell activation and cytotoxicity are of significant interest in the context of MCMV infection, as genetic resistance to MCMV is mediated by the ability of Ly49H+ NK cells to directly recognise and lyse infected cells. Chapter 2 comprises an analysis of acute MCMV infection in the absence of type I IFN activity. These studies were conducted in IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 deficient mice, which lack components of the type I IFN receptor. Data obtained from these studies confirmed the essential requirement for type I IFN in controlling viral titres, promoting expansion of splenic Ly49H+ NK cells, and inducing early activation of NK cell cytotoxicity. In addition, our data depicted an accumulation of infected myeloid cells in the absence of effective NK cell-mediated control. This was paralleled by a significant increase in the level of serum TNF-a and IFN-&#191;, an effect which in some cases has been linked to serious pathological disease. Thus, the data described in this chapter provide an insight into the consequences arising from delayed NK cell responses to MCMV infection in the absence of type I IFN. vii Type I IFN can also potentially affect BM haematopoiesis. BM atrophy and impairment of myelopoiesis are serious consequences of CMV infection. During acute MCMV infection we consistently observed a profound loss of splenic dendritic cells (DCs) in BALB/c mice. Since all DC subsets are derived from BM haematopoietic progenitor cells, the possibility that MCMV might interfere with BM haematopoiesis and DC differentiation was explored. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the impact of acute MCMV infection on BM progenitors, with particular emphasis on the differentiation capabilities of these cells in ex vivo culture systems. Chapter 3 focuses on the effect of MCMV infection on BM cellularity and frequency of specific BM progenitor populations. A thorough analysis of contributing factors, such as viral infection of BM cells, involvement of type I and II IFNs, progenitor cell trafficking and NK cell activity in the BM compartment, was conducted. Our results showed that a severe loss of BM cellularity occurs in MCMV-infected mice. Furthermore, when BM cells from MCMV-infected mice were cultured ex vivo in granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), there was an impairment in their ability to differentiate into DCs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytomegalovirus infections</field><field name="subject">Cytomegaloviruses</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells</field><field name="subject">Hematopoiesis</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Molecular  aspects</field><field name="subject">Immunosuppressive agents</field><field name="subject">Interferon</field><field name="subject">Tumour model</field><field name="subject">Cytokine response</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells</field><field name="subject">Murine cytomegalovirus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0260</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical mechanisms involved in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in malignant mesothelioma cells</field><field name="creator">Cregan, Inez Lidia</field><field name="description">Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive malignancy that originates from mesothelial cells and is highly resistant to conventional forms of anti-cancer therapy. Defects in apoptotic pathways are believed to play a major role in determining resistance to chemotherapy. The characterization of these pathways in mesothelioma is essential in order to develop more effective therapies. The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are a family of proteins that regulate apoptosis and have been implicated in the resistance of malignant cells. There is evidence that upregulation of specific IAP molecules can influence tumour progression and response to chemotherapy. In this study we examined the apoptotic signalling in MM cells and the potential role of IAPs in both cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. We examined expression of six IAP genes or isoforms in both malignant and normal mesothelial cells. Results demonstrated that XIAP, IAP-1, IAP-2, survivin and Bruce were expressed in all four MM cell lines and four primary mesothelial cultures. There was no evidence for differential expression of these genes between MM and mesothelial cultures. Livin expression was detected in only one MM cell line. Various aspects of apoptotic signalling pathways in response to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin were also analysed including: a) the mitochondrial integrity, b) caspase activation, c) cell viability and d) phosphatidylserine translocation. In order to further characterize the role of IAPs, the transcriptional regulation of these genes in response to cisplatin was investigated using real-time RT-PCR. The results of these experiments indicated that there was no significant regulation of IAPs at the transcriptional level in the cells examined during cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Overall the data was consistent with cisplatin inducing apoptosis in MM cells via intrinsic signalling pathways in a dose dependent manner. Regulation of IAP expression was not seen at the RNA transcription level as has been described in other tumour types but may occur through protein posttranslational events.  In order to further investigate IAP function we performed analyses of two IAPs which had previously been proposed as having a role in mesothelioma: XIAP and survivin. Protocols for RNAi knockdown at the protein expression level were established. Although the data indicated significant reduction in protein expression, the effects on cell survival after treatment with cisplatin were moderate. These studies were then extended to other molecules that are known to interact with and modulate the function of IAPs. We characterized the expression of the proteins: XAF1, HTRA2, ARTS in MM cells. RT-PCR data showed that HTRA2 and XAF1 genes were expressed in MM cell lines, however we did not see expression of ARTS.   On the basis of recently published data we examined the XAF1 splice variants expressed in MM cell lines by sequence determination and PCR screening.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mesothelioma -- Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Cisplatin</field><field name="subject">Malignant mesothelioma</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0033</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some synthetic carbohydrate chemistry : natural product synthesis, rational inhibitor design and the development of a new reagent</field><field name="creator">Goddard-Borger, Ethan D</field><field name="description">Earnest carbohydrate research was initiated in the nineteenth century by several talented organic chemists. Carbohydrates, now known to play essential roles in a range of fundamental biological processes, are presently studied by a throng of scientists from many fields, including: biochemistry, molecular biology, immunology, structural biology, medicine, agriculture, pharmacology and, of course, chemistry. Organic chemistry remains as relevant to carbohydrate research as it has ever been; its practitioners, with their skills in synthesis and fundamental understanding of molecules, are truly indispensable. This thesis details various synthetic endeavours within the field of carbohydrate chemistry. It describes four projects with goals as diverse as natural product synthesis, rational inhibitor design and the development of new reagents in organic synthesis. The first chapter provides an account of the synthesis of compound 1, a potent germination stimulant present in smoke, from D-xylose. Many analogues of 1 were prepared from carbohydrates and evaluated as germination stimulants, which permitted the dissemination of several structure-activity relationships. Subsequent chapters describe the design and preparation of inhibitors for various carbohydrate-processing enzymes. Compounds 55 and 56 were sought after as putative synergistic inhibitors of a Vitis vinifera (grape) uridine diphospho-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (VvGT1). It was hoped that crystallographic investigations of VvGT1-UDP-2/3 complexes by a collaborator, structural biologist Professor Gideon Davies, would aid in clarifying mechanistic aspects of this enzyme.Compounds 114, 115 and 118 were prepared as putative arabinanase inhibitors. Once again, this work was undertaken to assist in crystallographic studies that might provide a better understanding of how these enzymes operate. The thesis concludes by describing the development of compound 152.HCl, a novel reagent for the diazotransfer reaction. Previously, this reaction utilised trifluoromethanesulfonyl azide (TfN3), an expensive and explosive liquid with a poor shelf-life, to convert a primary amine directly into an azide. Reagent 152.HCl was developed to replace TfN3 in this useful synthetic transformation. A one-pot procedure enabled the simple and inexpensive preparation of 152.HCl, which was demonstrated to be shelf-stable, crystalline and, crucially, effective in the diazotransfer reaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbohydrates</field><field name="subject">Chemical reactions</field><field name="subject">Chemical tests and reagents</field><field name="subject">Natural products -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Organic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Carbohydrate chemistry</field><field name="subject">Rational inhibitor design</field><field name="subject">Germination stimulant</field><field name="subject">Diazotransfer reaction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0043</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random finite sets in Multi-object filtering</field><field name="creator">Vo, Ba Tuong</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The multi-object filtering problem is a logical and fundamental generalization of the ubiquitous single-object vector filtering problem. Multi-object filtering essentially concerns the joint detection and estimation of the unknown and time-varying number of objects present, and the dynamic state of each of these objects, given a sequence of observation sets. This problem is intrinsically challenging because, given an observation set, there is no knowledge of which object generated which measurement, if any, and the detected measurements are indistinguishable from false alarms. Multi-object filtering poses significant technical challenges, and is indeed an established area of research, with many applications in both military and commercial realms. The new and emerging approach to multi-object filtering is based on the formal theory of random finite sets, and is a natural, elegant and rigorous framework for the theory of multiobject filtering, originally proposed by Mahler. In contrast to traditional approaches, the random finite set framework is completely free of explicit data associations. The random finite set framework is adopted in this dissertation as the basis for a principled and comprehensive study of multi-object filtering. The premise of this framework is that the collection of object states and measurements at any time are treated namely as random finite sets. A random finite set is simply a finite-set-valued random variable, i.e. a random variable which is random in both the number of elements and the values of the elements themselves. Consequently, formulating the multiobject filtering problem using random finite set models precisely encapsulates the essence of the multi-object filtering problem, and enables the development of principled solutions therein.  '...' The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in simulated scenarios, and shown at least in simulation to dramatically outperform traditional single-object filtering in clutter approaches. The second key contribution is a mathematically principled derivation and practical implementation of a novel algorithm for multi-object Bayesian filtering, based on moment approximations to the posterior density of the random finite set state. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated in practical scenarios, and shown to considerably outperform traditional multi-object filtering approaches. The third key contribution is a mathematically principled derivation and practical implementation of a novel algorithm for multi-object Bayesian filtering, based on functional approximations to the posterior density of the random finite set state. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the previous, and shown to appreciably outperform the previous in certain classes of situations. The final key contribution is the definition of a consistent and efficiently computable metric for multi-object performance evaluation. It is shown that the finite set theoretic state space formulation permits a mathematically rigorous and physically intuitive construct for measuring the estimation error of a multi-object filter, in the form of a metric. This metric is used to evaluate and compare the multi-object filtering algorithms developed in this dissertation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Random sets</field><field name="subject">Point processes</field><field name="subject">Bayesian methods</field><field name="subject">Bayesian statistical decision theory</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Stochastic processes</field><field name="subject">Automatic tracking</field><field name="subject">Bayesian estimation</field><field name="subject">Multi-target tracking</field><field name="subject">Multi-object filtering</field><field name="subject">Miss distance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0045</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blue laser for precision spectroscopy : toward optical frequency standard referenced to laser cooled calcium atoms</field><field name="creator">Grishina, Vera</field><field name="description">Optical frequency standards with the reference to a narrow electronic transition of a laser-cooled collection of neutral atomic particles are becoming essential tools of research in modern precision physics experiments. In the core of a building block of an optical frequency standard is the optical continuous wave laser that has a good spectral purity of the emitted light. Such a stable optical oscillator is highly desirable in high resolution spectroscopy, if it emits in a good quality beam at a short visible wavelength. This Master thesis explores efficient techniques for building such an optical frequency source intended for use in the cooling and trapping of Calcium atoms scheme. The strong dipole transition at the blue wavelength in the atomic Calcium is needed to reduce the kinetic energy of atoms by nearly six orders of magnitude. A further reduction in the thermal energy of the laser cooled atoms is required to locate with ultra-high precision the 400 Hz narrow clock transition of the stable 40Ca isotope. The experimental methods that achieve this and approach sub-microkelvin temperature of the laser cooled bosonic isotopes of alkaline earths are inspected. The blue laser with a uniform intensity distribution in the beam is useful to maintain the trapped number of cold atoms during these experiments. The spectroscopic properties of the relative transitions in Calcium atom are also reviewed following relevant publications in the area. The constructed blue laser can be used as a primary wavelength source in the lasers network for cooling and trapping of Calcium atoms. These experiments will constitute part of the project to build an optical atom clock referenced to 40Ca narrow linewidth transition. The blue laser is constructed by generating second harmonic in a Potassium Niobate crystal, which is temperature controlled to use a type-I noncritical phase-matching of the optical nonlinear process. The power of the intracavity-generated second harmonic depends on the resonance properties of the optical resonator where this nonlinear crystal is placed. The study is aimed at characterising the designed optical resonator and the experimental parameters that describe it. The formula is derived that relates the resonance power enhancement coefficient with  finesse and the power coupling contrast of a passive optical cavity. The obtained relationship is verfied during the experiments. The produced efficiency of the intracavity second harmonic generation is approx. 0.0023 mWblue/(mWred)2. The research work also examines the noise characteristics of the infrared diode laser that is used as a pump source for the intracavity generated second harmonic and determines the spectroscopic precision of the produced blue light. The frequency locking experiment is analysed using the unbalanced scheme of the polarisation stabilisation technique. The designed optical buildup cavity became a part of the unbalanced frequency discriminator in such a scheme. The results demonstrate high gain of frequency noise suppression of the stabilised laser. The unbalanced arrangement of the H}ansch-Couillaud technique has been possible due to a very low amplitude noise of semiconductor lasers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Frequency standards</field><field name="subject">Frequency stability</field><field name="subject">Laser cooling</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor lasers</field><field name="subject">Laser spectroscopy</field><field name="subject">Optical frequency standard</field><field name="subject">Calcium atom</field><field name="subject">Frequency stabilisation</field><field name="subject">Intracavity second harmonic generation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0046</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A modelling study into the effects of rainfall variability and vegetation patterns on surface runoff for semi-arid landscapes</field><field name="creator">Hearman, Amy</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Generally hydrologic and ecologic models operate on arbitrary time and space scales, selected by the model developer or user based on the availability of field data. In reality rainfall is highly variable not only annually, seasonally and monthly but also the intensities within a rainfall event and infiltration properties on semi-arid hillslopes can also be highly variable as a result of discontinuous vegetation cover that form mosaics of areas with vegetation and areas of bare soil. This thesis is directed at improving our understanding of the impacts of the temporal representation of rainfall and spatial heterogeneity on model predictions of hydrologic thresholds and surface runoff coefficients on semi-arid landscapes at the point and hillslope scales. We firstly quantified within storm rainfall variability across a climate gradient in Western Australia by parameterizing the bounded random cascade rainfall model with one minute rainfall from 15 locations across Western Australia. This study revealed that rainfall activity generated in the tropics had more within storm variability and a larger proportion of the storm events received the majority of rain in the first half of the event. Rainfall generated from fontal activity in the south was less variable and more evenly distributed throughout the event. Parameters from the rainfall analysis were then used as inputs into a conceptual point scale surface runoff model to investigate the sensitivity of point scale surface runoff thresholds to the resolution of rainfall inputs. This study related maximum infiltration capacities to average storm intensities (k*) and showed where model predictions of infiltration excess were most sensitive to rainfall resolution (ln k* = 0.4) and where using time averaged rainfall data can lead to an under prediction of infiltration excess and an over prediction of the amount of water entering the soil (ln k* &gt; 2). For soils susceptible to both infiltration excess and saturation excess, total runoff sensitivity was scaled by relating drainage coefficients to average storm intensities (g*) and parameter ranges where predicted runoff was dominated by infiltration excess or saturation excess depending on the resolution of rainfall data were determined (ln g* &lt;2). The sensitivity of surface runoff predictions and the influence of specific within storm properties were then analysed on the hillslope scale. '...'   It was found that using the flow model we still get threshold behaviour in surface runoff. Where conditions produce slow surface runoff velocities, spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity influences hillslope surface runoff amounts. Where conditions create higher surface runoff velocities, the temporal structure of within storm intensities has a larger influence on runoff amounts than spatial heterogeneity. Our results show that a general understanding of the prevailing rainfall conditions and the soil's infiltration capacity can help in deciding whether high rainfall resolutions (below 1 h) are required for accurate surface runoff predictions. The results of this study can be considered a contribution to understanding the way within storm properties effect the processes on the hillslope under a range of overall storm, slope and infiltration conditions as well as an improved understanding of how different vegetation patterns function to trap runoff at different total vegetation covers and rainfall intensities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arid regions ecology</field><field name="subject">Hydrologic cycle</field><field name="subject">Hydrologic models -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Runoff -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0047</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The virtuoso performer-composer: Brigid Burke's contribution to the clarinet repertoire</field><field name="creator">Smith, Katherine Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis takes as its broad area of study the solo instrumental music produced since 1960 by the virtuoso performer-composer, and focuses on the works of Australian clarinettist and composer Brigid Burke.

Its range encompasses much of southern Australia; however, much of it has been cleared for agriculture. Malleefowl are thought to have suffered substantial decline owing to multiple threats that include habitat loss, predation from exotic predators, grazing of habitat by introduced herbivores and fire - common threats in the decline of many Australian vertebrate species. The malleefowl has an unmistakeable appearance, unique biology, and widespread distribution across Australia. Consequently, it has been the focus of much scientific and community interest. In the Western Australian wheatbelt, community groups are working to conserve the species and have been actively collecting data on its distribution for over 15 years. The vast majority of these data are presence-only and have been collected in an opportunistic manner but, combined with long-term data from government agencies and museums spanning over 150 years, they present a significant opportunity to inform ecological questions relevant to the conservation of the species. The purpose of this study was to answer key ecological questions regarding the distribution, status and habitat preferences of malleefowl using unstructured occurrence records supplemented by reliable absences derived from Bird Atlas data sets and targeted surveys. Malleefowl in the Western Australian wheatbelt were used as a case study to illustrate: 1) how the decline of a species can be quantified and causes of that decline identified; and 2) how threats can be identified and responses to threats explored. I used bioclimatic modelling to define and explore variation within the climatic niche of the Malleefowl across Australia. '...' This thesis provides substantial additional knowledge about the ecology, distribution and status of malleefowl in Western Australia. It also illustrates how opportunistic and unstructured data can be augmented to investigate key aspects of a species' ecology. Despite the limitations of these data, which primarily relate to variation in observer effort across time and space, they can provide important outcomes that may not be achieved using standard survey and data collection techniques. The utility of opportunistic data is greatest in situations where the species: is recognisable and easily observed; is relatively sedentary; and occurs within a landscape containing consistent land use and habitat types. The approaches used in this study could be applied by researchers to situations where community interest exists for species with these attributes. At a national scale, the malleefowl is predicted to decline by at least 20% over the next three generations. The findings of this thesis suggest that the future for the species in the Western Australian wheatbelt may not be as dire as predicted elsewhere within its range, owing largely to the easing and cessation of threatening processes (e.g. land clearing, grazing of habitat by livestock) and the ability of the species to occupy a variety of habitat types. Despite this perceived security, some caution must be exercised until there is a more complete knowledge of the impact of fox predation and reduced rainfall due to climate change on malleefowl populations. Furthermore, the status of the species beyond the agricultural landscapes in Western Australia requires closer examination.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology -- Statistical methods</field><field name="subject">Endangered species -- Western Australia -- Wheatbelt Region</field><field name="subject">Malleefowl</field><field name="subject">Spatial analysis (Statistics)</field><field name="subject">Malleefowl</field><field name="subject">Species distribution</field><field name="subject">Decline</field><field name="subject">Threatening processes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0050</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiovascular protective effects of dietary polyphenols</field><field name="creator">Loke, Wai Mun</field><field name="description">Polyphenols are naturally-occurring phytochemicals, which form an integral part of the human diet. Results from epidemiological studies have associated polyphenol intake with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases. Previous human intervention studies suggested that dietary polyphenols exert their cardioprotective effects through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. While most in vitro experiments have not accounted for the bioavailability and metabolism of these polyphenols, our work has provided direct evidence, using quercetin, that metabolic transformation, together with bioavailability, exert profound effects on bioactivity. We examined the effect of quercetin and its major metabolites on the production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids by human leukocytes. Studies comparing free radical scavenging, antioxidant activity and eicosanoid production demonstrate that there are different structural requirements for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. We also investigated the effect of metabolic transformation on flavonoid bioactivity by comparing the activity of quercetin and its major metabolites to inhibit inflammatory eicosanoid production from human leukocytes. Quercetin was a potent inhibitor of leukotriene B4 formation in leukocytes (IC50 ~ 2&#181;M), and its activity was dependent on specific structural features, particularly the 2,3 double bond of the C ring. Functionalisation of the 3'-OH group with either methyl or sulfate reduced inhibitory activity up to 50% while a glucuronide substituent at the 3-OH effectively removed the leukotriene B4 inhibitory activity. The major quercetin metabolite quercetin-3'-O-sulfate retained considerable lipoxygenase inhibitory activity (IC50 ~ 7 &#181;M) while quercetin-3-O-glucuronide maintained antioxidant activity but had no lipoxygenase inhibitory activity at physiologically relevant concentrations. We conclude that structural modification of quercetin due to metabolic transformation had a profound effect on bioactivity, and that the structural features required for antioxidant activity of 8 quercetin and related flavonoids were unrelated to those required for inhibition of inflammatory eicosanoids.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases -- Diet therapy</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Dietary polyphenols</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Oxidative stress</field><field name="subject">Endothelial dysfunction</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0051</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are attention bias and interpretation bias reflections of a single common mechanism or multiple independent mechanisms?</field><field name="creator">Fitzgerald, Marilyn</field><field name="description">There is abundant evidence of anxiety-linked threat-biased attention and anxiety-linked threat-biased interpretation (cf. Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1994, 2005). The present research aimed to determine whether these cognitive biases reflect a single common underlying mechanism (the Common Mechanism Account) or multiple independent underlying mechanisms (the Independent Mechanisms Account). To address this question, a battery of eight experimental tasks was developed; four tasks measured attention bias and four measured interpretation bias. Participants with different levels of trait anxiety, completed pairs of these tasks. The pattern of associations amongst all eight tasks was compared with the pattern of associations between the four tasks that measured attention bias and the pattern of associations between the four tasks that measured interpretation bias. Both Accounts predicted strong associations between the four tasks that measured attention bias, and between the four tasks that measured interpretation bias. However, the Common Mechanism Account predicted generally strong associations between all of the eight tasks, that were equivalent in strength to the associations between tasks measuring attention bias and to the associations between tasks measuring interpretation bias. In contrast, the Independent Mechanisms Account predicted weaker associations between all of the eight tasks than the associations either between the tasks measuring attention bias or between the tasks measuring interpretation bias. The obtained pattern of associations between internally reliable measures of anxiety-linked attention bias and anxiety-linked interpretation bias failed to support the Common Mechanism Account, but rather was consistent with the predictions of the Independent Mechanisms Account.

Compatibility of these devices with their surroundings is becoming increasingly difficult as a modern PCB can have hundreds or thousands of parts, operating on many layers, and all at high speed. One such part is a via and its clearance, or via hole, commonly required in multilayer circuits where vertical connections between layers are used. The via hole may be exposed to large electromagnetic fields within the PCB. Although electrically small, the via hole provides a pathway for the fields to excite the exterior, either directly or through coupling to adjacent structures. To quantify this process, the near fields and radiation of an excited via hole are analysed, and are the focus of this thesis. The near fields of the via hole are first decoupled into electric and magnetic fields of the 'static' type. In both cases a series solution for two regions, one outside, and one inside the layers is constructed. The coefficients of the terms of the series are chosen to best satisfy the boundary behaviour of the fields on the conducting surfaces and across the hole. The criteria for assessing quality of the solution is based on the least squares method (LSM). Linear equation systems for both models are derived, and as no numerical integration or discretisation is required, an efficient and robust implementation to find the near fields is developed. Transformation into the far field is then achieved through surface integration of relevant field quantities close to the via hole. The far fields are best viewed as that due to two dipoles, of the magnetic and electric type, with strength and orientation depending on how the via hole is excited. It is shown that the two dipole model is sufficient to find the radiation from a 1mm diameter via hole at a frequency up to 8 GHz. Of further interest is how the choice of via hole dimensions affects the dipole moments and the near fields solved earlier are a key to this understanding.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electromagnetic compatibility</field><field name="subject">Electronic circuit design</field><field name="subject">Printed circuits</field><field name="subject">Printed circuit board radiation</field><field name="subject">Via holes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0053</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tectonostratigraphic analysis of the Proterozoic Kangdian iron oxide - copper province, South-West China</field><field name="creator">Greentree, Matthew Richard</field><field name="description">The Cenozoic Ailaoshan &#150; Red River shear zone marks the present day western margin of the South China Block. Along this margin are well preserved late Paleoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic sedimentary and volcanic successions. This work examines the ages and tectonic environments for the formation of the successions, as well as significance of the regional tectono-magmatic events on the formation of widespread iron oxide-copper deposits. The oldest succession is the Paleoproterozoic Dahongshan Group. A new SHRIMP UPb age of 1675 &#177; 8 Ma for a tuffaceous schist unit confirms its Paleoproterozoic age. Detrital zircon ages of the Dahongshan Group range between Archean to Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2780 &#150; 1860 Ma). They include a population of ca. 2400 &#150; 2100 Ma grains, which have no known source region on the exposed Yangtze Block. Previous geochemical studies of metavolcanic rocks from the Dahongshan Group have suggested that these rocks were erupted in an oceanic setting. However, this study shows that the metavolcanics are extremely altered and cannot be used for reliable tectonic discrimination. Based on the characteristics of sedimentary rocks in the Dahongshan Group, it is suggested that these rocks were deposited in a continental setting. Overlying the Dahongshan Group is a thick sedimentary sequence which has been variably termed the Kunyang, Dongchuan, Huili or Xide Groups. In the past, these rocks have been considered as a Mesoproterozoic rift succession. However, no precise age constraints were available for the succession. In this study, this sequence is found to contain at least two separate tectonostratigraphic units. The oldest (ca.1140 Ma) is comprised of alkaline basalt with a geochemical and isotopic character similar to that of modern intracontinental rift basalts. The presence of Cathaysia-derived sediments in this unit indicates sedimentary transportation from the southerly Cathaysia Block to the northerly Yangtze Block (in present coordinates) in South China at that time, which suggests an &#147;impactogen&#148; scenario. The thick sedimentary sequence of what has traditionally been defined as the Kunyang Group has been found to have significantly younger depositional age of ca.1000 &#150; 960 Ma. The composition of sedimentary rocks and the provenance of detrital zircons from the Kunyang Group are consistent with a foreland basin setting. The depositional age of this sequence coincides with the timing of Sibao Orogeny as determined elsewhere in the South China Block. Summary Page ii Numerous iron oxide - copper (gold) deposits occur within the rocks of the Dahongshan and Kunyang Groups. Previous studies have classified these deposits into two deposit styles: the Dahongshan-type Paleoproterozoic VMS mineralisation hosted within the Dahongshan Group, and the Dongchuan-type diagenetic carbonate and shale-hosted deposits hosted within the Kunyang Group. However, both deposit types share similarities with the iron oxide &#150; copper (gold) deposit class, such as stratabound disseminated and massive copper ores, abundance of iron oxide occurring mostly as low Ti - magnetite and haematite, and variable enrichments in Au, Ag, Co, F, Mo, P and REE. 40Ar/39Ar data from both deposit types indicate mineralisation ages of ca. 850 &#150; 830 Ma and 780 &#150; 740 Ma.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geological time</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">Iron oxides -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">Copper ores -- China, Southwest</field><field name="subject">South China block</field><field name="subject">Geochronology</field><field name="subject">Tectonics</field><field name="subject">Mesoproterozoic</field><field name="subject">Paleoproterozoic</field><field name="subject">Rodinia</field><field name="subject">Copper mineral deposits</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0054</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coordination of power system controllers for optimal damping of electromechanical oscillations</field><field name="creator">Gianto, Rudy</field><field name="description">This thesis is devoted to the development of new approaches for control coordination of PSSs (power system stabilisers) and FACTS (flexible alternating current transmission system) devices for achieving and enhancing small-disturbance stability in multi-machine power systems. The key objectives of the research reported in the thesis are, through optimal control coordination of PSSs and/or FACTS devices, those of maintaining satisfactory power oscillation damping and secure system operation when the power system is subject to persisting disturbances in the form of load demand fluctuations and switching control. Although occurring less frequently, fault disturbances are also considered in the assessment of the control coordination performance. Based on the constrained optimisation method in which the eigenvalue-based objective function is minimised to identify the optimal parameters of power system damping controllers, the thesis first develops a procedure for designing the control coordination of PSSs and FACTS devices controllers. The eigenvalue-eigenvector equations associated with the selected electromechanical modes form a set of equality constraints in the optimisation. The key advance of the procedure is that there is no need for any special software system for eigenvalue calculations, and the use of sparse Jacobian matrix for forming the eigenvalue-eigenvector equations leads to the sparsity formulation which is essential for large power systems. Inequality constraints include those for imposing bounds on the controller parameters. Constraints which guarantee that the modes are distinct ones are derived and incorporated in the control coordination formulation, using the property that eigenvectors associated with distinct modes are linearly independent. The robustness of the controllers is achieved very directly through extending the sets of equality constraints and inequality constraints in relation to selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with the state matrices of power systems with loading conditions and/or network configurations different from that of the base case. On recognising that the fixed-parameter controllers, even when designed with optimal control coordination, have an inherent limitation which precludes optimal system damping for each and every possible system operating condition, the second part of ii the research has a focus on adaptive control techniques and their applications to power system controllers. In this context, the thesis reports the development of a new design procedure for online control coordination which leads to adaptive PSSs and/or supplementary damping controllers (SDCs) of FACTS devices for enhancing the stability of the electromechanical modes in a multi-machine power system. The controller parameters are adaptive to the changes in system operating condition and/or configuration. Central to the design is the use of a neural network synthesised to give in its output layer the optimal controller parameters adaptive to system operating condition and configuration. A novel feature of the neural adaptive controller is that of representing the system configuration by a reduced nodal impedance matrix which is input to the neural network.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power system stability</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Control</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Optimal control coordination</field><field name="subject">Neural adaptive controller</field><field name="subject">PSS and FACTS devices</field><field name="subject">Small-disturbance stability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0056</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing the borders: A critical approach to cross cultural social work education.</field><field name="creator">Costello, Susan</field><field name="description">This PhD by project outlines research conducted in 2007 on the Thai Burma border, introducing social work education to Burmese health and community workers. In addition to experiencing physical and social upheaval, workers have little access to general education or training in relation to their work with refugees and displaced people.   A request from the director of a Refugee Health Clinic to provide social work education for local workers led to my research question: How do I develop and teach a culturally relevant, cross cultural, sustainable social work curriculum for Burmese health and community workers on the Thai Burma border?    The project consists of a product: three manuals of curriculum developed on the border and written for use by future visitors or locally trained workers, and an exegesis: an exploration of the research, methodology and a detailed analysis of my product in the context of the literature. The exegesis is organised around three main themes.   First is the intersection of social work education and international social work, with a critique of colonialist impositions of Western social work in developing Asian countries. This section considers what constitutes relevant social work and social work education in this context.    The second theme examines the researcher's attempts to suspend her assumptions and create a learning exchange through culturally sensitive social relationships that acknowledge and scrutinize power relations within the Burma border context.      The final theme raises questions of critical pedagogy. Key differences in beliefs about educational purpose and approaches can be identified between Asia and the Western world. The project employed adult learning principles and explored the challenges of teaching critical thinking.    Based on a participatory action research model, the curriculum design process attempted to be collaborative, inclusive and recursive. As a corollary, the project created a community of practice that continues to meet and work together towards social justice for migrants on the border, concepts that were not known to the participants prior to the training program.    The project aimed to connect international social work education to social work's core missions of emancipation, human rights and activism on the Thai Burma border. The themes are transferable to other sites of social work in the Asia-Pacific region where social development precedes the practice and teaching of social work.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International social work</field><field name="subject">participatory action research</field><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">curriculum development</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090501.102211</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stakeholder Participation and Corporate Social Responsibility: A Critical Study of Problem Gambling in the New South Wales Registered Club Sector</field><field name="creator">Fallon, Wayne John</field><field name="description">Within the context of</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate social responsibility</field><field name="subject">Critical approach to stakeholder theory</field><field name="subject">Action research</field><field name="subject">Learning history approach</field><field name="subject">Registered clubs</field><field name="subject">Poker machines</field><field name="subject">Problem gambling</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090501.161849</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residual concentrations and persistence of the anticoagulant rodenticides brodifacoum and diphacinone in fauna</field><field name="creator">Fisher, P. M.</field><field name="description">Brodifacoum is a highly effective anticoagulant rodenticide that presents a secondary hazard to some non-target wildlife. The high acute toxicity of brodifacoum to mammals and birds, and its prolonged persistence in liver predicates secondary risk to predators and scavengers of poisoned rodents. Hence there is a need to improve ability to monitor and predict hazards of brodifacoum to non-targets, and optimise use patterns accordingly. Use of a less persistent anticoagulant rodenticide, diphacinone, is an alternative approach currently under investigation in New Zealand. This thesis describes a series of laboratory and pen studies that address information gaps relevant to the assessment of non-target hazards in continued use of brodifacoum, and of using diphacinone as an alternative. Non-lethal techniques for determining sublethal brodifacoum exposure in birds was investigated in chickens. Elevation of prothrombin time was a less reliable index than residual concentrations in tissues. Samples requiring less invasive procedures, such as dried blood spots or faeces, have potential to detect recent sublethal brodifacoum exposure and refinement of these indices could be useful in proactive monitoring of avian wildlife. Residual brodifacoum in eggs of sublethally-exposed hens raised further questions regarding wider non-target hazard and adverse effects on development of fertile eggs or chicks. A laboratory trial with rats found a positive correlation between residual brodifacoum concentrations in liver and the amount of brodifacoum ingested as bait. An estimated 14-22% of ingested brodifacoum was excreted in rat faeces in the period between ingestion of a lethal dose and death, indicating another potentially significant environmental pathway for brodifacoum transfer. In considering diphacinone as a less persistent alternative rodenticide to brodifacoum, evaluation of residual concentrations and persistence in pig tissues was required to estimate secondary hazard to human consumers and adequate with-holding periods for hunting feral pigs in areas where diphacinone was applied. A pen trial showed that domestic pigs were more susceptible to diphacinone toxicity, and thus primary poisoning risk, than previously estimated. Hepatic half-life of diphacinone in pigs was approximately 14 days, indicating reduced persistence in comparison to brodifacoum and enabling estimates of with-holding periods for hunting feral pigs from areas where diphacinone baits were applied. To investigate potential hazards of diphacinone use to invertebrates a trial using tree weta, a native New Zealand invertebrate, was undertaken. Weta readily ate diphacinone wax block baits with no mortality or weight loss evident, indicating low susceptibility. Residual whole-body diphacinone concentrations did not increase with the amount of diphacinone bait eaten. A simple, deterministic risk assessment suggested that, as a single secondary exposure, the maximum diphacinone concentration measured in weta would present a low risk to non-target birds. Given international recognition of the high secondary hazard and corresponding restrictions on use of brodifacoum, continued availability of brodifacoum to non-licensed users and sustained field applications for possum and rodent control in New Zealand is an exceptional use pattern. New data in this thesis suggest that baiting strategies that minimise the amount of brodifacoum available in the environment are important and regulatory review of some New Zealand brodifacoum applications should address this. In parallel, development of diphacinone as an alternative to brodifacoum should continue, as new data here confirms lower persistence in mammalian liver than brodifacoum, and also indicates low toxicity to invertebrates. However further investigation of multiple-exposure hazard and potential sublethal effects of diphacinone on non-target mammals and birds is warranted before extensive and sustained field applications of diphacinone are undertaken.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anticoagulant</field><field name="subject">brodifacoum</field><field name="subject">diphacinone</field><field name="subject">elimination half-life</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">non-target wildlife</field><field name="subject">pigs</field><field name="subject">residues</field><field name="subject">rodents</field><field name="subject">rodenticide</field><field name="subject">secondary poisoning</field><field name="subject">sublethal effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::309900 Other Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/930</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applied ecology of the Tasmanian lacewing Micromus tasmaniae Walker (Neuroptera : Hemerodiidae)</field><field name="creator">Leathwick, D. M.</field><field name="description">The Tasmanian lacewing (Micromus tasmaniae Walker) is one of the most common aphid predators occurring in lucerne crops in New Zealand. A comparison of sampling techniques, and the output from a simulation model, suggest that the abundance of this lacewing may have been significantly underestimated in the past. Although the occurrence of aphid predators was erratic M. tasmaniae occurred more often and in far greater numbers (up to 100 m&#8315;&#178;) than any other predator species. A simulation model for lacewing development in the field indicated that the large adult populations which occurred could be accounted for on the basis of reproductive recruitment. Independent evidence that immigration was not involved in the occurrence of these large populations was gathered using directional flight traps around the field perimeter. The major factors influencing lacewing population dynamics were the availability of aphid prey and, in the autumn, parasitism. Otherwise, survival of all life-histoty stages was high with no evidence of egg or larval cannibalism. Several instances of high lacewing mortality were identified by the model and the lack of any obvious cause for these highlights inadequacies in the understanding of lacewing bionomics. The model, which used a linear relationship (day-degrees) between development and temperature, was incapable of accurately predicting lacewing emergence under field temperatures which fluctuated outside the linear region of the development rate curve. Temperature thresholds and thermal requirements estimated under fluctuating temperatures similar to those in the field produced almost identical model output to those estimated under constant temperatures in the laboratory. Prey species was capable of influencing the rate of lacewing development. M. tasmaniae has the attributes necessary to produce large populations in the short time available between lucerne harvests. The asymptote of the functional response curve is low but the efficiency at converting aphids to eggs is high. Therefore, the lacewing is able to attain maximun reproductive output at low prey densities. A low temperature threshold for development (4-5&#176; C), rapid development and short preoviposition period results in a short generation time (49 days at 15&#176; C). Long adult life, high fecundity and the absence of any form of estivation or diapause, results in complete overlap of generations and multiple generations per year. M. tasmaniae's role as an aphid predator is restricted by its low appetite for prey and by the lucerne management regime currently practiced in New Zealand. Because it consumes relatively few aphids per day the lacewing's ability to destroy large aphid populations is limited. However, this may be offset by its ability to attack aphids early in the aphid population growth phase, and by the large numbers of lacewings which may occur. Under the present lucerne management schemes the large lacewing populations which do occur are forced out of the fields, or die, following harvest. A number of management options for increasing the lacewings impact as an aphid predator are briefly discussed.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae Walker</field><field name="subject">lacewings</field><field name="subject">lucerne</field><field name="subject">aphid predators</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">pest management</field><field name="subject">Hemerobiidae</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270706 Life histories (incl. population ecology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1044</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of floral resources on the leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) parasitoid Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Cameron)(Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in selected New Zealand vineyards</field><field name="creator">Berndt, Lisa A.</field><field name="description">In this study, buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.)) flowers were used to examine the effect of floral resources on the efficacy of the leafroller parasitoid Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Cameron) in vineyards. This was done by assessing the influence of these flowers on parasitoid abundance and parasitism rate, and by investigating the consequences of this for leafroller abundance. In laboratory experiments, alyssum flowers were used to investigate the effect of floral food on the longevity, fecundity and sex ratio of D. tasmanica. Dolichogenidea tasmanica comprised more than 95 % of parasitoids reared from field collected leafrollers in this study. The abundance of D. tasmanica during the 1999-2000 growing season was very low compared with previous studies, possibly due to the very low abundance of its leafroller hosts during the experiment. The number of males of this species on yellow sticky traps was increased (although not significantly) when buckwheat flowers were planted in a Marlborough vineyard; however, the number of female D. tasmanica on traps was no greater with flowers than without. The abundance of another leafroller parasitoid, Glyptapanteles demeter (Wilkinson)(Hymenoptera: Braconidae), on traps was also not significantly affected by the presence of buckwheat flowers, although females of this species were caught in greater numbers in the control than in buckwheat plots. Naturally-occurring leafrollers were collected from three vineyard sites in Marlborough, and one in Canterbury during the 2000-2001 season to assess the effect of buckwheat and alyssum flowers on parasitism rate. Parasitism rate more than doubled in the presence of buckwheat at one of the Marlborough vineyards, but alyssum had no effect on parasitism rate in Canterbury. A leafroller release/recover method, used when naturally-occurring leafrollers were too scarce to collect, was unable to detect any effect of buckwheat or alyssum on parasitism rate. Mean parasitism rates of approximately 20 % were common in Marlborough, although rates ranged from 0 % to 45 % across the three vineyard sites in that region. In Canterbury in April, mean parasitism rates were approximately 40 % (Chapter 4). Rates were higher on upper canopy leaves (40-60 %) compared with lower canopy leaves and bunches (0-25 %). Leafroller abundance was apparently not affected by the presence of buckwheat in Marlborough, or alyssum in Canterbury. Buckwheat did, however, significantly reduce the amount of leafroller evidence (webbed leafroller feeding sites on leaves or in bunches) in Marlborough, suggesting that the presence of these flowers may reduce leafroller populations. Leafrollers infested less than 0.1 % of Cabernet Sauvignon leaves throughout the 1999-2000 growing season, but increased in abundance in bunches to infest a maximum of 0.5 % of bunches in late March in Marlborough. In Pinot Noir vines in the 2000-2001 season, leafroller abundance was also low, although sampling was not conducted late in the season when abundance reaches a peak. In Riesling vines in Canterbury, between 1.5 % and 2.5 % of bunches were infested with leafrollers in April. In the laboratory, alyssum flowers significantly increased the longevity and lifetime fecundity of D. tasmanica compared with a no-flower treatment. However, daily fecundity was not increased by the availability of food, suggesting that the greater lifetime fecundity was related to increases in longevity. Parasitoids were also able to obtain nutrients from whitefly honeydew, which resulted in similar longevity and daily fecundity to those when alyssum flowers were present. The availability of food had a significant effect on the offspring sex ratio of D. tasmanica. Parasitoids reared from naturally-occurring leafrollers produced an equal sex ratio, assumed to be the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for this species. In the laboratory, this ESS was observed only when parasitoids had access to alyssum flowers. Without food, or with honeydew only, sex ratios were strongly male-biased. In the field, floral resources affected the sex ratio of D. tasmanica only when this species was reared from leafrollers released and recovered in Marlborough. In that experiment, buckwheat shifted the sex ratio in favour of female production from the equal sex ratio found in control plots. No firm explanations can be given to account for these results, due to a lack of research in this area. Possible mechanisms for the changes in sex ratio with flowers are discussed. This study demonstrated that flowers are an important source of nutrients for D. tasmanica, influencing the longevity, fecundity and offspring sex ratio of this species. However, only some of the field experiments were able to show any positive effect of the provision of floral resources on parasitoid abundance or parasitism rate. More information is needed on the role these parasitoids, and other natural enemies, play in regulating leafroller populations in New Zealand vineyards, and on how they use floral resources in the field, before recommendations can be made regarding the adoption of this technology by growers.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dolichogenidea tasmanica</field><field name="subject">Braconidae</field><field name="subject">parasitoid</field><field name="subject">leafroller</field><field name="subject">Tortricidae</field><field name="subject">vineyard</field><field name="subject">habitat manipulation</field><field name="subject">floral resources</field><field name="subject">buckwheat</field><field name="subject">alyssum</field><field name="subject">longevity</field><field name="subject">fecundity</field><field name="subject">sex ratio</field><field name="subject">nectar</field><field name="subject">flower</field><field name="subject">conservation biological control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270703 Terrestrial ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300204 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1045</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wine tourism experiences in New Zealand: an exploratory study</field><field name="creator">Alonso, Abel Duarte</field><field name="description">Recently, New Zealand's wine industry has made remarkable progress. For example, the number of hectares planted in grapes increased from 4,880 in 1990, to 15,479 in 2003, and the number of wineries increased from 175 in 1993 to 421 in 2003. Projections for 2006 indicate that the growth of wine exports should nearly double from 2003, with expected revenues of $NZ 736 million. However, despite this growth, little has been reported about developments in New Zealand's wine tourism industry, or about consumer perceptions of the winery experience in the form of published academic research. The limited amount of information, particularly from the visitors' points of view, may not only be preventing winery operators and the wine industry in general from having a better understanding of their visitors, but also from addressing the needs of different visitor segments. Resulting implications for winery operators may include forgone business opportunities, and customers not fully benefiting in terms of product and service quality. Recent studies indicate that this last element is particularly important in wine tourism. This study reports the results of an exploratory research project conducted in New Zealand wineries that investigated aspects of the winery experience, including wine involvement, satisfaction with the winery experience, and visitor demographics. An index to measure involvement with wine, the wine involvement index (WIX), was developed and utilised to investigate whether wine involvement had an impact on winery visitors' behaviour. Data were collected from winery visitors via questionnaires distributed in a sample of wineries in different wine regions of New Zealand. A total of 609 usable responses were obtained (24.8% response rate). The results indicate a number of differences between the independent, dependent, and moderating variables. For example, it was found that age, whether visitors are domestic or international, and different levels of wine involvement appear to have a clear impact on winery expenditure. In addition, the WIX was confirmed to be a useful tool, for example, by identifying potential relationships between different groups of winery visitors. The results add new knowledge to the area of wine tourism, and offer useful information for wineries and the wine tourism industry. This information includes the potential commercial significance of some visitor groups. An additional contribution of this study is the 'complete wine tourism research model.' This concept presents an alternative to existing wine tourism models, and points out attributes and dimensions that play a major role in the winery experience.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine</field><field name="subject">wine tourism</field><field name="subject">winery visitors</field><field name="subject">visitor segmentation</field><field name="subject">satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Wine Involvement Index (WIX)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1046</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is there an appropriate model of community wind turbine ownership for New Zealand? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Jane Louise Mary</field><field name="description">Historically, public ownership of telecommunications, railways, ports, and energy, amongst other infrastructure, has been important in New Zealand. In the electricity sector local authorities generated and supplied electricity from the early 1900s. Thus in a sense electricity generation was in the hands of community owned and operated trading enterprises. However, the reforms of the 1980s and 1990s brought significant restructuring of this infrastructure based on the market model of privatisation. Since 1992 energy companies have been required to operate as successful businesses despite being ultimately owned by community trusts which, in effect, hold the assets of the energy company in trust for the community. However, it is arguable as to whether this model actually pursues social and community objectives. Community ownership of wind turbines is common in some European countries, but there are currently no examples of this form of ownership in New Zealand. This thesis defines community ownership and by examining case studies in Scotland, Denmark and Australia, proposes a model of community ownership appropriate to wind turbine ownership in New Zealand. Specifically, this thesis seeks to identify community ownership models that are capable of promoting holistic environmental justice by reconciling social justice with ecological justice. A number of forms of community ownership are identified in the various case study countries and a comparative analysis is carried out of these exemplars. On the basis of these studies it is found to be possible for a form of community ownership of wind turbines to exist in New Zealand that incorporates both social justice and ecological justice principles as holistic environmental justice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind turbines</field><field name="subject">community ownership</field><field name="subject">electricity</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">public ownership</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/798</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expectations, emerging issues and change for Chinese international students in a New Zealand university : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Skyrme, Gillian Ray</field><field name="description">This study uses a sociocultural framework to trace the experiences of 24 Chinese international undergraduate students studying business and information sciences in a New Zealand university, using community of practice perspectives recognising the university as a site of complex discourses requiring negotiation of new identities and practices. The students&#8217; expectations, the issues that emerged and the processes of change they went through to meet their goals were investigated from retrospective and longitudinal viewpoints, using semi-structured interviews supported by schematic representations developed by the researcher and photographic representations compiled by participants were. The findings suggest that preparation before departure focused largely on expected English demands, rather than wider matters of academic culture, and this was only partially rectified during prior study in New Zealand. Students thus entered the university unfamiliar with its specific discourses and found conditions for resolving difficulties more limited than previously experienced. The anonymity and extreme time pressure pertaining in large first-year classes led to bewilderment about requirements, threats to the sense of identity as competent students which they had arrived with, and often, failure of courses. Nevertheless, the investment, personal and monetary, which this journey represented provided the incentive to persevere. Most students were resourceful in negotiating a fit between their learning preferences and the affordances of the university, resulting in very different journeys for each of them. Measures adopted included those sanctioned by the university, such as developing skills to meet the demands of academic literacies, and others less valued, such as extreme dependence on teacher consultation. Success was gained through personal agency which proved more important than the university goal of student autonomy. Beyond the academic arena, other activities such as part-time jobs were significant in contributing to a sense of identity as competent and educated adults, and to new viewpoints which contrasted with original cultural norms. They continued to identify as Chinese, but in a &#8220;third space&#8221; owing something to New Zealand influences. The study concludes that entry criteria should include a component of university preparation. It also recommends measures by which the university might enhance the experiences of such students.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese international students</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">cultural</field><field name="subject">sociocultural</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/793</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generic electric propulsion drive : a thesis in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Engineering in Mechatronics at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edmondson, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">Considerable resources worldwide are invested in the research and development of future transportation technology. The foreseen direction and therefore research of future personalised transportation is focused on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or hybrid combinations that use hydrogen fuel cells. These new transport energy systems are consider most to replace the current vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine (ICE). The research work presented in this thesis mainly focuses on the development of a software control system for future BEV prototype vehicles - a generic intelligent control system (GICS). The system design adopts a modular design concept and intelligent control. The whole system consists of four modules being communication, power supply, motor driver and transmission module. Each module uses a microcontroller as the brain and builds an embedded control system within the module. The control and communication between the modules is based on a group of specific parameters and the status of a state machine. In order to effectively implement intelligent control and simplify the system structure and programming, a generic intelligent fuzzy logic model that can be configured to a specific application with a near real-time buffered communication methodology is developed. The tests made on the fuzzy control model and the near real-time buffered communication gave a very positive outcome. The implementation of the fuzzy control and the communication methodology in each of the modules results in a communication between the modules with a steady speed, better reliability and system stability. These modules link together through the communication channels and form a multi-agent collaborative system (MACS). As the controllers are designed based on the parametric concept, the system is able to be implemented to future new modules and therefore allow prototype vehicle control systems to be developed more efficiently. The MACS is based on the core components of the control system - fuzzy logic controller (FLC), Serial Communication and Analogue input control software modules. Further work is carried out as an attempt to integrate the control software with a hardware design for a generic electric propulsion drive (GEPD). This thesis therefore outlines the design and considerations in software and hardware integration in addition to the GICS. The output from this thesis being the construction of soft programming modules for embedded microcontroller based control system has been accepted and presented at two international conferences; one in Wellington, New Zealand[1] the second in Acireale, Italy[2].</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electric propulsion drive</field><field name="subject">mechatronics</field><field name="subject">Battery Electric Vehicles</field><field name="subject">software control system</field><field name="subject">generic intelligent fuzzy logic model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290400 Automotive Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/797</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adding quality to the quilt : adolescent experiences of critical incident responses in secondary schools in Aotearoa New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University (Palmerston North campus), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Kathryn Janet</field><field name="description">Critical incidents impact on populations that experience them. Within secondary schools in Aotearoa New Zealand, there is an expectation that a response is made to schools that experience such incidents. There is much conflicting international research as to the efficacy of these responses. The adult experts are making decisions that they believe are in the best possible interests of the young people; they are putting together a quilt that they believe will nurture young people. The expertise and knowledge of a major stakeholder &#8211; the young people involved in the critical incident response &#8211; has been for the most part, omitted from research. This particular study set out to gather data about young people&#8217;s experiences of critical incident responses, so that the quilt being provided has input from this group and so is able to better meet their needs. The study had four major facets. It incorporated reflections on my intrinsic involvement in this field of practice and was, therefore, heuristic. Secondly, qualitative research was utilised to explore with young people their stories about what happened for them at the time of an incident. Thirdly, it incorporated principles of participatory research as an acknowledgement that young people are central stakeholders in secondary schools and that their voice was one that needed to be heard in order that the best responses may be offered. Lastly, it was utilisation focused. It was designed so that the findings were not just written up and filed away but disseminated to those who make decisions at the school level and policy level. At the analysis stage, two major methods were used. Firstly, inductive analysis was used to identify the themes that emerged from the interviews with the young people. Triangulation was then used to consolidate these themes using the input from Collaborative Groups and a systematic review of the knowledge that I have gained over the time that I have been involved with young people in the critical incident response area. This analysis of the contribution from the young people resulted in several areas being highlighted. Firstly, participants asked that those responding to critical incidents considered the use of language and the power of words, Secondly, they believed that schools needed to act proactively and to have a plan and, in association with this, that they develop a culture that better cared for the needs of young people. Thirdly, the young people involved requested that the &#8216;right&#8217; people responded at the time of an incident: the qualities of the &#8216;right&#8217; people and the &#8216;wrong&#8217; people were also identified. Next, the young people were well able to identify the positives that could ensue out of negative situations, and lastly, they expressed their wish that there be a place for their involvement at the time of a critical incident response.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical incident responses</field><field name="subject">secondary schools</field><field name="subject">adolescent</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">participatory research</field><field name="subject">school crisis management</field><field name="subject">crisis intervention</field><field name="subject">high school students</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330199 Education studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of protein synthesis in the mammary gland : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hayashi, Amanda Aparecida</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of milk protein synthesis in the lactating mammary gland and their control. The protein synthetic machinery can be regulated during the transcription, translation and degradation stages of mRNA processing. Translation control in eukaryotes involves changes in the activity or other functional properties of the translation factors. These include proteins involved in initiation, peptide-chain elongation and termination of mRNA processing. Changes in the nutritional, physiological and hormonal status of the body are sensed by receptors that signal to a central protein, known as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The mTOR signaling pathway then activates or inhibits the activity of translation factors and kinases involved in the initiation and elongation stage of translation. A major objective of this thesis was to elucidate which genes and pathways are involved in the regulation of milk protein synthesis in the mammary gland and the mechanism(s) that regulate their action. The results presented here show that changes in milk protein production occurring during lactation in response to external stimuli are potentially regulated at the level of translation or subsequent processing rather than by transcriptional regulation (mRNA abundance). The results also show that in response to growth hormone (GH) treatment, which increased the yield of milk protein, the phosphorylation status of the ribosomal protein S6 (S6) is increased as well as the protein abundance of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). These results suggest an important relationship between milk protein yield and changes in the initiation and elongation stages of translation. Another major finding was the elucidation that mTOR is involved in the signaling pathways activated by GH and that this effect involves signaling through the PI-3 kinase pathway. In these experiments, increased protein synthesis was potentially achieved with the use of GH. Thus, this study suggests the mTOR signaling pathway is a key mediator of the GH effects in protein synthesis stimulation. Finally, the requirement for a functional mTOR signaling (TOS) motif in the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP1) was identified. This finding could help the identification of other proteins that may be controlled by mTOR and consequently are regulators of mRNA translation. In summary, this thesis unveils key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of milk protein synthesis and provides further insight into the control of the mTOR signaling pathway. These findings open new frontiers for the manipulation of milk composition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regulation of protein synthesis</field><field name="subject">milk proteins</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/795</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chondrodysplasia of Texel sheep : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Piripi, Susan Amanda</field><field name="description">Chondrodysplasia of Texel sheep is a newly described recessively inherited disorder distinct from other chondrodysplasias described in sheep. Phenotypically normal at birth, affected lambs develop microscopic lesions as early as 9 days of age, and usually demonstrate gross deformities and markedly reduced rates of bone growth by 2 to 3 weeks. Individual bone growth rates are most severely affected in the proximal bones of the forelimbs. Chondrodysplastic lambs typically have short stature, angular limb deformities, a barrel-shaped chest and a wide-based stance. Gross lesions include tracheal narrowing and contortion, enlarged costochondral junctions, and erosion of articular cartilage in major limb joints. Microscopic lesions are confined to hyaline cartilage, and are characterised by degeneration of the interterritorial matrix and dense perichondrocytic rings consisting predominantly of type VI collagen. These lesions are identical in appearance to those in achondrogenesis 1b and diastrophic dysplasia, two diseases caused by defects of the diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter (DTDST) in human beings. An investigation to measure the uptake of radiolabelled sulphate by dermal fibroblasts in vitro did not provide evidence of a defect in the DTDST in chondrodysplastic Texel sheep. A linkage disequilibrium study of ovine chromosomes 1, 5, 6, 13 and 22 using microsatellite DNA markers was unable to identify evidence of a mutation causing this form of chondrodysplasia. Capillary electrophoresis of unsaturated chondroitin sulphate disaccharides demonstrated a relative reduction in the ratio of chondroitin 4-sulphate to chondroitin 6-sulphate in affected animals of all ages. This biochemical feature enables the potential determination of the phenotype of newborn lambs prior to the emergence of gross or microscopic lesions. The pathology of the disease, combined with the findings of the genetic, biochemical and in vitro studies, suggest that a mutation may be present in the CHST11 gene. This gene is a good candidate for future studies aimed at discovering the genetic defect in chondrodysplasia of Texel sheep and developing a test to identify heterozygous animals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chondrodysplasia</field><field name="subject">Texel sheep</field><field name="subject">genetic defects</field><field name="subject">inherited diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300506 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/800</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of renal haemodynamics in the developing kidney - implications for fetal programming</field><field name="creator">Turner, Anita Jillian, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Renal blood flow and micropuncture studies were conducted in late gestation fetal sheep (gestational age 134 - 141 days; term 150 days) and neonatal lambs (8 - 18 days after birth) to study the forces involved in glomerular filtration (GFR) and characterize the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) system during development. These studies required the kidney to be immobilized so stable models in acutely prepared anaesthetized animals were developed. Fetuses were studied in a heated water bath exteriorized from the uterus but with an intact umbilical circulation. The lower GFR in fetuses than lambs was found to be due to both lower net filtration pressures (P&lt;0.001) and a lower ultrafiltration coefficient (P&lt;0.001). TGF was present at both ages, but in fetuses the sensitivity was higher (P&lt;0.001) and reactivity was lower (P&lt;0.001). The reduction in TGF sensitivity between fetal and neonatal life may facilitate the increase in renal blood flow and GFR which occurs at this time. In both fetuses and lambs the sensitivity of the TGF curve was reduced by volume expansion (P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.05) and reactivity was reduced in lambs (P&lt;0.001). Furosemide abolished TGF at both ages. In both fetuses and lambs, TGF reactivity was increased by inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.001) and in lambs, TGF sensitivity was increased (P&lt;0.01). This indicates that nitric oxide produced by the macula densa modulates TGF during development. In offspring destined to become hypertensive due to maternal dexamethasone treatment in early gestation TGF sensitivity tended to be enhanced in fetal life and was enhanced in lambs (P&lt;0.01). Increased TGF sensitivity may contribute to the development of hypertension in this model of developmental programming. The effects of nNOS inhibition were attenuated in these animals, suggesting that they have low tonic production of nitric oxide by the macula densa. In fetuses whose mothers had been subtotally nephrectomized prior to mating to induce maternal mild renal impairment, GFR was increased (P&lt;0.01) but net filtration pressure was reduced (P&lt;0.001) so the ultrafiltration coefficient was increased (P&lt;0.001).

However, in a mark-to-market world, one doesn't have the luxury of reporting one's performance on the basis of yield to maturity.  Total return is calculated for an arbitrary holding period, and must reflect any mark-to-market gains or losses as at the close of the period-gains or losses that can be triggered by the bond's upgrade or downgrade.  Thus to estimate expected total return, one must estimate not only expected default losses, but also the impact on capital price of expected ratings transitions.  This paper begins with the observation that a bond which is blessed by more favourable transition characteristics is likely to produce a higher total return, and poses the question of how that benefit can be quantified.  How much is it worth?  To answer the question, I start by specifying a formal bond-pricing model reflective of ratings transitions.  I survey various statistical methods and past research efforts to identify the ratings-transition matrix which best parametrises the model, and propose a novel test for selecting between competing matrices.  Using this approach, I replicate several important studies of ratings transitions.  I also use it to examine new published and unpublished data, testing for (and finding) ratings path-dependency, and otherwise exploring the effect of ratings changes on different bond sectors.  I then turn to the question of whether it is possible to estimate bond-specific transition probabilities, and propose a way to do so.

Improvements in surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have done little to improve the mortality of this disease over the past 20 years while current clinicopathological predictors of disease outcome are sub-optimal. Identifying molecular targets of prognostic and therapeutic significance in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) may help direct novel therapies to patients whom it is most likely to benefit. Accrued knowledge of the biology of HNSCC has highlighted specific aberrations in pRb and p53 pathways which warrant further study. An immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) in a cohort of 145 patients with SCC of the anterior tongue was performed. Protein expression of the pRb and p53 pathways and related molecules that directly or indirectly influence cell cycle progression at the G1/S phase checkpoint was assessed. We determined that over-expression of E2F-1 occurred in &amp;gt35% of these cancers and associated with improved overall survival on univariate analysis. The strongest multivariate model included: regional lymph node status, tumour grade, p16INK4A, cyclin D1 and p14ARF. This is the first study to determine that p14ARF is an independent marker of both improved diseasefree survival and overall survival in a cohort of SCC of the anterior tongue. Unrecognized molecular heterogeneity is thought to account for the unpredictable clinical response to ZD1839, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We explored the anti-proliferative effects following ZD1839 treatment alone or in combination with radiotherapy in cyclin D1 and E2F-1 over-expressing SCC9 HNSCC cells. SCC9 cells over-expressing cyclin D1 or E2F-1 were highly resistant to ZD1839 treatment, while E2F-1 clones were also radioresistant. Combined therapy in SCC9 controls had a greater anti-proliferative effect than each individual treatment. These data showed that cyclin D1 and E2F-1 may have utility as markers of ZD1839 resistance. The data in this thesis contribute to our knowledge of the clinical behaviour and molecular pathology of HNSCC. Specifically the molecular data identifies novel markers of outcome in SCC of the anterior tongue such as p14ARF, and therapeutic response to ZD1839 such as cyclin D1 and E2F-1. This study addresses in part, the current issues and limitations of management in HNSCC and has the potential to contribute to strategies that may be developed to improve the outcome for patients who develop HNSCC in the future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">squamous cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">head -- cancer; neck -- cancer; molecular diagnosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22460</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abajo el puente: place and the politics of progress in Santo Domingo</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Erin B</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progress</field><field name="subject">urban anthropology</field><field name="subject">santo domingo</field><field name="subject">squatter settlement</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4748</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a theory about change in Australian software firms</field><field name="creator">Rankine, Tim</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development of a body of theory explaining why the principals of Australian software firms have difficulty in changing the organizational structures of their businesses. The need for change is predicated on the view that availability of capital is an essential prerequisite for sustainable growth in Australian software firms and that firm principals, in the main, have not implemented organizational structures preferred by Australian investors. A grounded theory approach is used, drawing upon personal knowledge of the software industry using sense making and self ethnography research methods. Personal knowledge is complemented with data from semi-structured interviews and secondary sources. Concepts developed from the data are related to theoretical and empirical work under the rubric of organization studies. What emerges from the data and the literature is: firstly, the Australian software industry is likely to consist of multiple organizational fields each one of which encompasses a small number of software firms servicing customers in specific vertical markets; secondly, to attract capital the principals of Australian software firms will need to change the structure of their organizations and thirdly, change will be radical and revolutionary in nature and may be difficult to achieve. This thesis contributes to the organizational studies literature by extending existing work to include an analysis of issues use of institutional theory addresses a gap in the present understanding of the manner in which the principals of Australian software firms approach the establishment of structures required of sustainable growing businesses.

The Masters Thesis identifies the potential for Perth's geographic isolation to manifest as a positive construct, developing a unique architecture that opportunistically reinterprets past traditions to create individual environments. 'Constructed Isolation' is an ambitious idea where identity may begin with the individual dwelling and collectively evolve to create a constellation of considerable influence. It demonstrates how these devices may result in new propositions for suburbia, how big ideas with small-scale projects and a little irrational joyousness may contribute to or at least aspire to create change.    These small projects will be viewed as a continuation of Perth's 'Heroic Period of Modernism', the fertile and ambitious but incomplete project from the 1950s and '60s.

It is now more than ten years since the publication of that study. Growing international concern for environmental matters has since led to the issue of International Auditing Practice Statement (IAPS) -1010: The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial report in 1998 and, in New Zealand, Audit Guidance Statement (AGS) -1010: The consideration of environmental matters in the audit of a financial statement in 2001. Yet, to date, there has been no examination of the impact of IAPS-1010 or AGS-1010 on either current audit practice, or the issues raised by Collison (1996) and Collison and Gray (1997). This doctoral thesis has attempted to address the environmental impact gap in the auditing research literature. In particular, it has investigated the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports in the light of AGS-1010, with a view to understanding better the following issues: (1) how auditors generally perceive the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports; (2) the common approaches and practices auditors undertake when auditing environmental matters; (3) the challenges (if any) that auditors face in the audit of environmental matters (4) the impact (if any) of AGS 1010 on current audit practice and, finally, (5) how current practices in the audit of environmental matters may be improved and further developed to meet better the espoused aims of AGS-1010. Qualitative interviews with twenty-seven senior financial audit practitioners and others in New Zealand provided the basis for the findings. The interviews were taped, transcribed and managed with the use of computerised qualitative analysis software (NViVo7). Key findings from the research interviews were as follows: (1) the introduction of AGS-1010 had little impact on current audit practice in New Zealand; (2) environmental matters were treated no differently from any other audit issues, and auditors tended to apply common, familiar audit approaches in dealing with environmental matters; (3) auditors found the effective auditing of environmental matters challenging owing to their inability to identify such matters, and their lack of relevant expert knowledge. The most significant finding from this study is that, in general, common audit practices were riddled with issues of concern. These issues point to a broader and more significant problem. It would seem that current audit practices fail to consider many potential audit issues (including environmental matters) adequately in the audit of financial reports. For auditors to be more effective in their audit practice and in protecting the public interest, not only does audit methodology need a major review, but auditors themselves need to change their attitudes and mindsets in their approach to auditing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial auditing</field><field name="subject">Environmental matters</field><field name="subject">Audit practice</field><field name="subject">Financial reporting</field><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Legitimacy theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and application of the spectral warping transform to digital signal processing</field><field name="creator">Allen, Warwick Peter Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a thorough analysis of the theoretical foundations and properties of the Spectral Warping Transform. The spectral warping transform is defined as a time-domain-to-time-domain digital signal processing transform that shifts the frequency components of a signal along the frequency axis. The z -transform coefficients of a warped signal correspond to z -domain &#8216;samples&#8217; of the original signal that are unevenly spaced along the unit circle (equivalently, frequency-domain coefficients of the warped signal correspond to frequency-domain samples of the original signal that are unevenly spaced along the frequency axis). The location of these unevenly spaced frequency-domain samples is determined by a z -domain mapping function. This function may be arbitrary, except that it must map the unit circle to the unit circle. It is shown that, in addition to the frequency location, the bandwidth, duration and amplitude of each frequency component of a signal are affected by spectral warping. Specifically, frequency components within bands that are expanded in frequency have shortened durations and larger amplitudes (conversely, components in compressed frequency bands become longer with smaller amplitudes). A property related to the expansion and compression of the duration of frequency components is that if a signal is time delayed (its digital sequence is prepended with zeroes) then each of the frequency components will have a different delay after warping. This time-domain separation phenomenon is useful for separating in time the frequency components of a signal. Such separation is employed in the generation of spectrally flat chirp signals. Because spectral warping will generally expand the duration of some frequency components within a signal, the transform must produce more output samples than there are (non-zero) input samples in order to avoid time-domain aliasing. A discussion of the necessary output signal length is presented. Particular attention is given to spectral warping using all-pass mapping function, which can be realised as a cascade of all-pass filters. There exists an efficient hardware implementation for this all-pass SW realisation [1, 2]. A proof-of-concept application-specific integrated circuit that performs the core operations required by this algorithm was developed. Another focus of the presented research is spectral warping using a piecewise- linear mapping function. This type of spectral warping has the advantage that the changes in frequency, duration and amplitude between the non-warped and warped signals are constant factors over fixed frequency bands. A matrix formulation of the spectral warping transformation is developed. It presents the spectral warping transform as a single matrix multiplication. The transform matrix is the product of the three matrices that represent three conceptual steps. The first step is to apply a discrete Fourier transform to the time-domain signal, providing the frequency-domain representation. Step two is an interpolation to produce the signal content at the desired new frequency samples. This interpolation effectively provides the frequency warping. The final step is an inverse DFT to transform the signal back into the time domain. A special case of the spectral warping transform matrix has the same result as a linear (finite-impulse-response) filter, showing that spectral warping is a generalisation of linear filtering. The conditions for the invertibility of the spectral warping transformation are derived. Several possible realisation of the SW transform are discussed. These include two realisation using parallel finite-impulse-response filter banks and a realisation that uses a cascade of infinite-impulse-response filters. Finally, examples of applications for the spectral warping transform are given. These include: non-uniform spectral analysis (and signal generation), approximate spectral analysis in the time domain, and filter design. This thesis concludes that the SW transform is a useful tool for the manipulation of the frequency content of digital signals, and is particularly useful when the frequency content of a signal (or the frequency response of a system) over a limited band is of interest. It is also claimed that the SW transform may have valuable applications for embedded mixed-signal testing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spectal warping transform</field><field name="subject">digital system processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291703 Digital systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/807</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyester synthases and polyester granule assembly : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Peters, Verena</field><field name="description">PHAs are a class of biopolymers consisting of (R)-3-hydroxy-fatty acids and are produced by the majority of eubacteria and some archaeal bacteria as carbon storage material. In general, PHA is synthesised when a carbon source is available in excess while another essential nutrient is limited. The key enzyme of PHA biosynthesis, the PHA synthase, catalyses the polymerisation of the substrate (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to PHA accompanied by the release of coenzyme A. PHA is stored intracellularly as inclusions, the so-called PHA granules. When the external carbon source becomes exhausted, bacteria can metabolise these carbon inclusions by degradation of the polymer. PHA granules are water-insoluble, spherical inclusions of approximately 50-500 nm in diameter which consist of a hydrophobic polyester core surrounded by a phospholipid layer with embedded and attached proteins. One could consider isolated PHA granules as bio-beads due to their structure and size. In this study we tested if the PHA synthase can be used as an anchor molecule in order to display proteins of interest at the PHA granule surface. Furthermore, these modified PHA granules were analysed for their potential applicability as bio-beads in biotechnological procedures. The concept of using the PHA synthase as granule-anchoring molecule for display of proteins of interest was established by the functional display of the &#223;- galactosidase at PHA granules. This &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; was followed by the display of biotechnologically more interesting proteins. The IgG binding domain of protein A as well as streptavidin, which is known for its biotin binding ability, were fused to the PHA synthase, respectively, and therefore localised at the PHA granule surfaces during PHA granule assembly, resulting in functional bio-protein A -beads and bio-streptavidin-beads. Moreover, their applicability in biotechnological assays was demonstrated. Recently, we fused the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the PHA synthase and demonstrated that the PHA granule assembly does not start randomly distributed in the cytoplasm but occurred localised at or near the cell poles. To further investigate if the localisation of the PHA granule formation process is due to polar positional information inherent to the PHA synthase, different mutated versions of the PHA synthase of Cupriavidus necator were created and analysed for a potential alteration in localisation. Furthermore, the phasin protein PhaP1 of C. necator was fused to HcRed, a far-red fluorescent protein, and localisation studies were accomplished when the fusion protein was expressed under different conditions in Escherichia coli.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PHA biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">PHA granule assembly</field><field name="subject">microbial polymers</field><field name="subject">polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase</field><field name="subject">protein engineering</field><field name="subject">bio-beads</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/808</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On fast and space-efficient database normalization : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Koehler, Henning</field><field name="description">A common approach in designing relational databases is to start with a relation schema, which is then decomposed into multiple subschemas. A good choice of sub- schemas can often be determined using integrity constraints defined on the schema. Two central questions arise in this context. The first issue is what decompositions should be called "good", i.e., what normal form should be used. The second issue is how to find a decomposition into the desired form. These question have been the subject of intensive research since relational databases came to life. A large number of normal forms have been proposed, and methods for their computation given. However, some of the most popular proposals still have problems: - algorithms for finding decompositions are inefficient - dependency preserving decompositions do not always exist - decompositions need not be optimal w.r.t. redundancy/space/update anomalies We will address these issues in this work by: - designing effcient algorithms for finding dependency preserving decompositions - proposing a new normal form which minimizes overall storage space. This new normal form is then characterized syntactically, and shown to extend existing normal forms.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">database normalisation</field><field name="subject">database design</field><field name="subject">new normal form</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An infrastructure of interaction : complexity theory and the space of movement in the urban street : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Helen</field><field name="description">This study uses complexity theory to examine the space of the street. In a morpho-ecological city, process creates form just as form creates process. The process of movement is a critical form generator within the urban system. In this thesis, the urban system comprising streets/ car/pedestrian is examined. If this collection of urban modes of mobility is a complex system capable of selforganising behaviour, what effect does the ordering imposed by traffic engineering have on this system? I look at the driving body and the walking body as co-creating the city by their movement through urban space. I suggest that, through attention to the fragments of interactions enacted during these movements, we can, through design, allow for the emergence of selforganising behaviour. Urban shared streets, descendants of the &#8216;woonerf&#8217;, appear to function more efficiently than engineered streets, without the usual traffic ordering. The counterintuitive success of these streets implies a self-organising behaviour that is generated by the density of interaction between the inhabitants of the street. These designs potentially work as a change agent, a catalyst, operating within a complex system. This has the potential to move systems from one attractor state to another. A city built with these spaces becomes a city of enfilades; an open system of spaces that are adaptable to uses that fluctuate with time and avoid thickening the palimpsest of traffic engineering. I look at siting shared streets in Wellington, based on jaywalking, a transgressive use of the streetspace that prefigures a shared space, and changes to urban networks associated with such designs. Interaction within the city is a creative force with a structure. City design needs to consider and address this infrastructure and design for it. The infrastructure of interaction has been subsumed by the infrastructure of movement. Shared streets indicate there may not be a need for this &#8211; they can be integrated. The process of movement creates instances of interaction; therefore designing spaces of/for movement must be designed to enhance the infrastructure of interaction. The result of such interaction is not just somewhat better; it may be a phase change - catalytically better .</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">urban streets</field><field name="subject">urban space</field><field name="subject">urban design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310103 Urban and regional planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/805</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of the EAS gene cluster for ergot alkaloid biosynthesis in epichlo&#235; endophytes of grasses : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fleetwood, Damien James</field><field name="description">Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes of the genera Epichlo&#235; and Neotyphodium form symbioses with grasses of the family Pooideae in which they can synthesise an array of bioprotective alkaloids. Some strains produce the ergot alkaloid ergovaline, which is implicated in livestock toxicoses caused by ingestion of endophyteinfected grasses. Cloning and analysis of a plant-induced non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene from Neotyphodium lolii and analysis of the E. festucae E2368 genome sequence revealed a complex gene cluster for ergot alkaloid biosynthesis. The EAS cluster contained a single-module NRPS gene, lpsB, and other genes orthologous to genes in the ergopeptine gene cluster of Claviceps purpurea and the clavine cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus. Functional analysis of lpsB confirmed its role in ergovaline synthesis and bioassays with the lpsB mutant unexpectedly suggested that ergovaline was not required for black beetle (Heteronychus arator) feeding deterrence from epichlo&#235;-infected grasses. Southern analysis showed the cluster was linked with previously identified ergot alkaloid biosynthetic genes, dmaW and lpsA, at a subtelomeric location. The ergovaline genes are closely associated with transposon relics, including retrotransposons, autonomous DNA transposons and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), which are very rare in other fungi. All genes in the cluster were highly expressed in planta but expression was very low or undetectable in mycelia from axenic culture, including under nitrogen-, carbonor phosphate-limited conditions. Comparative analysis of the EAS gene cluster in four different epichlo&#235; strains showed marked differences in gene expression and ergot alkaloid synthesis. Gene order is conserved in each strain although evidence for recombination between two MITEs and expansion or reduction of a simple sequence repeat (SSR) at a single intergenic region was observed. Heterologous expression of a candidate regulatory gene, laeA, from Aspergillus nidulans, which is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in aspergilli, did not affect eas gene expression. This, along with phylogeny and microsynteny analysis, suggests there is not an orthologue of this gene in epichlo&#235;.

However, the literature has focused on how corporations manage issues, while public service organisations have been ignored. This study looked at the issues management of a tephra dam-break lahar from 1996-2007 on Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand by a group of public service organisations. 19 interviews were conducted with people involved with the management of the &#8216;lahar issue&#8217; to find out how the issue was managed. Further a content analysis of 309 articles from five newspapers, spanning the full eleven year period, was conducted to examine the salience (attention) given to the issue, the frames commonly used to present the issue and the sources who &#8216;drove&#8217; the issue. The data from the content analysis was interpreted to create a five-stage lifecycle of the &#8216;lahar issue&#8217;. Further, data from the interviews was compared with a summary process of the issue management process. This comparison showed that five issues management process stages were employed to manage the &#8216;lahar issue&#8217; although they were not referred to as such. Initially, the Department of Conservation consulted stakeholders during the development of options to deal with the lahar (1996-1999). Later in the lahar&#8217;s management, lahar stakeholders fell into two categories: internal - those involved with the mitigation and response - and external - the public. Internal stakeholders were communicated with through meetings and email. External stakeholders were communicated with through local media, presentations and meetings. Overall, it was concluded that media gave substantial attention to the lahar issue over the eleven year period. Some of those involved with managing the &#8216;lahar issue&#8217; were able to identify the phases of media coverage. Further, this study identified ten frames that media employed when reporting the lahar. The most-frequently used frames were those focusing on the response (lahar response), describing the lahar (diagnosing causes of problem(s)) and discussing the potential impacts from a lahar (definition of problem(s)). Department of Conservation Scientist, Dr Harry Keys, was shown to be a primary definer &#8211; an influential source. The results suggest he defined coverage because of his status as both an official source, due to the organisation he was associated with, and also as an authoritative source due to his role as a scientist.

Reduced levels of salivary S-IgA have been associated with an increased risk for upper respiratory symptoms (URS) in athletes. Previously, the consumption of a nutrition supplement, bovine colostrum (BC) by distance runners, was shown to significantly increase levels of salivary S-IgA compared to baseline; however the mechanism was not known. The immunomodulatory effect of BC is investigated further in these current studies. Twenty-five swimmers (12 males [M], 13 females [F], age 14-23 years) training at an elite level, 28 lightly-exercising students (9M, 19F, age 18-27 years), and 45 healthy older adults (20M, 20F, age 65-76 years), consumed a supplement of either BC or placebo for ten weeks. Saliva samples were collected at baseline, weekly for four weeks during supplementation and post-supplementation. Blood samples were collected at baseline, monthly during supplementation and post-supplementation. No significant changes were seen in levels of S-IgA in either BC or placebo groups within any of the cohorts. There was a trend towards a significant difference in URS reportage between BC and placebo groups in the swimmers cohort, but not in the students or older adults. There was also a trend towards a difference in the number of swimmers reporting URS. Fewer numbers of swimmers consuming BC reported URS compared the placebo (P=0.062) after consuming BC for four weeks compared to those consuming the placebo. Post-exercise plasma cortisol results were significantly reduced in the BC subgroup compared to the placebo (P=0.004). These results do not support the findings of previous intervention studies investigating the immunomodulatory effect of BC in athletes. However the reduced reportage of URS, among swimmers consuming the BC supplement, suggested there was some benefit to their health. A possible explanation is that BC has impacted on non-infectious causes of URS. Growth factors present in BC may enhance intestinal repair which could be advantageous to athletes recovering from bouts of prolonged intensive exercise. The effect of gastrointestinal disturbances on local and systemic immunity may be minimised which benefits immune protection. However an inconsistent effect of BC supplementation on immune protection in athletes means further research is still required. In these studies there was no benefit to immune protection in the student or older adult cohort. Further investigation into the safety of BC for all population groups is still required.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bovine colostrum supplemementation</field><field name="subject">secretory immunoglobulin-A (S-IgA)</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">intestinal repair</field><field name="subject">athletes</field><field name="subject">older adults</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320200 Immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/802</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the synthesis of block and graft copolymers with well defined segment lengths</field><field name="creator">Postma, Almar, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The synthesis of amine end-functionalised polymers by controlled free radical techniques has been investigated with a focus on methods that provide primary amino end-functionalised polystyrene. The aim of these investigations was to provide precursors to block and graft polyolefins and polyesters by interchain coupling reactions. The approaches investigated involved developing strategies for the synthesis of phthalimido-functional polymers which can be quantitatively deprotected to yield the desired amino-functional polymers. Initially synthesis by atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) was explored. A number of approaches based on ??-functionalisation (end-group substitution) and ??-functionalisation (functional initiator) were examined. A novel ATRP initiator, N-bromomethylphthalimide, provided the most promising results but still had limited applicability because of its low solubility in polymerisation media. The problems encountered with the ATRP approaches prompted an exploration of techniques based on reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) approach. Novel phthalimidomethyl RAFT agents (trithiocabonates, xanthates) were synthesized. The activity and scope of the new RAFT agents was investigated in polymerisations of styrene, n-butyl acrylate, Nisopropylacrylamide, N-vinylpyrrolidone (trithiocarbonate) and vinyl acetate (xanthate). The syntheses of ??-phthalimidomethylpolystyrene were successfully scaled up and hydrazinolysis afforded a range of ??- aminomethylpolystyrenes of low polydispersity and controlled molecular weight. The syntheses of primary amino-functional polymers using the pthalimidofunctional RAFT agents necessitated the development of a convenient method for conversion of trithiocarbonate groups to inert chain ends. Thermolysis proved a most simple and efficient method of achieving this for both polystyrene and poly(n-butyl acrylate). Thermolysis also provided a means of further characterising the mechanism of the RAFT process.  A simple and efficient method for amino end-group analysis was developed that involved in-situ derivatisation with trichloroacetyl isocyanate followed by 1H NMR analysis. The method was shown to be a suitable method for determining a wide range protic end-groups (NH2, OH, COOH) in synthetic polymers. Finally, metallocene polyolefin based coupling trials largely with controlled amino-functional polystyrene were conducted as an initial investigation into the production of high value added grafted polyolefins (and polyester). The grafting trials were carried out on a small scale with a view to directing future experiments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">block</field><field name="subject">graft</field><field name="subject">copolymers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32822</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eco-spirituality: Collective identity and spirituality in the wilderness action group</field><field name="creator">Apoifis, Nicholas, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">At a peripheral glance the collective action of a social movement group creates a perception of rational and homogenous internal group identity.

A discourse analysis of 
nursing professionalisation 
in South Australia since the 1950s</field><field name="creator">Kako, Mayumi</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken using Foucault&#146;s genealogical approach to explore an aspect in the governmentality of the nursing profession from the 1950s to the present. It uses developments in the education of nurses in South Australia as a case in point, but includes, at all stages, a concomitant analysis of global trends in the profession and education of nurses. Hence, data were collected from historical documents such as government reports, professional nursing journals, nursing text books and curriculum documents across the period for analysis, from South Australia and Flinders University as a particular case. I thought of these texts as data and examples of the production of discourses about nursing education and practice influenced by the Foucauldian method of process of The Archaeology of Knowledge (1972). These discourses produced in both social and professional spheres mirror the sociological knowledge development of the professionalisation agenda that has enveloped the process of professional legitimacy since the Second World War. The interactions are described intertextuality, with each chapter in this thesis presenting the interconnectedness of a variety of discourses. The Foucauldian perspective achieved the purpose of seeking how nursing was shaped by the society and influenced society to form what constituted a nursing professional, to the present time.

&#145;Uncertainty&#146; in the nursing profession was the key concept found in the investigation. Nursing attempted to reduce uncertainty by regulating nursing education, and by setting boundaries for the practice of professional nursing. This governmentality generation process reflects other forms of surveillance developed during the late 20th century, and was used to establish the subjectivity of nurses in terms of &#145;who&#146; has the right to define nursing and its knowledge systems. The role of the nurse and the requirements for a nurse were emphasised as personal characteristics rather than as professional behaviour when nurse &#145;training&#146; occurred solely in the hospitals. Who defined the role of nurse and who could be a nurse was decided by medical officers and administrators rather than nurses themselves. As the description of the role of the nurse was expanded to the social sphere, the debates about the appropriate place for nursing students&#146; training was influential in bringing about change. Establishing nursing education in the tertiary sector facilitated the professionalisation of nursing. I explored curriculum development as an example of the internal governmentality of nursing. The historical analysis of curriculum development processes at an Australian university and its antecedent organisations, showed how nursing educators think about nursing and the role of nurse and how they reflect these requirements in the teaching of nursing students. The way of thinking about nursing and the professional nurse role was also actively observed in the discourses arguing for the use of the thinking tools of nursing such as the nursing process, other problem-solving approaches and latterly for the use of clinical reasoning. 

This study uncovered the process of handling uncertainty internal and external to nursing through processes of professional education. Uncertainty control was an essential in nursing education and thinking tools were key in the process for nursing educators to re-set the parameters of nursing. Professional education aims to develop both the individual nurse and the profession, as a whole, which may lead to conflicts of interest. Therefore, it is important for nurse educators to be aware of these potential conflicts of interests in their governmental strategies. It is also necessary to develop an interactive and corroborative curriculum that includes the many stakeholders interested in the development of the nursing profession.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">professionalisation</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20080923.101618</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conversation on globalisation and digital art</field><field name="creator">Milton-Smith, Melissa</field><field name="description">Globalisation is one of the most important cultural phenomena of our times and yet, one of the least understood. In popular and critical discourse there has been a struggle to articulate its human affects. The tendency to focus upon macro accounts can leave gaps in our understanding of its micro experiences.1 1 As Jonathon Xavier Inda and Renato Rosaldo argue there is a strong pattern of thinking about globalisation 'principally in terms of very large-scale economic, political, or cultural processes'. (See: Jonathon Xavier Inda and Renato Rosaldo (Eds.), The Anthropology of Globalisation: A Reader, Malden, Blackwell Publishing, 2002, p. 5.) In this thesis, I will describe globalisation as a dynamic matrix of flows. I will argue that globalisation's spatial, temporal, and kinetic re-arrangements have particular impacts upon bodies and consciousnesses, creating contingent and often unquantifiable flows. I will introduce digital art as a unique platform of articulation: a style borne of globalisation's oeuvre, and technically well-equipped to converse with and emulate its affects. By exploring digital art through an historical lens I aim to show how it continues dialogues established by earlier art forms. I will claim that digital art has the capacity to re-centre globalisation around the individual, through sensory and experiential forms that encourage subjective and affective encounters. By approaching it in this way, I will move away from universal theorems in favour of particular accounts. Through exploring a wide array of digital artworks, I will discuss how digital art can capture fleeting experiences and individual expressions. I will closely examine its unique tools of articulation to include: immersive, interactive, haptic, and responsive technologies, and analyse the theories and ideas that they converse with. Through this iterative process, I aim to explore how digital art can both facilitate and generate new articulations of globalisation, as an experiential phenomenon.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer art</field><field name="subject">Computers and civilization</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Digital media -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">Visual communication -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Globalisation</field><field name="subject">Globalization</field><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">New media</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0057</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the contrary : counter-narratives of British women travellers, 1832-1885</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Carol</field><field name="description">This study examines five counter-narratives written by British women between 1832 and 1885 who wrote in a non-conformist or negative manner about their travel experiences in foreign countries. In considering a small number of women travellers who took an alternative approach to narrating their experiences, a key objective of this study is to consider the reasons for the way in which the women writing counter-narratives positioned their writing. After considering how the quasi-scientific concept of domestic womanhood attempted to restrict Victorian women in general, and in particular influenced how women travellers were viewed, an exploration of counter-narratives questions whether the sustained interest in more positive travel accounts reflects a simplified contemporary, if not feminist, reading of Victorian women. An examination follows of the influence of discourse criticism, alternative interpretations of geographical space, and the presence of intertextuality in travel writing. The chapters are then arranged chronologically, with each counter-narrative being analysed as emanating from the range of discourses that were in conflict during the period. The writers form a varied group, travelling and living in five different countries, with a range of contradictory voices. Susannah Moodie and Emily Innes are outspoken in their criticism of British government policy for Canada and the Malay States respectively; Isabella Fane in India and Emmeline Lott in Egypt are disdainful of foreign practices which were otherwise considered fascinating on account of their exoticism; Frances Elliot differentiates her writing by opposing the ubiquitous influence of guidebooks for European travel. Thus each account records an aspect of political or cultural opposition to established discourses circulating at the time, as the women challenge the 'grand narratives' of foreign travel in different ways. Because such accounts may be challenged by literature of the period, the study positions the women in the context of their contemporaries, and thus each chapter examines the counter-narrative alongside another account by a female writer who travelled or lived in a similar area during the same era. Moreover, before examining the range of discursive complexities and tensions that emerge in each case study, the writers are positioned in their geographical locations and historical moments so that the texts are read against the cultural background to which the women were originally responding. The marginalisation of such counter-narratives has led to gaps in our understanding of travel writing from the period: where accounts once coexisted they are separated, and positive accounts are privileged over negative ones. It is this discontinuity of knowledge that the study will address in order to create a truer picture of the diversity of travel writing at the time.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discourse analysis, Narrative</field><field name="subject">Narration (Rhetoric)</field><field name="subject">Travel in literature</field><field name="subject">Women and literature -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Women travelers in literature</field><field name="subject">19th century women</field><field name="subject">Travellers</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0058</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between physical activity, self-perceptions and physical status in adolescents and adults</field><field name="creator">Zillmann, Nadine</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Regular engagement in physical activity is proven to decrease the risk of numerous chronic diseases and to improve mental well-being. However, many children and adults around the world fail to engage in sufficient levels of activity required to produce health benefits, with reports showing physical activity levels still on the decline. Perhaps because of this increase in sedentary lifestyles, obesity has become one of the biggest public health threats in the 21st century. Furthermore, both obesity and physical inactivity are closely related to psychological health, and may play an important role in shaping self-perceptions and feeling of general well-being. '...'  In the first study, physical status, physical activity levels, and social physique anxiety measures were obtained from an adolescent sample of 259 participants. Partial correlation analyses revealed that physical activity involvement was not directly linked with physical status; however, both factors were significantly associated with social physique anxiety, which suggested evidence of an indirect link between the two constructs. That is, analyses showed that poor physical status was associated with higher levels of physique anxiety, which in turn linked to low engagement in physical activity. In addition, age and gender effects emerged, revealing unique differences in the ways in which these three variables may be related. To cross-validate and further examine these relationships STUDY 2 extended the range of self-perception measures to include a multidimensional assessment of physical self-concept and a global self-esteem measure along with physique anxiety. These variables were assessed in a German adult sample (N = 229), again alongside measures of physical status and physical activity involvement. Consistent with STUDY 1, no direct link was found between physical status and levels of physical activity involvement. However, evidence of an indirect link did emerge as both variables were related to multiple dimensions of physical self-concept, thereby reinforcing and extending the findings from STUDY 1. Furthermore, age effects emerged for physical self-concept, which had not been confirmed in previous research on physical self-concept. STUDY 3 employed a longitudinal design and investigated changes in physical self-concept, global self-esteem and social physique anxiety before, during, and after participation in a 12-week weight management programme. Participants (N = 63) were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) cognitive-behavioural treatment only, (2) cognitive-behavioural treatment and exercise, and (3) non-treatment control. Statistical analyses revealed a small, but significant reduction in weight for members of both treatment groups. Relative to controls, both treatment groups also improved on a variety of physical self-concept dimensions. At the same time, however, significant group main effects suggested that a weight-loss program incorporating exercise involvement may provide physical self-concept benefits that go beyond those obtained with standard CBT regimes. Collectively, these studies add to the growing body of literature on the connections between physical activity, self-perceptions and physical status. They also highlight the importance of involvement in habitual physical activity throughout the lifespan. Findings are discussed with regards to their contribution to the extant literature, and applied implications, limitations, and future directions are considered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Health behavior</field><field name="subject">Obesity in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Overweight persons -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Self-perception in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Sports -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Self-concept</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Overweight</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0059</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Sieur de Machy and the French solo viol tradition</field><field name="creator">Ng, Shaun Kam Fook</field><field name="description">During the late seventeenth century in France, the viol was beginning to emerge as one of the most important musical instruments of the day. French luthiers had created the quintessential French viol, which allowed violists in France to make their mark on viol playing, both as performers and teachers. So fervent was this enterprise that players soon formed cliques, creating two opposing schools of viol playing. One of the main protagonists who is the focus of this thesis, De Machy, led one of these schools. Although we are fully aware of this historical dichotomy, it is widely assumed that De Machy's rivals were the eventual victors of this conflict, and thus have become the model for modern violists to emulate. This has, however, encouraged modern violists to completely disregard the efforts of De Machy, which, as this thesis shall demonstrate, are as important as those of his contemporaries. Chapter 1 discusses De Machy's place in modern scholarship, giving readers an overall view of the kinds of biases and prejudices that currently exist. It also serves to act as a brief collation and analysis of modern writings that discuss De Machy. Chapter 2 provides us with a historical account of the viol in France, giving special emphasis to solo viol playing. It also traces the evolution of musical style and playing technique as well as the development of the instrument within its social role. Chapter 3 discusses French ornamentation on plucked instruments, keyboard instruments and the viol, giving special emphasis to De Machy's own ideas on ornamentation. Possible explanations for the proper execution of these ornaments are also provided. Chapter 4 revaluates Rousseau and the Trait&#233; de la Viole (1687), and seeks to determine its reliability as a credible source of information. Chapter 5 describes and analyses the quarrel between De Machy and Rousseau as described by Rousseau in the R&#233;ponce de Monsieur Rousseau (1688). In addition to providing a more complete picture of the social interactions of the viol community of the late seventeenth century, this chapter seeks to better explain the issues that De Machy and Rousseau argued about. Chapter 6 examines historical and modern writings and attempts to explain one of the main issues of aforementioned quarrel, the left hand position otherwise known as the ports de main as advocated by De Machy. Appendix A reproduces the avertissement from De Machy's Pi&#232;ces de Violle. The facsimile of the original publication is presented alongside the English translation. This document is central to many of the issues discussed in this thesis. Appendix B is an English translation of the R&#233;ponce de Monsieur Rousseau. One of the aims of this thesis is to re-examine the history of the viol in France, and more specifically, its use as a solo instrument. It is through De Machy's Pi&#232;ces de Violle and Rousseau's R&#233;ponce that most of this information is centred.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Demachy, Mr.,</field><field name="subject">Music -- France -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">Viol music</field><field name="subject">Viola da gamba music</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0060</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neotectonic and palaeoseismological studies in the southwest of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Estrada Roldan, Beatriz Elena</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The southwest of Western Australia is an intraplate area classified as a stable continental region. It comprises predominantly Archaean and Proterozoic geology and has generally subdued topography. The region currently experiences significant seismicity in the Southwest Seismic Zone (SWSZ), which is one of the most seismically active areas in Australia and is thought to represent the highest seismic hazard of the region. In recent years, numerous scarps, potentially related to large palaeoearthquakes have been recognised not only within the SWSZ, but also in a broader region of the southwest of Australia. Palaeoseismological investigations of two of these scarps, the Dumbleyung and the Lort River scarps, confirm their association with surface-rupturing palaeoearthquakes and indicate events with likely maximum magnitudes of ~Mw 7.0 on faults of low to medium slip rates. Two trenches across the Dumbleyung Fault scarp revealed a thrust fault in alluvial sediments with two associated earthquakes in the last ca 24-60 ka. A possible Holocene age was recognised for the last recorded earthquake event exposed in these trenches. Two trenches across the Lort River Scarp show that this feature results from thrust faulting in the weathered gneissic country rock. These trenches exposed evidence of two events in the last ca 35 ka, with a likely late Pleistocene age for the last earthquake. On both sites, the earthquakes are interpreted as associated with the last phase of fault activity, which was likely been preceded by a long period of quiescence. Assessment of the earthquake hazard associated with large earthquakes at the Dumbleyung and Lort River Faults resulted in calculated peak ground accelerations of up to 2 g in the near-fault fields. Such earthquakes would significantly affect nearby towns such as Dumbleyung, Wagin, Katanning, and Esperance, but they are unlikely to cause any significant damage in Perth. The palaeoseismological investigations show that the earthquake activity in the southwest of Western Australia is not only confined to the SWSZ, as it has been considered in previous assessments of the seismic hazard, but that there is also potential for strong earthquakes across much of the region. The seismicity in the southwest of Western Australia appears to be transient and migratory. This is suggested by the lack of local relief associated with places of current seismicity and fault scarps, the widespread distribution of the fault scarps across the region, the increase in seismicity in the SWSZ following strong recent events, and the apparent long periods of earthquake recurrence at fault sites. Accordingly, the current seismicity in the SWSZ is inferred to be transient and probably associated with stress changes produced by the recent earthquakes. '...' This uplift could be associated with dynamic topography effects resulting from processes along the plate margins. The uplift is probably enhanced by a flexural response of the lithosphere to local differential loads and density contrast along the southern margin, a mechanism that may also help explain the occurrence of some earthquake activity. The results from this study, complemented by additional palaeoseismological studies must be included in future probabilistic assessments of the seismic hazard of the southwest of Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earthquake hazard analysis -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Earthquakes -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Faults (Geology) -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Groundwater flow -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Neotectonics -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Seismic waves -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Seismic hazard</field><field name="subject">Seismicity</field><field name="subject">Palaeoseismology</field><field name="subject">Neotectonics</field><field name="subject">Southwest seismic zone</field><field name="subject">Drainage analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0061</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and prevalence of dementia in indigenous Australians</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kathryn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Until recently, there was no dementia screening tool for Indigenous Australians and a paucity of information on the extent of dementia in Indigenous Australians. This thesis describes the development and validation of a tool to assess cognitive impairment in remote Indigenous Australians with the primary purpose of determining the prevalence of dementia and other associated conditions in this population. The tool was reevaluated with the larger prevalence sample and a short version of the tool was developed and evaluated. The Kimberley Indigenous Cognitive Assessment (KICA) tool was validated with Indigenous Australians aged over 45 years from the Kimberley region of Western Australia (n=70). The results were later confirmed in a larger sample from the remote Kimberley (n=363), and an additional sample in rural and remote areas of the Northern Territory (n=47). The KICA results were compared to independent consensus diagnoses using DSM-IV and ICD-10. Interpreters were used whenever participants were not proficient in English. These data led to the determination of a cut-off score of 33/34 out of a possible total score of 39 for the cognitive component of the KICA (KICA-Cog), with a sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.95 and AUC of 0.98. The tool is now widely used within remote areas of Australia. A short version of the KICACog (sKICA-Cog) was developed and found to be a valid brief screening tool for dementia in the Kimberley population, and had a cut-off score of 20/21 out of a possible 25, with a sensitivity of 0.89, specificity of 0.95 and AUC of 0.98. The sKICA-Cog should be used in combination with the KICA cognitive informant questionnaire (KICA-IQ). The KICA-IQ cut-off score of 2/3 out of a possible 16 was determined, with a sensitivity of 0.76 and specificity of 0.84 and AUC of 0.91. Using the validated KICA, the prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment not dementia (CIND) was determined in a semi-purposive sample consisting of 363 Indigenous Australians aged over 45 years from 6 Aboriginal communities and one town in the Kimberley region. Participants were screened with the full KICA and 165 participants had an independent specialist review with consensus diagnoses. The prevalence of dementia was 12.4%, 5.2 times greater than the Australian prevalence of 2.4%, after age adjustment. The prevalence of CIND was 8.0%. Characteristics associated with dementia included older age, male gender (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4, 6.8), no formal education (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1, 6.7), smoking (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.1, 18.6), previous stroke (OR 17.9, 95% CI 5.9, 49.7), epilepsy (OR 33.5, 95% CI 4.8, 232.3) and head injury (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.7, 9.4). Other factors associated with dementia included incontinence, falls and poor mobility. The KICA is a valid assessment tool for rural and remote Indigenous Australians.

Project management is one of the key competencies that organizations and the government seek to develop to stay relevant and plugged-in to the global community. This research attempts to examine the predictors of project success in the Singapore context. This study uses Pinto's Project Implementation Profile (PIP) instrument as a basis and starting point for further study. It seeks to discover and identify critical success factors (CSFs) in Singaporean project environment. The study also aims to validate whether the PIP, which is commonly used in western societies, is also applicable in the Singapore context. A methodology combining Critical Incident Technique (CIT) has been used to identify possible CSFs, which are subsequently rationalized and validated with the CSFs in the PIP. A questionnaire survey (n= 267), involving project management professionals across several key sectors and industries, provided data for quantitative analysis. Multivariate analyses, which include factor analysis and multiple regression, were applied to identify and validate the CSFs that are significant in predicting project success. The results produce a predictive equation involving five CSFs that are significant in predicting project success in the Singapore context. The study generally supports the applicability of Pinto's PIP in Singapore, although with some differences. It is expected that the findings of this study will provide value to future researchers who are keen to further explore the 'elusive' CSFs of project management. The business community is also expected to leverage on the findings of this study to optimize their scarce project management resources in achieving and sustaining business competencies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical incident technique</field><field name="subject">Management -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Management information systems</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Project management -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Predictors of project success</field><field name="subject">Critical success factors</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0064</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empirical analysis of stock return synchronicity  comparison of developed and emerging markets</field><field name="creator">Khandaker, Sarod</field><field name="description">Abstract   This thesis analyses the stock market synchronicity of 34 emerging markets and compares the findings with seven developed markets. The study uses weekly stock return data and the final dataset includes approximately 20.8 million weekly observations for 40,014 firms across the world.    	Morck et al. (2000) are among the first to introduce the topic of stock market synchronisation and argue that stock markets in economies with high per capita GDP move in a relatively unsynchronised manner over time, in contrast to stock prices in low per capita GDP economies. They also suggest that stock synchronicity is associated with macroeconomic indicators including rule of law, inflation, corruption and geographical size. In addition, Skaife et al. (2006) propose a further measure of stock synchronicity based on the proportion of zero returns and argue that the zero-return measure is a superior measure of stock market co-movement. The study uses both measures proposed by Morck et al. (2000) and one measure proposed by Skaife et al. (2006) for synchronicity analysis and extends the analysis to cover a ten year period, a larger sample of shares and more recent measures of country specific characteristics.   	It is found that stock markets in emerging economies are more synchronous than in developed economies over the sample period using the classical measure. It is also found that over the 10-year study period the synchronicity measure is stationary. There is evidence of a statistically significant negative correlation between stock synchronicity and both government accountability and corruption for the emerging markets using the cross-sectional analysis.   	The R-square measure of stock synchronicity averages 0.091 for the emerging markets and 0.045 for the developed economies, suggesting that higher stock price co-movement is evident in emerging economies. Further, there is a statistically significant positive correlation between the R-square measure and both corruption and inflation.	The study also uses the zero-return measure of stock synchronicity suggested by Skaife et al. (2006). It is found that the zero-return measure for emerging economies is higher than for developed economies. Surprisingly, China and the S&amp;P 500 group of companies exhibit the lowest values for the zero-return measure during this period, which is inconsistent with the classical measure and the R-square measure. Further, panel data analysis shows that GDP per capita and trade openness have a strong effect on the zero-return measure.   	The Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation coefficient indicate that the classical measure and the R-square measure are positively correlated and appear to capture similar aspects of the markets in the study, which is also consistent with cross-sectional analysis results. In contrast, the zero-return measure shows either insignificant or negative correlation with the classical measure and the R-square measure for most sub-period and full period analysis.   	Finally, there is evidence that emerging stock markets are more synchronous over time than in developed financial markets. It is found that common-law country stock synchronicity is lower than in civil-law countries or post-communist countries using the classical measure and the R-square measure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stock markets</field><field name="subject">synchronicity</field><field name="subject">developed economies</field><field name="subject">emerging economies</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090506.092649</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanical Properties and Damage Tolerance of Aerospace Composite Materials Containing CVM Sensors</field><field name="creator">Kousourakis, Asimenia</field><field name="description">The PhD thesis evaluates the mechanical properties and damage tolerance of aerospace carbon/epoxy laminates containing long, narrow interlaminar galleries. The term 'galleries' refers to thin and long holes in a laminate used for the installation of small measuring devices, such as structural health monitoring (SHM) sensors. The galleries considered in this study are similar to those used in a novel SHM system known as 'Comparative Vacuum Monitoring (CVM)'. CVM was developed by the Australian company - Structural Monitoring Systems (SMS) - for damage detection in aircraft structures. CVM is a SHM system that utilises pressure differentials between a parallel series of galleries at atmospheric or low pressure to detect damage initiation and propagation. Thus far, CVM has been used for the monitoring of surface cracks in metallic structures using surface mounted sensors. Recent research has also demonstrated that it may be possible to monitor damage along the bond- line of both metallic and composite joints using CVM.   The ability of CVM sensors to detect delamination damage inside composite structures is less well understood.  It is envisaged that CVM can be used for the through-life health monitoring of composite aircraft structures prone to delamination damage. However, a major concern with applying CVM to composite laminates is the open-hole design of the galleries that may initiate damage growth under external loading. Material property data, structural tests, and models for predicting the properties of laminates containing galleries is needed before CVM technology can be certified for use in aircraft composite structures.   The primary objectives of this PhD thesis are the development of an optimum process method for introducing multiple interlaminar CVM galleries in composite laminates; the development of a validated model for calculating changes to the mechanical properties of laminates containing CVM galleries; and the determination of optimum CVM gallery shape, size and orientation combinations for minimising the effect of the galleries on the mechanical properties of laminates.    The effects of the shape, size and orientation of CVM galleries on the mechanical properties of carbon/epoxy laminates are evaluated by an extensive experimental research program, and the results are presented in the thesis. The properties investigated include the in-plane tensile and compressive properties, tensile and compressive fatigue life, through-thickness tensile strength, interlaminar shear strength, mode I and mode II interlaminar fracture toughness, and impact damage resistance. The results from tensile tests on lap-joints and T-joints containing CVM galleries are also presented.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">structural health monitoring</field><field name="subject">comparative vacuum monitoring</field><field name="subject">composite laminates</field><field name="subject">galleries</field><field name="subject">voids</field><field name="subject">mechanical properties of laminates</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090506.095922</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A DWT Based Perceptual Video Coding Framework - Concepts, Issues and Techniques</field><field name="creator">Mei, Liming</field><field name="description">The work in this thesis explore the DWT based video coding by the introduction of a novel DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) / MC (Motion Compensation) / DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation) video coding framework, which adopts the EBCOT as the coding engine for both the intra- and the inter-frame coder. The adaptive switching mechanism between the frame/field coding modes is investigated for this coding framework. The Low-Band-Shift (LBS) is employed for the MC in the DWT domain. The LBS based MC is proven to provide consistent improvement on the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of the coded video over the simple Wavelet Tree (WT) based MC. The Adaptive Arithmetic Coding (AAC) is adopted to code the motion information. The context set of the Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (ABAC) for the inter-frame data is redesigned based on the statistical analysis. To further improve the perceived picture quality, a Perceptual Distortion Measure (PDM) based on human vi sion model is used for the EBCOT of the intra-frame coder. A visibility assessment of the quantization error of various subbands in the DWT domain is performed through subjective tests. In summary, all these findings have solved the issues originated from the proposed perceptual video coding framework. They include: a working DWT/MC/DPCM video coding framework with superior coding efficiency on sequences with translational or head-shoulder motion; an adaptive switching mechanism between frame and field coding mode; an effective LBS based MC scheme in the DWT domain; a methodology of the context design for entropy coding of the inter-frame data; a PDM which replaces the MSE inside the EBCOT coding engine for the intra-frame coder, which provides improvement on the perceived quality of intra-frames; a visibility assessment to the quantization errors in the DWT domain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DWT</field><field name="subject">Perceptual</field><field name="subject">Arithmetic Coding</field><field name="subject">Context</field><field name="subject">Motion Compensation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090506.103244</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remotely Sustainable</field><field name="creator">Pedersen, Finn Tingleff</field><field name="description">Remotely Sustainable focuses on a specific line of work that could be called 'remote Indigenous architecture'. I define this as architecture for Aboriginal clients who are the traditional owners of their homelands, where these projects are built. This context is critical because the issues I discuss may be relevant to other Indigenous communities in Australia.       However, the customs, culture, bureaucracy and conditions mean I must caution anyone in applying any of these ideas to another community without deep consideration of and good consultation with that community. The context also extends to the broader framework of federal and state governance. As architects and citizens it seems there is little we can do to impact on these systems, but if the government and agencies do not make appropriate decisions, there is little chance of improving the outcomes for Aboriginal people.       Working in this field as an architect is extremely hard. There are almost insurmountable problems that arise from ineffective government agencies, difficulties in communicating with clients, extreme distances to travel, physical discomfort to be endured and very little in the way of fees to perform these tasks. The difficulties begin at the consultancy stage and continue throughout the project until occupation by the clients. There is great difficulty in ensuring that the builders and tradespeople do their jobs properly and ensuring they return to sites to fix defective work is problematic. The budgets allocated to Indigenous housing projects are often well below that required to produce buildings that satisfy the clients' needs and expectations. Finally, there is little appreciation of the work that architects do in these communities, possibly because in some cases architects do their job badly.       This Master of Architecture Project uses case study buildings by iredale pedersen hook architects to reveal some of the difficulties faced when delivering these projects, in order to encourage the development of better solutions in the future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Reflective Practice</field><field name="subject">Architectural Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090506.140845</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and function of esterases from lactic acid bacteria : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosphy in the Institute of Molecular BioSciences, Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Matthew David</field><field name="description">Compounds derived from the breakdown of glyceride esters of milk fat, such as free fatty acids and short chain esters, are recognised as playing an important role in the flavour of a range of fermented foods. Esterases, capable of hydrolysing ester bonds, and in some cases, synthesising them via an acyltransferase mechanism, typically enter the fermentation from the starter and adjunct lactic acid bacteria that are used to inoculate milk to initiate the fermentation process. With such an important role in the development of both desirable and undesirable flavours, understanding how these enzymes operate is essential for product control. In this study, the crystal structures of three lactic acid bacterial esterases were solved: EstA from Lactococcus lactis, and AA7 from Lactobacillus rhamnosus which are both capable of hydrolysis of short chain triglycerides as well as synthesising esters via a transferase mechanism, and AZ4, an esterase from L. rhamnosus which appears to be limited to hydrolysis reactions. Whilst all three were found to be members of the    hydrolase family, unique features were found for each enzyme, reflecting the large differences in their primary sequences, substrate specificities and activities. EstA and AA7 were both found to have a shallow substrate binding cleft, bisected by the catalytic machinery. The divided binding cleft suggests that during a transferase reaction the transferred group binds in one pocket, with the donor and acceptor groups (dependant on the stage of catalysis) binding in the other. In contrast, AZ4 was found to have a single deep substrate binding cavity, extending into the enzyme interior, with the catalytic residues located near its entrance. The absence of a second binding site for an acceptor is consistent with AZ4 having only one function &#8211; that of a hydrolase. The structures presented in this study are the first three dimensional structures of esterases from lactic acid bacteria to be reported. Their analyses, both in native form, and complexed with a varity of ligands mimicking various stages of the reaction cycle have highlighted how this basic fold can be adapted to efficiently catalyse different reactions. More importantly, in the case of AZ4, these structures have suggested that there is a novel mechanism used by the esterases to promote the enzyme reaction to proceed to completion, by preventing a futile catalytic reaction.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lactic acid</field><field name="subject">milk</field><field name="subject">esterases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270109 Structural biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/810</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomous agents in a dynamic collaborative environment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sen Gupta, Gourab</field><field name="description">The proliferation of robots in industry and every day human life is gaining momentum. After the initial few decades of employment of robots in the industry, especially the automotive assembly plants, robots are now entering the home and offices. From being pick-and-place manipulators, robots are slowly being transformed in shape and form to be more anthropomorphic. The wheeled robots are however here to stay for the foreseeable future until such time as artificial muscles, and efficient means to control them, are well developed. The next phase of development of robots will be for the service industry. Robots will cooperate with each other to accomplish collaborative tasks to aid human life. They will also collaborate with human beings to assist them in doing tasks such as lifting loads and moving objects. At the same time, with the advancement of hardware, robots are becoming very fast and are capable of being programmed with more intelligence. Coupled with this is the availability of sophisticated sensors with which the robots can perceive the real world around them. Combinations of these factors have created many challenging areas of research. Several factors affect the performance of robots in a dynamic collaborative environment. The research presented in this thesis has identified the major contributing factors, namely fast vision processing, behaviour programming, predictive movement and interception control, and precise motion control, that collectively have influence on the performance of robots which are engaged in a collaborative effort to accomplish a task. Several novel techniques have been proposed in this thesis to enhance the collective performance of collaborating robots. In many systems, vision is used as one of the sensory inputs for the robot&#8217;s perception of the environment. This thesis describes a new colour space and the use of discrete look-up-tables (LUT) for very fast and robust colour segmentation and real-time identification of objects in the robot&#8217;s work space. A distributed camera system and a stereo vision using a single camera are reported. Advanced filtering has been applied to the vision data for predictive identification of the position and orientation of moving robots and targets, and for anticipatory interception control. Collaborative tasks are generally complex and robots need to be capable of exhibiting sophisticated behaviours. This thesis has detailed the use of State Transition Based Control (STBC) methodology to build a hierarchy of complex behaviour. Behaviour of robots in a robot soccer game and features such as role selection and obstacle avoidance have been built using STBC. A novel methodology for advanced control of fast robots is detailed. The algorithm uses a combination of Triangular Targeting Algorithm (TTA) and Proximity Positioning Algorithm (PPA) to position a robot behind an object aligned with a target. Various forms of velocity profiling have been proposed and validated with substantial test results. The thesis ends by looking at future scenarios where robots and human beings will coexist and work together to do many collaborative tasks. Anthropomorphic robots will be more prevalent in future and teleoperation will gain momentum. Throughout the thesis, the engineering applicability of proposed algorithms and architectures have been emphasised by testing on real robots.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/811</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">He whakaturanga mo te hauora tamariki : a picture of child health : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Waldon, John Allan</field><field name="description">This research investigated the use of a self administrated health assessment questionnaire by children, and the significance of the translation from the source instrument (in English) into te reo Maori. The translation of a child health questionnaire was undertaken to produce a health survey tool that could be completed by a child over the age of 8 years in English or in te reo Maori. The questionnaire was pre-tested then used in a survey to determine both reliability and validity. The parents and caregivers of the children surveyed were also interviewed. The parent&#8217;s responses were compared with those of their children. The research undertaken has provided a new opportunity for children to take a central role in research into their own health. Children contributed as key experts, focus group participants and translators of the child questionnaire, alongside adults in some cases. Children provided a new perspective of their health and well-being by translating the questionnaire. This child-centred process added depth to the research of questionnaire validation and testing. The questionnaire was shown to perform adequately as a survey tool. New research is required in order to theorise beyond the questionnaire&#8217;s original two-factor conceptual model and to develop clinical and public health applications using a child-centred research process. The translation provided by the children demonstrated they are informed participants, who have an interest in their own health, are reliable and understand their health in a different manner to adults. This thesis argues that the direct and full involvement of participants in research that is designed to investigate their health is critical if new knowledge is to emerge.

Therefore, the thesis titled, &#8220;Real-time adaptive beamformer for Automatic speech Recognition in a car environment&#8221; presents an application technique of a beamforming method and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) method. In this thesis, a novel solution is presented to the question as below, namely: How can the driver&#8217;s voice control the car using ASR? The solution in this thesis is an ASR using a hybrid system with acoustic beamforming Voice Activity Detector (VAD) and an Adaptive Wiener Filter. The beamforming approach is based on a fundamental theory of normalized least-mean squares (NLMS) to improve Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The microphone has been implemented with a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) which uses time-delay estimation together with magnitude-squared coherence (MSC). An experiment clearly shows the ability of the composite system to reduce noise outside of a defined active zone. In real-time environments a speech recognition system in a car has to receive the driver&#8217;s voice only whilst suppressing background noise e.g. voice from radio. Therefore, this research presents a hybrid real-time adaptive filter which operates within a geometrical zone defined around the head of the desired speaker. Any sound outside of this zone is considered to be noise and suppressed. As this defined geometrical zone is small, it is assumed that only driver's speech is incoming from this zone. The technique uses three microphones to define a geometric based voice-activity detector (VAD) to cancel the unwanted speech coming from outside of the zone. In the case of a sole unwanted speech incoming from outside of a desired zone, this speech is muted at the output of the hybrid noise canceller. In case of an unwanted speech and a desired speech are incoming at the same time, the proposed VAD fails to identify the unwanted speech or desired speech. In such a situation an adaptive Wiener filter is switched on for noise reduction, where the SNR is improved by as much as 28dB. In order to identify the signal quality of the filtered signal from Wiener filter, a template matching speech recognition system that uses a Wiener filter is designed for testing. In this thesis, a commercial speech recognition system is also applied to test the proposed beamforming based noise cancellation and the adaptive Wiener filter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">speech processing sytems</field><field name="subject">noise suppression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299903 Biosensor technolgies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/812</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of active packaging systems for horticultural products : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Packaging Technology at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Utto, Weerawate</field><field name="description">Active packaging systems can offer significant advantages in preventing quality loss in horticultural products through control of microbial and/or physiological activity. By delivering and sustaining volatile active agents at effective levels in a package atmosphere, significant shelf life extension can thus be achieved. Design of these systems is complicated by the number of possible package, product, active agent and carrier combinations that can be employed and the significant interactions that may occur between these components. Mathematical modelling can be used to simplify system design and reduce the number of experimental trials required to achieve optimal active packaging systems. In this study a generalised modelling methodology was developed and validated to facilitate the design of active controlled volatile release packaging systems for horticultural products. The modelling methodology was developed using an example system which comprised tomatoes packed under a modified atmosphere (MA; 5 % (v/v) CO2 and 10 % (v/v) O2) in a LDPE bag with a polymer film sealed sachet containing silica gel pre-saturated with the antifungal agent hexanal. Experimental trials showed that for this system a target sustained hexanal concentration of 40-70 ppm was required. This was shown to be (i) the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for controlling Botrytis cinerea growing on tomatoes stored at 20&#176;C and ~99%RH, (ii) to have only a relatively minor influence on the postharvest quality of tomatoes under these active MA conditions, and (iii) to promote only a small apparent uptake of hexanal from the atmosphere by the tomatoes. The effective hexanal permeabilities of Tyvek , LDPE and OPP sachet films were characterised using the isostatic method and shown to exhibit a dependence on both temperature (10 and 20&#176;C) and concentration (over a range of 0.01-0.22 mol m[superscript -3). Average permeabilities decreased in the order of Tyvek  &gt; LDPE &gt; OPP, respectively, at all temperatures at comparable hexanal partial pressures. Hexanal sorption isotherms for silica gel at both 10 and 20&#186;C were determined using the gravimetric method and were reasonably well described by the Langmuir equation. The equilibrium amount adsorbed was significantly reduced at the higher temperature but the pre-adsorption of water vapour on hexanal uptake on silica gel showed no uniform trend on the sorption characteristics suggesting that multicomponent sorption is complex. A generalised modelling methodology was developed through conceptualising key mass transfer processes involved in these active MA packaging systems. Quantitative methods for deciding the relative importance of each process were established together with guidelines for when simplifying assumptions could be made. This information was formalised into a decision tree to allow appropriate assumptions to be made in model formulation without unacceptable loss of model accuracy. Methods to develop generalised equations from these assumptions to describe changes in the sachet, package headspace and outer bag film with respect to an active agent and MA gases were then identified. The mathematical modelling methodology was applied to the example hexanal release active MAP tomato packaging system. For these systems there was a high initial peak in package headspace concentration during the first 24 h which declined to a quasi steadystate concentration over a period of days. The quasi steady-state headspace concentrations were generally in the MIC range and were well predicted by the model. Interactions between water vapour and silica gel may have been responsible for the relatively higher hexanal concentration at the onset of release from the Tyvek  sachet (a highly porous material). However the influence of water vapour (&gt;95% RH in the MA bag containing tomatoes) during the quasi steady-state period appeared to be insignificant for all sachet films. The model was successfully applied to a range of packaging configurations and storage temperatures. A lack of fit was evident between model predictions and experimental trials during the initial (unsteady-state) stages of the release pattern for both headspace vapour concentrations and adsorbed mass on the silica gel. These differences were attributed to (i) model input uncertainties, chiefly with regard to the estimated coefficients of both the Langmuir isotherm equation and film permeability, and (ii) overestimated effective permeability values predicted by extrapolation of the concentration dependence of film permeability beyond the conditions for which the permeability was measured. These results suggest improved models for the effective permeabilities of the films, quantified under a range of vapour concentrations and concentration gradients, are required for better describing fluxes across the sachet film. Despite these limitations, the model did describe the general release pattern. The model was then used to pose a range of &#8216;what-if&#8217; scenarios investigating the release patterns predicted for different active packaging designs. This analysis gave useful insights into how sorption isotherm shape and package/sachet design parameters can be manipulated to achieve different volatile release platforms. The work clearly demonstrated the importance of accurate data for permeability of volatile compounds through polymer films and for sorption of the active agent on the carrier phase. More work on characterising these systems is recommended to further improve modelbased design methods for active MAP systems. Overall the generalised methodology developed can be confidently adopted for constructing a mathematical model that provides sufficient accuracy and simplicity to be implemented for designing active packaging systems for horticultural and food products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active packaging systems</field><field name="subject">horticultural products</field><field name="subject">packaging technology</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300304 Post harvest technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/824</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The anatomy of a customer relationship management (CRM) initiative : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Customer Relationship Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Troy, Virgil</field><field name="description">Much has been written in the field of Customer Relationship Management (CRM). Current literature has focused on various industries such as telecommunications, hospitality, banking, finance, insurance etc; nothing has been investigated within New Zealand&#8217;s electricity lines companies and very little has been undertaken academically within New Zealand. This thesis explores for the first time The Anatomy of a CRM Initiative within an electricity lines company; a phenomenon which until recently was inaccessible to scientific investigation. The researcher also breaks new ground by empirically measuring for the first time CRM processes and practices from a New Zealand organisational perspective. CRM is based on three central assumptions that (1) customers want a relationship with suppliers of products or services, (2) CRM is a process or practice that all organisations to some degree either engage or should engage in, and that (3) good CRM increases the level of emotional bond between customer and supplier. As a result of undertaking this research, the researcher came to the conclusion that these assumptions may be fundamentally flawed. In the context of the single case study organisation, the researcher found that few customers wanted an active relationship with their supplier and the extent of these relationships varied across segments; up until this research, previous authors had suggested this scenario existed based on anecdotal evidence alone. From a case study, lines company industry and wider New Zealand organisational perspective, not all organisations demonstrated processes and practices were in place to proactively engage with their customers. Finally the research showed that the emotional bond between customers and the case study organisation is essentially the antithesis of traditional loyalty marketing which suggests that stronger emotional bonds are fostered based on good or excellent service. The researcher found evidence to suggest that, from a lines company perspective, emotional bonds are driven by poor quality rather than good quality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">customer relationship management</field><field name="subject">electricity lines companies</field><field name="subject">organisational perspective</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350600 Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/820</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flight of the kiwi : an exploration of motives and behaviours of self-initiated mobility : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thorn, Kaye Jennifer</field><field name="description">The&#160;primary&#160;aim&#160;of&#160;this&#160;study&#160;was&#160;to&#160;identify&#160;the&#160;motives&#160;for&#160;self-initiated&#160;mobility&#160;of&#160;highly&#160;educated&#160;New&#160;Zealanders&#160;across&#160;national&#160;boundaries.&#160;It&#160;further&#160;seeks&#160;to&#160;identify&#160;the&#160;relative&#160;importance&#160;of&#160;these&#160;motives&#160;and&#160;to&#160;explore&#160;relationships&#160;between&#160;motivation&#160;and&#160;mobiity&#160;behaviour.&#160;&#160;This&#160;study&#160;on&#160;self-initiated&#160;mobility&#160;is&#160;opportune&#160;as&#160;an&#160;increasingly&#160;globalised&#160;market&#160;place&#160;and&#160;a&#160;demand&#160;for&#160;the&#160;skills&#160;of&#160;the&#160;highly&#160;educated&#160;rsult&#160;in&#160;competition&#160;for&#160;workers. &#160;&#160;&#160;

This research introduces an approach for the assessment of the sustainability of farming systems. It is based on the premises that sustainability has an environmental bottom line and that there is very limited substitutability between natural capital and other forms of capital. Sustainability assessment is undertaken through analyses of energy and material flows of the system and their impacts on the environment. The proposed sustainability assessment approach is based on two high level criteria for sustainability: efficient use of energy and non-degradation of the environment from energy and material use. Sustainability assessment of organic orchard systems in New Zealand was undertaken to demonstrate this approach. Five indicators which address the two criteria for the sustainability of the orchard systems are the energy ratio, the CO2 ratio, changes in the soil carbon level, nutrient balances, and the leaching of nitrogen. Organic kiwifruit and organic apple systems are modelled based on their key energy and material flows and their interactions with the natural environment. The energy and material flows are converted into appropriate energy and matter equivalents based on coefficients taken from the published literature. Sustainability indicators are estimated over one growing season using two computer modelling tools, Overseer&#174; and Stella&#174;, in a life cycle approach. Sustainability assessment of the organic orchard systems suggests that the approach is useful for evaluating energy use and key environmental impacts that occur in soil, water and atmosphere. The results indicate that the model organic orchard systems are sustainable in terms of energy use and are a net sink of CO2-equivalent emissions. The implication of this result is that organic orchard systems potentially could trade carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol. The findings also suggest that the sustainability assessment approach is capable of identifying the trade-offs within the sustainability indicators associated with particular management practices. Further research to improve and validate the proposed approach is essential, before it can be practically used for decision making at the orchard level and for policy making at the national level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainability assessment</field><field name="subject">energy use</field><field name="subject">environmental impact</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300399 Horticulture not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/825</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The future of personal area networks in a ubiquitous computing world : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Sciences in Information Systems at Massey University at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Fei</field><field name="description">In the future world of ubiquitous computing, wireless devices will be everywhere.

The most commonly characterised is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Produced when nutrients are growth limiting and carbon available in excess, PHA serves as a carbon-energy storage material and forms generally spherical insoluble inclusions between 50-500nm in diameter in the cytoplasm. The key enzyme for PHA synthesis is the PHA synthase and this enzyme catalyses the polymerisation of (R)-3-hydroxy fatty acids into PHA. PHA synthase remains covalently attached to the growing polyester chain and is displayed on the surface of the PHA granule. Other proteins associated with PHA granules include depolymerases for mobilisation or degradation of granules, regulatory proteins and phasins, proteins that aid in PHA granule stability. PHA bio-beads displaying an IgG binding protein were produced and used to purify IgG from serum demonstrating that the PHA synthase can be engineered to display functional synthase fusion proteins at the PHA granule surface. Correctly folded eukaryotic proteins were also produced and displayed at the PHA granule surface as phasin fusion proteins. Multiple-functionality was also achievable by co-expression of various hybrid genes suggesting that this biotechnological bead production strategy might represent a versatile platform technology. The production of functional eukaryotic proteins at the PHA bead surface represents a novel in vivo matrix-assisted protein folding system. Protein engineering of PHA granule surface proteins provides a novel molecular tool for the display of antigens for FACS based analysis and offers promising possibilities in the development of future biotechnological production processes. Overall, the results obtained in this study strongly enhance the applied potential of these polyester beads in biotechnology and medicine.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recombinant Escherichia coli</field><field name="subject">bio-polyester beads</field><field name="subject">bio-beads</field><field name="subject">polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)</field><field name="subject">polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)</field><field name="subject">protein engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270306 Microbial genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/818</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motherhood and the 'Plunket Book' : a social history : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clendon, Jillian Margaret</field><field name="description">The Well Child/Tamariki Ora Health Book (the Plunket book) is a small booklet given to New Zealand mothers on the birth of a child. It has been used by nurses as a tool to record growth and development from birth to five years since the 1920s. Although use of the book decreases over time, it is frequently kept within the family and handed on from mother to child. Utilising an oral history approach, this study has traced the development of the Plunket book over time and explored the experiences of a group of 34 women and one man who have reflected on their ownership of, or involvement with, Plunket books. The study found that the Plunket book remains an effective clinical tool for mothers and nurses. Mothers have used the book as a tool to link past with present, to maintain kinship ties across generations, to deal with change intergenerationally, and in a manner that contributes to their self-identity as woman and mother. Although mothers were able to use the book to affirm their own knowledge and that of their mothers, a medically dominated discourse persists in the book. The book has also played a role in facilitating the interaction between mother and nurse, providing an opportunity to explore the relationship in detail. The study found that the most successful relationships at any time were those that bordered the division between a professional relationship and a personal one: it was not the information that nurses offered but the interaction and resulting care they provided that was important to the mothers in the study. The study recommends that nurses and other health professionals continue to use the Plunket book as a clinical tool mindful of the fact that the book remains in use beyond the health professional&#8217;s immediate involvement with the mother and child, playing an important role in the context of the New Zealand family across generations. Future versions of the book should contain written reference to the strengths and abilities the mother holds as she cares for her child, reaffirming her role and identity as mother not only when her children are younger but as they grow and become parents themselves.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mother-nurse interaction</field><field name="subject">kinship</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321209 Family care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/826</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What underpins success in a health promoting school in Northeastern Thailand? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Chamusri, Somsaowanuch</field><field name="description">A Health Promoting School (HPS) approach is now widely accepted internationally, with a focus on children&#8217;s health, the school curriculum, and whole school environment. In Thailand, the health and well-being of children is a fundamental value. HPS programmes have been implemented in schools as a strategy to focus on young people&#8217;s health. A number of barriers to successful HPS have been identified. While there is international evidence to show the steps and the key factors in creating successful HPS, little is known about successful HPS in the Thai context, in particular, in Northeastern Thailand which has been classified the poorest region. Ethnographic methods were used to examine what understanding of the meaning of HPS is necessary for a successful school, and how all those involved acted from the adoption of the HPS programmes by the local school until it achieved HPS status. A rural school which was successful in a HPS programme was selected, in Mahasarakham province, Northeastern Thailand. The data were obtained through participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and ethnographic records, and data analysis took place simultaneously with data collection. In this study, Lofland&#8217;s strategy for the analysis of the structure of human interaction was used. A variety of techniques for improving and documenting the credibility of the study such as prolonged engagement, persistent observation, and triangulation were used. This research revealed that the informants&#8217; views reflected diverse understandings of the meaning of HPS. Those views were based on their experiences of HPS which differed according to the degree of participation, different levels of knowledge about HPS, and in the roles they played in the implementation of HPS in the school. Thai culture and school ethos influenced the success of HPS. Community participation was also crucial in supporting the school&#8217;s achievement. Key factors that underpinned success are identified. Implications of the findings for the HPS programme, health professionals, the school and community are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child health</field><field name="subject">health promoting school</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/817</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validity of business excellence models : a conceptual and empirical analysis : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jayamaha, Nihal P</field><field name="description">The validity of three key Business Excellence (BE) models used in the Asia Pacific&#8212;the Australian Business Excellence Framework (Australia), the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence (New Zealand) and the Singapore Quality Award Criteria (Singapore)&#8212;was examined from a conceptual as well as a predictive standpoint. Unlike in many past studies, in this study the validity of the measurement criteria stipulated in BE models have been directly assessed. The conceptual validity of the three BE models was studied through a generic theoretical model using the partial least squares-based structural equation modelling (PLSBSEM) method. Apart from measurement validity, the strengths of the hypothesised causal relationships between the constructs of the BE models and their practical implementations were also examined under conceptual validity. The predictive validity of the three BE models was examined through linear predictive models involving enablers&#8212;being measures in BE models that cover what organisations actually do in order to achieve business outcomes&#8212;as predictors and business outcomes as responses. Alongside predictive validity, the reasonableness of the stipulated weights of the enablers was also examined. Other empirical and pragmatic inquiries covered in this study included: (a) a study of the effect of &#8220;industry attractiveness&#8221; on financial and market performance, and (b) a study of the relationship between BE constructs and &#8220;national cultural dimensions&#8221;. Results revealed that although the three BE models fulfilled the basic requirements of measurement validity, against more stringent criteria such as those used in psychometrics, they showed low levels of validity. The possible reasons for this were examined and the ways of overcoming the shortcoming were suggested. The generic theoretical model was found to be statistically significant across all three settings: Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. As regards predictive validity, it was observed that enablers appear to be good predictors of business outcomes (thus establishing predictive validity) although there was scope for improvement of the existing weighting scheme of the enablers. This study is important because many organisations in the region use BE models with the expectation of improving their performance in key results areas and hence there is a need to demonstrate that the BE models are based on sound concepts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business outcomes</field><field name="subject">enablers</field><field name="subject">measurement validity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/827</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postmodern orientalism : William Gibson, cyberpunk and Japan : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in English at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Leonard Patrick</field><field name="description">Taking the works of William Gibson as its point of focus, this thesis considers cyberpunk&#8217;s expansion from an emphatically literary moment in the mid 1980s into a broader multimedia cultural phenomenon. It examines the representation of racial differences, and the formulation of global economic spaces and flows which structure the reception and production of cultural practices. These developments are construed in relation to ongoing debates around Japan&#8217;s identity and otherness in terms of both deviations from and congruities with the West (notably America). To account for these developments, this thesis adopts a theoretical framework informed by both postmodernism as the &#8220;cultural dominant&#8221; of late capitalism (Jameson), and orientalism, those discursive structures which produce the reified polarities of East versus West (Said). Cyberpunk thus exhibits the characteristics of an orientalised postmodernism, as it imagines a world in which multinational corporations characterised as Japanese zaibatsu control global economies, and the excess of accumulated garbage is figured in the trope of gomi. It is also postmodernised orientalism, in its nostalgic reconstruction of scenes from the residue of imperialism, its deployment of figures of &#8220;cross-ethnic representation&#8221; (Chow) like the Eurasian, and its expressions of a purely fantasmatic experience of the Orient, as in the evocation of cyberspace. In distinction from modern or Saidean orientalism, postmodern orientalism not only allows but is characterized by reciprocal causality. This describes uneven, paradoxical, interconnected and mutually implicated cultural transactions at the threshold of East-West relations. The thesis explores this by first examining cyberpunk&#8217;s unremarked relationship with countercultural formations (rock music), practices (drugs) and manifestations of Oriental otherness in popular culture. The emphasis in the remainder of the thesis shifts towards how cyberpunk maps new technologies onto physical and imaginative &#8220;bodies&#8221; and geographies: the figuration of the cyborg, prosthetic interventions, and the evolution of cyberspace in tandem with multimedia innovations such as videogames. Cyberpunk then can best be understood as a conjunction of seemingly disparate experiences: on the one hand the postmodern dislocations and vertiginous moments of estrangement offset by instances of intense connectivity in relation to the virtual, the relocation to the &#8220;distanceless home&#8221; of cyberspace. As such it is an ever-expanding phenomenon which has been productively fused with other youth-culture media, and one with specifically Japanese features (anime, visual kei, and virtual idols).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">William Gibson</field><field name="subject">cyberpunk</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">Canadian literature</field><field name="subject">science fiction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420206 North American</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/816</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphology, phylogeography and drumming behaviour of a New Zealand ground weta, Hemiandrus pallitarsis : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chappell, Esta Monique</field><field name="description">Species are one of the fundamental components of biology and the accurate delimitation of species is important in evolutionary, systematic and ecological studies, yet there is still confusion over how species can be recognised. Examining different characters allows multiple lines of evidence for successful and accurate species delimitation and identification. In this thesis, morphological, genetic and behavioural variation is investigated within an endemic species of ground weta, Hemiandrus pallitarsis, in the North Island, New Zealand. Twelve morphological characters were measured, and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I DNA sequences were analysed from populations across the distributional range of H. pallitarsis. Both methods provide no evidence of a species complex within H. pallitarsis. Instead, the morphometric results suggest females are significantly larger than males, and ground weta in Palmerston North are significantly smaller than weta further north. Additionally, genetic analyses found substantial population structuring, large genetic distances, and an historical south to north pattern of movement in the North Island. The pattern of vibratory drumming behaviour followed that predicted by morphology and geographic proximity &#8211; drumming signals were more similar between geographically close populations and did not match the patterns of genetic isolation.

Ordained priest for the Colonies in 1819, he arrived in Sydney, New South Wales, in January 1820 and shortly after commenced work as Assistant Chaplain at Parramatta in the role of locum tenens for the Reverend Samuel Marsden. In 1821 he was appointed to the convict settlement of Newcastle, where, over the ensuing five and a half years he found himself in constant conflict with both the military and ecclesiastical authorities because of his perceived absenteesim and his agricultural dealings.  His conflict with the Commandant of Newcastle, Major James Morisset, originated from his perceived interference in, and condemnation of, Morisset&#8217;s disregard for the Sabbath and Christian morality. Relations between the two men broke down completely and Middleton found himself criticised from the Governor down and very much isolated. In 1825, Archdeacon Thomas Hobbes Scott, a former secretary to Sir Thomas Bigge during Bigge&#8217;s enquiry into the state of New South Wales, arrived in Sydney and commenced the first structural organisation of the antipodean Anglican Church. Almost immediately relations between Scott and Middleton deteriorated to the point where, in 1827, Middleton resigned and moved to his land grant at Paterson, about 70 kilometres from Newcastle. Scholars since then have incorrectly seen the main cause of their conflict as Middleton&#8217;s perceived absenteeism, unaware that far greater differences existed. To Scott, Middleton was an incompetent administrator, a lax pastor and unfit for ministry.  After resigning, Middleton acted as a pastor, farmer, Justice of the Peace and community member until 1832, when, forced by drought, he moved to Sydney where he established a school by which to support himself and his family.  In 1836, William Grant Broughton, formerly the Archdeacon of Australia, and later the first and only Bishop of Australia, returned from England, and in 1837, licensed Middleton to the parish of Butterwick and Seaham. There Middleton served as pastor until his early death in 1848.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">priests</field><field name="subject">Newcastle</field><field name="subject">chaplains</field><field name="subject">convicts</field><field name="subject">Paterson</field><field name="subject">George Augustus Middleton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24872</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Olfactory progenitor cell transplantation into the mammalian inner ear</field><field name="creator">Patel, Nirmal Praful, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">A practical consideration in the development of cellular therapy technology for the inner ear is the development of an in vitro model for assessing the optimal conditions for successful application of cells. The first part of this thesis describes the adaptation of the cochleovestibular structure harvested from P1 mouse pups for analysis of factors critical for the optimal implantation of stem cells in the inner ear. Results of these studies establish that the c17.2 neural stem cell line can be introduced into the cochleovestibular structure in vitro. Using this model, c17.2 cells demonstrated survival predominantly within the vestibule and basal spiral ganglion regions. Furthermore, the addition of the ototoxin, cisplatin and the neurotrophin, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Growth Factor (BDNF) enhanced the survival and migration/dispersion of c17.2 cells within the cochleovestibular explant. The second part of this thesis examines the hypothesis that olfactory neurosphere (ONS) and progenitor cells harvested from the olfactory epithelium represent a viable source of graft material for potential therapeutic applications in the inner ear. Olfactory epithelium represents a unique source of pluripotent cells that may serve as either homografts or autografts. The feasibility of ONSs to survive and integrate into a mammalian cochlea in vivo was assessed. The ONSs were isolated as a crude fraction from the olfactory epithelium of P1 to P3 day old swiss webster mouse pups, ubiquitously expressing the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) marker. The ONSs were microinjected into the cochleae of adult CD1 male mice. Four weeks following their implantation, ONS cells expressing the GFP marker and stained by Nestin were identified in all areas of the cochlea and vestibule, including the spiral ganglion. Robust survival and growth of the implanted ONS and ONS derived cells in the cochlea also included the development of ???tumor-like??? clusters, a phenomenon not observed in control animals implanted with c17.2 neural stem cells. Collectively, the results of this thesis illustrate the potential of olfactory neurosphere and progenitor cells to survive in the inner ear and expose a potential harmful effect of their transplantation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labyrinth (Ear) - Therapy</field><field name="subject">Cellular therapy - Animal models</field><field name="subject">Neural stem cells - Transplantation - Animal models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26180</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mitigating predictive uncertainty in hydroclimatic forecasts: impact of uncertain inputs and model structural form</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Shahadat Hossain, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hydrologic and climate models predict variables through a simplification of the underlying complex natural processes. Model development involves minimising predictive uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty arises from three broad sources which are measurement error in observed responses, uncertainty of input variables and model structural error. This thesis introduces ways to improve predictive accuracy of hydroclimatic models by considering input and structural uncertainties. The specific methods developed to reduce the uncertainty because of erroneous inputs and model structural errors are outlined below.  The uncertainty in hydrological model inputs, if ignored, introduces systematic biases in the parameters estimated. This thesis presents a method, known as simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), to ascertain the extent of parameter bias. SIMEX starts by generating a series of alternate inputs by artificially adding white noise in increasing multiples of the known input error variance. The resulting alternate parameter sets allow formulation of an empirical relationship between their values and the level of noise present. SIMEX is based on the theory that the trend in alternate parameters can be extrapolated back to the notional error free zone. The case study relates to erroneous sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) records used as input variables of a linear model to predict the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). SIMEX achieves a reduction in residual errors from the SOI prediction. Besides, a hydrologic application of SIMEX is demonstrated by a synthetic simulation within a three-parameter conceptual rainfall runoff model.  This thesis next advocates reductions of structural uncertainty of any single model by combining multiple alternative model responses. Current approaches for combining hydroclimatic forecasts are generally limited to using combination weights that remain static over time. This research develops a methodology for combining forecasts from multiple models in a dynamic setting as an improvement of over static weight combination. The model responses are mixed on a pair wise basis using mixing weights that vary in time reflecting the persistence of individual model skills. The concept is referred here as the pair wise dynamic weight combination. Two approaches for forecasting the dynamic weights are developed. The first of the two approaches uses a mixture of two basis distributions which are three category ordered logistic regression model and a generalised linear autoregressive model. The second approach uses a modified nearest neighbour approach to forecast the future weights. These alternatives are used to first combine a univariate response forecast, the NINO3.4 SSTA index. This is followed by a similar combination, but for the entire global gridded SSTA forecast field. Results from these applications show significant improvements being achieved due to the dynamic model combination approach. The last application demonstrating the dynamic combination logic, uses the dynamically combined multivariate SSTA forecast field as the basis of developing multi-site flow forecasts in the Namoi River catchment in eastern Australia. To further reduce structural uncertainty in the flow forecasts, three forecast models are formulated and the dynamic combination approach applied again. The study demonstrates that improved SSTA forecast (due to dynamic combination) in turn improves all three flow forecasts, while the dynamic combination of the three flow forecasts results in further improvements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamic weight</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Model combination</field><field name="subject">Input error</field><field name="subject">SIMEX</field><field name="subject">Flow forecast</field><field name="subject">Sea surface temperature</field><field name="subject">NINO3.4</field><field name="subject">Mixture regression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43378</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sydney's caravan parks:  Community and closure</field><field name="creator">Wedgwood, Kate, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although typically associated with the provision of low-cost holiday accommodation, for over 30 years city-based caravan parks have provided an unrecognised source of permanent housing to the lower end of the market.  Due to their often dilapidated condition and the demographic profile of their residents, caravan parks do not fit within the Australian housing ideal and are often considered enclaves of despondency. Residents are subject to harsh stereotypes and are often referred to as ??trailer trash?? ?? a tag which originated in the USA. However the reality is that caravan parks provide significant social benefits and are unique living environments for their permanent residents. This research involved an extensive discourse analysis complemented by in-depth interviews with caravan park residents and industry stakeholders, which found that the residential experience is typically based on solidarity, companionship, pride and a true sense of belonging.  As urban land prices in Australia have increased exponentially and the footprints of its capital cities continue to grow, large parcels of under-developed land accommodating caravan parks have become ??land banks?? ripe for redevelopment. While it is the park owner??s prerogative to maximise profit, individuals and households are being displaced with little or no compensation, to make way for more lucrative land uses. With deficiencies in the public housing system and the failure of the housing market to provide an adequate level of low-cost accommodation, caravan park residents face an uncertain future, even homelessness. However, the understated impact of this trend is the social implications which affect some of the community??s most vulnerable members. The loss of home, community disintegration and feelings of insecurity appear to be disregarded in the planning process, and this trend seems certain to continue with a lack of responsibility and strategic vision by the government. For this reason, the continued closure of Sydney??s caravan parks should not be tolerated for the purpose of land profiteering. A comprehensive all-of-government and industry response is urgently required to address the threats to Sydney??s caravan parks and to develop mitigation strategies aimed at reducing the resultant outcomes for their vulnerable residents.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Low-cost housing</field><field name="subject">Caravan parks</field><field name="subject">Mobile homes</field><field name="subject">Social impacts of development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43404</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping recursive functions to reconfigurable hardware</field><field name="creator">Ferizis, George, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Reconfigurable computing is a method of development that provides a developer with the ability to reprogram a hardware device. In the specific case of FPGAs this allows for rapid and cost effective implementation of hardware devices when compared to standard a ASIC design, coupled with an increase in performance when compared to software based solutions. With the advent of development tools such as Celoxica's DK package and Xilinx's Forge package, that support languages traditionally associated with software development, a change in the skill sets required to develop FPGA solutions from hardware designers to software programmers is possible and perhaps desirable to increase the adoption of FPGA technologies. To support developers with these skill sets tools should closely mirror current software development tools in terms of language, syntax and methodology, while at the same time both transparently and automatically take advantage of as much of the increased performance that reconfigurable architectures can provide over traditional software architectures by utilizing the parallelism and the ability to create arbitrary depth pipelines which is not present in traditional microprocessor designs.         A common feature of many programming languages that is not supported by many higher level design tools is recursion. Recursion is a powerful method used to elegantly describe many algorithms. Recursion is typically implemented by using a stack to store arguments, context and a return address for function calls. This however limits the controlling hardware to running only a single function at any moment which eliminates an algorithm's ability to take advantage of the parallelism available between successive iterations of a recursive function. This squanders the high amount of parallelism provided by the resources on the FPGA thus reducing the performance of the recursive algorithm.         This thesis presents a method to address the lack of support for recursion in design tools that exploits the parallelism available between recursive calls. It does this by unrolling the recursion into a pipeline, in a similar manner to the pipeline obtained from loop unrolling, and then streaming the data through the resulting pipeline. However essential differences between loops and recursive functions such as multiple recursive calls in a function, and hence multiple unrollings, and post-recursive statements add further complexity to the issue of unrolling as the pipeline may take a non-linear shape and contain heterogeneous stages.         Unrolling the recursive function on the FPGA increases the parallelism available, however the depth of the pipline and therefore the amount of parallelism available, is limited by the finite resources on the FPGA. To make efficient use of the resources on the FPGA the system must be able to unroll the function in a way to best suit the input but also must ensure that the function is not unrolled past its maximum recursive depth. A trivial solution such as unrolling on-demand introduces a latency into the system when a further instance of the function is unrolled that reduces overall performance. To reduce this penalty it is desirable for the system to be able to predict the behaviour of the recursive function based on the input data and unroll the function to a suitable length prior to it being required. Accurate prediction is possible in cases where the condition for recursion is a simple function on the arguments, however in cases where the condition for recursion is based on complex functions, such as the entire recursive function, accurate prediction is not possible. In situations such as this a heuristic is used which provides a close approximation to the correct depth of recursion at any given time. This prediction allows the system to reduce the performance penalty from real time unrolling without over utilization of the the FPGA resources.         Results obtained demonstrate the increase in performance for various recursive functions obtained from the increased parallelism, when compared to a stack based implementation on the same device. In certain instances due to constraints on hardware availability results were gained from device simulation using a simulator developed for this purpose. Details of this simulator are presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reconfigurable hardware</field><field name="subject">fpga</field><field name="subject">recursion</field><field name="subject">compilers</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23366</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic analysis of consumer buyer behaviour in urban China</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Simon, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has experienced rapid economic growth and is now arguably the world???s largest consumer market. However, despite the size and potential of the Chinese market, there is a serious lack of formal understanding of Chinese buyer behaviour. The broad aim of this research is to understand patterns of buyer behaviour through a systematic analysis of the purchasing of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) by urban Chinese consumers. Several specific research questions are addressed: ??? What patterns of brand purchasing and brand loyalty do urban Chinese consumers exhibit? ??? Do these patterns generalise across content, spatial and temporal dimensions? ??? Are there any systematic significant bases of segmentation within the FMCG markets that are studied? ??? What key implications are to be drawn by academics and practitioners? ??? More generally, what is the value of adopting a systematic approach to research in this area of enquiry? ??? Also, what is the value of applying and extending models developed in the West to the Chinese consumer context? The research is divided into two main studies. The first involves secondary consumer panel data and focuses on brand purchasing and loyalty behaviour. Analysis is conducted using the Dirichlet model, which provides theoretical predictions for a range of brand performance measures. The second study involves primary consumer panel data and  examines potential bases of segmentation. Analysis is based on the Generalised Dirichlet Model, which enables the impact of covariates on buyer behaviour to be assessed. It is found that the patterns of Chinese buyer behaviour for FMCGs are generally similar to those in the West. Results unique to the Chinese market are also identified. Importantly, the results and patterns generalise across all dimensions of analysis (that is, for brands within product categories, store types and store chains, and in different regions and cities, and in different time periods). Also, there is a lack of consumer segmentation among directly competing brands within the product categories that are studied. The findings not only make a strong empirical contribution but also have important academic and managerial implications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer behavior.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24175</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of the effects of low dose and high dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment of mild to moderate asthma in adults.</field><field name="creator">Baraket, Melissa</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">corticosteroid</field><field name="subject">dose response</field><field name="subject">cytokine</field><field name="subject">basement membrane</field><field name="subject">spirometry</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">airway hyperresponsiveness</field><field name="subject">mannitol</field><field name="subject">nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">GM-CSF</field><field name="subject">TNF-alpha</field><field name="subject">IL-1ra</field><field name="subject">IL-10</field><field name="subject">FOT</field><field name="subject">forced oscillation technique</field><field name="subject">bronchoalveolar lavage</field><field name="subject">alveolar macrophage</field><field name="subject">bronchial biopsy</field><field name="subject">respiratory system conductance</field><field name="subject">bronchial challenge</field><field name="subject">response dose ratio</field><field name="subject">provocative dose</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4855</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Umman-manda and its Significance in the First Millennium BC</field><field name="creator">Adali, Selim Ferruh</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ancient History</field><field name="subject">Ancient Near Eastern History</field><field name="subject">Mesopotamian Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4890</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A numerical and experimental investigation of autoignition</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Robert Lindsay</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoignition</field><field name="subject">PDF-RANS</field><field name="subject">OH</field><field name="subject">CH2O</field><field name="subject">LIF</field><field name="subject">Rayleigh</field><field name="subject">Laser diagnostics</field><field name="subject">combustion</field><field name="subject">methane</field><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">transport budget</field><field name="subject">detailed chemistry</field><field name="subject">ISAT</field><field name="subject">ignition</field><field name="subject">precursor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4944</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Mobile Phone Radiation on the Human Central Nervous System</field><field name="creator">Perentos, Nicholas</field><field name="description">The effects of mobile phone-like electromagnetic radiation on the human brain activity are examined. The research focuses on both radio frequency (RF) exposures and the much less studied low frequency (ELF) exposures (less than 40 kHz) arising from the battery operation of GSM handsets.    The first single blind study recruited a small sample of twelve human volunteers. The eyes closed resting EEG activity is monitored after radio frequency exposure. With SAR levels of 2 W/kg, results reveal no statistical changes in any of the examined frequency bands for neither pulsed modulated RF signals nor continuous wave RF signals.    In the second double blind study, a sample of 72 volunteers is recruited and an improved protocol comprised of separate pulsed RF, continuous RF and pulsed ELF exposures is employed. Exposures are delivered through a custom made handset capable of independent RF and ELF exposures. Findings include a reduced alpha band frequency activity during pulsed radio frequency and low frequency radiations exposures but no changes under the continuous RF radiation. Changes are present both during as well as after exposure, while greater changes are observed during exposures. The study of some non linear measures of the resting EEG revealed no changes under any of the active exposures.   As the observed changes are very close to the normal EEG variation during resting conditions, their biological significance and health impact is not immediately obvious.

Resorts are a more recent phenomenon in offering similar services. The similarity stops there as the people who use resorts have different expectations and motives to be there. While hotels are mainly used by the business people and are busier during the weekdays, resorts are generally used for vacation and rest and are busy during holiday season. The difference in the clientele's motivations makes it difficult for the resort marketers to effectively position and market the property to the right segment. There have been many studies done primarily on hotel clients, while resorts have largely been neglected.       This study is the first step in evaluating the level of contribution beliefs and past experiences make when Australian tourists decide on their resort accommodation purchase. To achieve this aim the Australian resort market was segmented and then every segment was tested on the model developed for the study.      In this study, 412 people responded by filling out the questionnaires that were put in their rooms, by the participating resorts they were staying in. The study targeted all states and Territories of Australia. Every possible precaution was taken to maintain the anonymity of the respondents and the participating resorts to avoid compromising their financial interests.      The study found four segments of resort tourists. They were named active conventionalists, young conservatives, elite regulars and veterans. The role of beliefs and past experience in purchase decision was found to be of varying degrees amongst the segments. It was also found that benefit beliefs had the bigger role in resort accommodation selection compared to normative beliefs. Control beliefs had the least role in the formation of the purchase behaviour. It was also found that while the Theory of Planned Behaviour was incapable of predicting resort accommodation purchase behaviour on its own, the addition of past behaviour to the mix increased the predictability perceptibly.      The main limitation of the research was that the researcher and the respondents were far removed from each other. It is recommended that in future studies; there must be a provision for qualitative data to complement the quantitative approach. Besides this, there are many more important recommendations made relating to design and application of the questionnaire for future studies. The study also stresses that similar studies should be conducted, preferably on longitudinal basis to confirm or reject the findings of the present study.      The present study contributed to the body of knowledge by providing a theoretical framework and suggesting a resort accommodation purchase predictability model incorporating beliefs and past experience of resort tourists. It also provided resort marketing planners with practical recommendations and implications in terms of attracting the right clients to their resorts as well as how to position their resorts for the intended market segment to get the best returns on their investment in marketing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resorts</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Tourists</field><field name="subject">TPB</field><field name="subject">Past Experience</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090507.121635</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless IP Network Mobility Management: Advancing from Mobile IP to HIP-Based Network</field><field name="creator">So, Yick Hon Joseph</field><field name="description">Wireless networking introduces a whole range of challenges to the traditional TCP/IP network. In particular, IP address the issue of overloading because IP addresses are used as a network locator and an end point identity in the different layers in an OSI model. Even though Mobile IP is widely deployed, it has significant problems relating to performance and security. The Host Identity Protocol (HIP) provides secure mobility management by solving the IP address overloading from another angle. It restructures the TCP/IP model and introduces a new layer and a new namespace. The performance of HIP has proven to be better than Mobile IP and also opens a range of new research opportunities.   This dissertation proposes and analyses a new step-stone solution from the Mobile IP-based network into a HIP-based network. The main advantage of this new solution is that much less change is required to the operating system kernel of the end point compared to a full HIP implementation.  The new step-stone solution allows Mobile IP to use some HIP features to provide better security and handover performance. This dissertation also proposes several new and novel HIP-based wireless communication network architectures. An HIP-based heterogeneous wireless network architecture and handover scheme has been proposed and analysed. These schemes limit the HIP signalling in the wireless network if no communication to external networks is needed. Beside the network architecture modification, the hybrid Session Initial Protocol (SIP) and HIP-based Voice over IP (VoIP) scheme is proposed and analysed. This novel scheme improves the handover latency and security.   This dissertation also proposes and analyses a new and novel extension to HIP, a HIP-based micro-mobility management, micro-HIP (mHIP). mHIP provides a new secure framework for micro-mobility management. It is a more complete HIP-based micro-mobility solution than any other proposed in existing studies. mHIP improves the intra-domain handover performance, the security, and the distribution of load in the intra-domain handover signalling.   The new work presented opens up a number of very interesting research opportunities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Host Identity Protocol (HIP)</field><field name="subject">Micro-HIP (mHIP)</field><field name="subject">Micro-mobility Management</field><field name="subject">Hybrid SIP-HIP (SHIP)</field><field name="subject">Handover</field><field name="subject">Intra-Domain Handover</field><field name="subject">Mobile IP</field><field name="subject">Mobility Management</field><field name="subject">Public Key based Network</field><field name="subject">Session Initial Protocol (SIP)</field><field name="subject">3G</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090507.123036</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deposition, Characterisation, and Piezoelectric Response Estimation of Strontium-doped Lead Zirconate Titanate Thin Films</field><field name="creator">Sriram, Sharath</field><field name="description">Lead zirconate titanate (PZT), in the form of both bulk and thin films, is used in most piezoelectric applications due to its high piezoelectric response coefficients. Strontium-doped lead zirconate titanate (PSZT) has shown improved piezoelectric response characteristics in bulk form. This work investigates the deposition and characterisation of PSZT in the form of thin films, and reports on results from the estimation of the piezoelectric response of these thin films using two new techniques.      The influence of RF magnetron sputter deposition parameters on the composition and orientation of PSZT thin films has been studied. Investigation of the consequence of varying the oxygen partial pressure during deposition on thin film stoichiometry, the influence of the choice of metal-coated silicon substrates on thin film orientation, and the effect of post-deposition cooling rate have been used to identify optimal deposition conditions. The existence of a modified unit cell resulting from these deposition parameters has been verified, and the resulting lattice parameters were estimated. Extensive materials characterisation (using microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy) of the PSZT thin films deposited on gold and platinum coated silicon substrates is reported.      The limited techniques available for quantitative estimation of d33 for piezoelectric thin films initiated an investigation into alternative possibilities, as a consequence of which two new techniques for piezoelectric coefficient estimation, under the inverse piezoelectric effect, have been developed. One technique capitalises on the measurement accuracy of the nanoindenter in following thin film displacement, while the other uses a standard atomic force microscope in contact imaging mode to estimate d33. The development, scope, and limitations of both techniques are discussed.      The techniques developed have been used to estimate the piezoelectric response of PSZT thin films. Depending on the thin film deposition parameters and the analysis frequency, values of piezoelectric response higher than any measured for thin films on silicon have been estimated. PSZT thin films deposited on gold-coated silicon at low deposition temperatures resulted in d33 values up to 892 pm/V. The study of the piezoelectric response in the millihertz frequency regime resulted in colossal values (ranging in tens of thousands of pm/V) for PSZT thin films deposited at high temperatures on platinum-coated silicon. This was hypothesised to be a result of enhanced ferroelastic domain switching. This hypothesis was verified by reducing the clamping on domains by synthesising island-structured PSZT films and obtaining an increased piezoelectric response.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">piezoelectric thin films</field><field name="subject">piezoelectric response</field><field name="subject">RF sputtering</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090507.144751</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reviving History of Ganai Families and Resounding Gunai Language through the Creative Arts for Future Generations</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Colin</field><field name="description">This practice based project presents the story of my research journey, as Ganai man.

The research data consisted of reflectance measurements of various temperate pasture types recorded at four different times (years 2000 to 2002), recorded by three hyperspectral sensors, the in situ ASD, the airborne HyMap and the satellite-borne Hyperion. Corresponding ground-based pasture samples were analysed for content of chlorophyll, water, crude protein, digestibility, lignin and cellulose at three study sites in rural Victoria, Australia. This context was used to evaluate effects of sensor differences, data processing and enhancement, analytical methods and sample variability on the predictive capacity of derived prediction models.    Although hyperspectral data analysis is being applied in many areas very few studies on temperate pastures have been conducted and hardly any encompass the variability and heterogeneity of these southern Australian examples.   The research into the relationship between the spectrometer data and pasture quality attribute assays was designed using knowledge gained from assessment of other hyperspectral remote sensing and near-infrared spectroscopy research, including bio-chemical and physical properties of pastures, as well as practical issues of the grazing industries and carbon cycling/modelling.    Processing and enhancement of the spectral data followed methods used by other hyperspectral researchers with modifications deemed essential to produce better relationships with pasture assay data.   As many different methods are in use for the analysis of hyperspectral data several alternative approaches were investigated and evaluated to determine reliability, robustness and suitability for retrieval of temperate pasture quality attributes. The analyses employed included stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR).    The research showed that the spectral research data had a higher potential to be used for prediction of crude protein and digestibility than for the plant fibres lignin and cellulose. Spectral transformation such as continuum removal and derivatives enhanced the results. By using a modified approach based on sample subsets identified by a matrix of subjective bio-physical and ancillary data parameters, the performance of the models were enhanced.    Prediction models from PLSR developed on ASD in situ spectral data, HyMap airborne imagery and Hyperion and corresponding pasture assays showed potential for predicting the two important pasture quality attributes crude protein and digestibility in hyperspectral imagery at a few quantised levels corresponding to levels currently used in commercial feed testing.    It was concluded that imaging spectrometry has potential to offer synoptic, simultaneous and spatially continuous information valuable to feed based enterprises in temperate Victoria. The thesis provide a significant contribution to the field of hyperspectral remote sensing and good guidance for future hyperspectral researchers embarking on similar tasks. As the research is based on temperate pastures in Victoria, Australia, which are dominated by northern hemisphere species, the findings should be applicable to analysis of temperate pastures elsewhere, for example in Western Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, North America, Europe and northern Asia (China).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temperate pastures</field><field name="subject">pasture quality</field><field name="subject">remote sensing</field><field name="subject">hyperspectral</field><field name="subject">partial least squares regression</field><field name="subject">crude protein</field><field name="subject">digestibility</field><field name="subject">ASD</field><field name="subject">HyMap</field><field name="subject">Hyperion</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090507.163006</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Riccarton Bush and the natural and social realities of native trees in Christchurch, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Doody, Brendan J.</field><field name="description">Urbanization has destroyed and fragmented previously large areas of natural habitat. Small remnants that still exist in numerous cities will be unable to sustain many viable wild plant populations if they do not expand into the surrounding urban matrix. Residential gardens surrounding such remnants, and which form a significant component of urban green space in many cities, could play a role in redressing this problem. Riccarton Bush, a 7.8 hectare forest remnant, and its surrounding suburban residential area, in Christchurch, New Zealand, is a good example. Over 125 years the reported number of native vascular plants in the bush has declined by a third. My study was an attempt to understand: 1) the ecological, social and cultural factors influencing the dispersal and regeneration of 12 native bird-dispersed woody species from Riccarton Bush, into surrounding residential properties; and 2) the potential role residential properties could play in the future of the bush. To examine these diverse factors I adopted an interdisciplinary research approach combining methodologies, concepts and theories from ecology and the social sciences. In a broader context my work was an attempt to demonstrate how urban ecology can further develop and strengthen by adopting and integrating new methodologies, theories and concepts. The ecological component involved recording individuals of the study species found on 90 randomly selected properties within a 1.4 km radius of the bush. Soil samples were also collected from 31 of those properties and placed in a glasshouse and the study species that germinated were recorded. Results showed some species, particularly kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides), the most abundant species in the bush, are being dispersed and establishing on properties predominantly within 250 m of the forest margin. These juveniles are not reaching maturity as most gardeners tend to remove all non-planted woody species. Qualitative interviews with 16 residents and a quantitative survey of the residents of 85 of the properties provided insights into the social context which these natural processes were operating. Using notions of place and performance I argue that gardens are continuously created and recreated by humans and non-humans. Residents attempt to create and maintain a garden that fulfils their individual and familial needs and desires (e.g., aesthetics, leisure and privacy), and public responsibilities such as ensuring they have a &#8216;neat&#8217; and &#8216;tidy&#8217; garden. This involves selecting plants for colour, shape and the care they require, and encouraging certain performances (e.g., flowering) while controlling other undesirable plants and performances (e.g. growth, spread and shading). While people make connections between native plants, belonging and identity; the &#8216;scientific&#8217; demarcation between native and exotic species often becomes obscured as the garden is co-created by people and plants. Some plants become more significant than others but usually this is attributable to their performances rather than whether they are native or exotic. Residential gardens have the potential to play a major role in the conservation of species restricted to urban remnants. My research suggests that although the potential exists for woody species restricted to Riccarton Bush to naturally regenerate in nearby gardens, this will not happen without human intervention. Plants will need to be eco-sourced and propagated to avoid detrimental impacts on the genetic health of remnant populations, and then actively planted in gardens. The success of such planting initiatives will be increased by providing residents with information about the plants that are suitable for their performative needs and desires (e.g., the size, colour, and maintenance requirements of plants) and, most importantly, control over the location of plantings. In concluding, I argue that by adopting new concepts, theories and methodologies, the productivity, creativity and relevance of urban ecology can be significantly enhanced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bird dispersal</field><field name="subject">gardening</field><field name="subject">interdisciplinary research</field><field name="subject">fragmentation</field><field name="subject">native woody species</field><field name="subject">non-human agency</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">plant conservation</field><field name="subject">residential gardens</field><field name="subject">urban ecology</field><field name="subject">urban forest remnant</field><field name="subject">weeds</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/865</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary fibres and their properties : the possibility of fibre lowering the glycaemic index of foods post extrusion : presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of MPhil in Food Science and Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Margaret Anne</field><field name="description">A series of experiments were devised in order to establish the relationship between fibre addition to an extruded breakfast cereal base recipe and the physical, chemical and nutritional qualities of the breakfast cereals. A twin screw extruder was used for all experiments. Preliminary investigations using, guar gum and inulin additions, illustrated that screw configuration was important in determining the physical properties (degree of expansion, firmness and crunchiness) of the extruded products. Thus a screw configuration featuring a reverse screw and mixing zone within the barrel was selected for the larger research study. In the extended experimental design guar gum, inulin, wheat bran, swede fibre, and hi-maize were added to a base recipe at; 5, 10 and 15 % of total dry ingredient content. A further experiment was completed to investigate the synergistic effects of adding differing fibres in combination. Results illustrated that soluble dietary fibres (for instance guar and inulin) created a porous, less firm, but crispier breakfast cereals than the insoluble fibres, which generally produced denser, harder products. The inclusion of fibre into the extruded breakfast cereals did not affect the chemical composition of the breakfast cereal significantly (P=0.05) when taking into account the diluting factor of adding the fibre into the base recipe. However moisture loss / retention on extrusion varied significantly (P=0.05) between fibre combinations. Thus the moisture loss of samples containing guar or inulin were greater than those samples containing wheat bran and swede fibre. The process of extrusion did not significantly effect the amount of protein, starch or fibre in the samples when the extruded samples were compared to the control samples. Pasting properties of samples were evaluated using the Rapid Visco Analyser. This was conducted to try to determine associations between starch pasting properties (gelatinisation events) of the raw and extruded samples and the physical or nutritional quality of the products. However, the results did not show clear associations. An in vitro analysis was conducted to determine the effect of fibre addition on starch breakdown and subsequent release of reducing sugars. Breakfast cereals which included wheat bran, guar and swede fibre all showed a reduced rate of starch degradation compared to the control (P=0.05). These fibres appeared to inhibit the rate of enzyme degradation of starch, in effect increasing the amount of slowly digestible starch in the breakfast cereals. Cereal samples containing inulin did not show this pattern. Generally the rate of inhibition was related to the amount of fibre added to the base recipe. When used in combinations, samples containing inulin and hi-maize were not significantly different to the control in terms of reducing sugar release, whereas inclusion of guar gum significantly reduced this release. In conclusion, the addition of selected fibres can be used effectively as a method of manipulating the starch degradation rates of extruded breakfast cereals. This has nutritional implications in terms of glycaemic index and loading of breakfast cereals. Further work is required to develop clearer associations between the events of starch gelatinisation during extrusion and the potential glycaemic response.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breakfast cereal</field><field name="subject">starch</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/829</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An in vitro antimicrobial and safety study of Lactobacillus reuteri DPC16 for validation of probiotic concept : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Biotechnology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bian, Lei</field><field name="description">Based on previous studies of the novel Lactobacillus reuteri DPC16 strain, an in vitro investigation on the supernatant antimicrobial activity and the culture safety against normal gastrointestinal microflora and gastric mucus was done in this thesis. DPC16 cell-free supernatants (fresh and freeze-dried, designated as MRSc and FZMRSc) from anaerobic incubations in pre-reduced MRS broth, have shown significant inhibitory effects against selected pathogens, including Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. These effects were mainly due to the acid production during incubation as evidenced by the negation of such activity from their pH-neutral counterparts, and this acidic effect was shown to reduce the pathogen growth rate and decrease the total number of pathogen cells. By incubation of concentrated (11 g/L) resting cells in glycerol-supplemented MRS broth, another DPC16 cell-free supernatant (designated as MRSg) has shown very strong antimicrobial effect against all target pathogens. As indicated by a kinetic profile, this activity developed in a sigmoidal fashion as incubation proceeded, reaching to maximum activity after 6-8h and maintained at the same level thereafter. Further study has shown that the antimicrobial activity of this supernatant was pH-independent, effective across a pH range of 4.6 to 6.5, and acted on both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Using the minimum effective dose, a time course investigation has provided evidence that this supernatant affected the growth of the target pathogens by elongating the lag phase and lowering the total cell number at the end of the incubation. Lastly, it was found that the strong antimicrobial effect of MRSg was bactericidal at high concentrations and bacteriostatic at low concentrations. However, it also found that the viability of DPC16 cells also decreased as incubation prolonged, which suggests that this glycerol-derived supernatant had a lethal effect to its own cells. Nevertheless, this lethal effect was exerted to a much lesser extent compared with that to the pathogens. The last DPC16 cell-free supernatant was designated as SGF, which was produced from secondary fermentation of the same resting cells in glycerol-water. SGF did not show a significant antimicrobial activity, which suggests that this specific strain is not capable of utilising glycerol in the absence of fermentable carbohydrates. The antimicrobial activity found in MRSg matched with previously published characteristics of reuterin, which is a unique antimicrobial substance synthesised by L. reuteri when incubated with glycerol. Therefore, a study on the production kinetics of reuterin by DPC16 was carried out. Supernatants of both MRSg and SGF were studied. Results showed that glycerol utilisation occurred in both MRSg and SGF, whereas the bioconversion of glycerol into reuterin was different. In MRSg, glycerol was constantly utilised by DPC16 resting cells, and by the end of an 18h incubation 85.8 mM of glycerol was utilised, where 72.8% was transformed into reuterin. The formation of reuterin initiated with an inclining production and reached the maximum rate of 10.9 mM/h after 6h of incubation, with the total production of 64 mM of reuterin at the end of the 18h incubation. This reuterin production in MRSg followed a similar pattern to that of its antimicrobial activity, which suggests a certain correlation between reuterin formation and the increase of antimicrobial activity in MRSg. Therefore, the major antimicrobial component in MRSg that accounted for its potent antimicrobial activity was very much likely to be reuterin. In SGF, however, detectable reuterin was negligible even though some glycerol may have been absorbed into the highly concentrated DPC16 resting cells. This has responded to the antimicrobial activity assay in that due to the lack of essential carbohydrate nutrient for normal cell metabolism, there was no glycerol utilisation and hence no reuterin synthesis. Having studied the antimicrobial activity of L. reuteri DPC16 and the production of antimicrobial-competent reuterin, two safety issues (the impact on growth on other normal commensal probiotics and mucin degradation activity) of this strain were assessed to further evaluate its probiotic potential. By using similar in vitro assays as in the antimicrobial test, the same set of DPC16 supernatants have demonstrated no adverse effect on the growth of either Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, or Bifidobacterium lactis DR10. No stimulatory effect was found either. By incorporating purified porcine gastric mucin into classic mucin-degradation assays in both liquid and agar media, DPC16 has not exhibited the same mucinolytic activity as that of the faecal flora cultures. Thus, it can be concluded that L. reuteri DPC16 is as safe to the host as normal commensal microflora.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pathogens</field><field name="subject">glycerol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270800 Biotechnology::270899 Biotechnology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/830</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential of mobile devices in New Zealand healthcare : a thesis submitted to the faculty of Massey University at Albany in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Engineering in Software</field><field name="creator">Mirza, Asfahaanullah Baig</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the potential for the use of mobile devices in New Zealand healthcare. Adoption of mobile technology can potentially improve information access at point of care, increase efficiency and patient safety, significantly reduce costs, enhance workflow, and promote evidence-based practice to help make effective decisions. Mobile devices of different size and form such as laptops, tablet PCs, PDAs, smart phones, mobile phones, and RFID offer portability, remote access to clinical data, traceability, convergence, and connectivity which traditional computers cannot emulate. The pervasiveness of mobile devices is increasing both globally and within New Zealand. The potential of mobile technology in healthcare has been recognized by many developed countries; there is adequate evidence for improving productivity, efficiency, and patient engagement. The study focuses on the three prominent healthcare sectors in New Zealand: Primary, Secondary, and Community. As mobile technology is still an underdeveloped area within New Zealand&#8217;s healthcare industry, the use of a qualitative research approach involving surveys and interviews helps to determine which m-health applications are most appropriate to adopt here. The sample surveyed consists of health providers, health strategists, and technology vendors. The potential of mobile devices that were identified from the interviews included real-time access to information such as clinical data, drug database, and medical references. the use of SMS reminders and alerts, use of RFID to reduce medical errors, manage patients and assets, and for identification of medical equipment and drug identification. Over 80 percent of the participants considered privacy, confidentiality, and security to be very important challenges in the m-health domain. Many challenges and implications were identified, including technical constraints such as form factor of mobile devices, storage space, limited battery life, durability, and reading distance of RFID devices. Privacy, security, and ethical issues were discussed including the sensitivity of personal data, sending and receiving of clinical data, RFID tracking ability, security, and encryption standards, authentication barriers, and cultural barriers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">remote access</field><field name="subject">RFID</field><field name="subject">SMS</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/831</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emotional labour and occupational identity : passionate rationality in the New Zealand parliamentary workplace : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stuart, Kathy Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis explores parliamentarians&#8217; emotional labour in their workplace, and argues the enactment of passionate rationality is crucial to how parliamentarians accomplish vocational authenticity. The New Zealand parliamentary workplace is characterised by an elaborate set of feeling rules and a complex emotional culture. On entry to parliament, parliamentarians go through a period of identity transformation akin to a moral career. Parliamentarians must manage emotion to achieve their occupational identities according to local feeling rules. Based on analysis of in-depth group and individual interviews with parliamentarians, and focusing on the passage of the Civil Union Bill as an exemplar of parliamentarians&#8217; emotion work, three interpretative repertoires were identified in their accounts of emotion in the workplace. These repertoires, The Game, The Performance and The Crusade are work-place specific meaning-making resources whose flexible deployment enabled parliamentarians to assert claims of occupational identity and vocational authenticity. These repertoires show the emotional labour involved in parliamentarians&#8217; negotiation of shared meanings around &#8216;entering&#8217; the occupational role and asserting the authenticity of their new identities. In particular, The Crusade repertoire makes available the subject position of the Knight, the subject position important for accomplishment of being a passionately rational worker. In this thesis, I introduce two new concepts for emotional labour in complex workplaces where that labour has both exchange and use value; emotional convocation and personified emotion. Together these concepts allow for a more thorough theorisation of emotion work than do existing concepts of emotional labour. Although developed in relation to the work of parliamentarians, personified emotion and emotional convocation have utility for understanding other contemporary experiences of work where emotion management within a complex emotional culture is fundamental to both occupational identity and the accomplishment of vocational authenticity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vocational authenticity</field><field name="subject">identity transformation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370199 Sociology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/833</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss minimization in the modified algorithm of load flow analysis in industrial power system</field><field name="creator">Lukman, Dedek, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research looks at an alternative technique of loss minimization using B-loss formula in solving load flow analysis. A modeling of electrical system elements is first developed. A literature review on the history and development of load flow analysis and loss minimization especially on the use of B-loss formula are delivered. A report on load flow in practice and loss minimization measures based on a utility visit to EnergyAustralia is given. An analysis on three types of industrial power systems is also discussed. A substantial study on EDSA was made to adapt the commercial load flow program and demonstrate voltage control methods to achieve loss minimization. The research thesis work focuses on the use of a load flow analysis program to calculate and minimize losses in large electrical power distribution system such as an industrial power system. A Matlab load flow analysis program has been developed successfully using modified polar Newton-Raphson algorithms based on bus admittance matrix Ybus and the use of B-loss coefficient method. Real power losses are calculated using Blosses coefficients for achieving loss minimization and the technique has been verified with the traditional I2R and/or differential power methods. Modified load flow algorithm is also implemented by applying voltage control methods using either a shunt capacitor or a load tap changing (LTC) transformer. Voltage level is improved whilst minimizing losses. Appropriate modeling of a capacitor and an LTC transformer have been developed proven. A network of a typical meshed secondary selective system of five bus has been chosen and used as the test case. Several case studies with different values of capacitance and tap settings of transformer have been conducted to determine minimum losses. Further sensitivity analysis is carried out by simulating a wide range of load power configurations and line and transformer resistances to verify the robustness of the proposed modified algorithms especially on the use of B-losses algorithm for the chosen network. Results showed that the proposed algorithms ,although less accurate than full I2R calculations, are robust and reliable to achieve loss minimization for various ranges of load and impedance configurations. There is confidence in applying the method to larger systems. This two-year thesis details novel contribution towards loss minimization in power systems by applying B-losses formula into a load flow program, expressing the system losses in terms of active power generations which allows coordination of transmission losses in scheduling output of each generating plant. This gives maximum economy for a given load and achieves loss minimization using voltage control methods. This technique is not possible using standard commercial load flow programs.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35453</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The applications of multi-component nucleic acid enzymes (MNAzymes)</field><field name="creator">Suwandi, Ronald, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The emergence of MNAzymes (Multi-component nucleic acid enzymes) provides a new approach for detection of target analytes in various applications. In this thesis, three novel MNAzyme-based methodologies were developed to expand the range of the applications of MNAzymes. MNAzymes can be coupled with DNA or RNA ligands called aptamers to generate an apta-MNAzyme system, which can be used for the detection of non-nucleic target analytes such as small molecules and proteins. Direct detection using apta-MNAzyme system is performed in a format, which was isothermal, fluorescent, rapid, and requires no protein enzymes. Apta-MNAzymes can be coupled with a signal amplification cascade to increase the sensitivity of the reaction.  Another MNAzyme-based methodology termed truncated MNAzyme arm system was developed to discriminate the presence of a single base mismatch of two closely related sequences. The system employs a partzyme with a truncated sensor arm and a stabiliser oligonucleotide that binds adjacently to the truncated sensor arm to stabilise the active MNAzyme structure. Truncated MNAzyme real-time PCR system is capable of discriminating the presence of a single base mismatch in a target DNA with high specificity and sensitivity (down to approximately 10 gene copies).  The generic nature of the system enables simultaneous detection of three SNP targets in a multiplex format. MNAzymes was also investigated with various strategies to discriminate DNA sequences that are either methylated or unmethylated. In this thesis, bisulphite-treated DNA samples present in as low as 0.032 % of methylated DNA in a background of unmethylated DNA were discriminated using MNAzyme real-time methylation specific PCR (MSP) system. Furthermore, the presence of 5-methylcytosines in a target sequence increases the melting temperature of the duplex DNA. This was exploited further to directly discriminate DNA methylation status of target sequences using the truncated MNAzyme arm system without the need for bisulphite modification.

The Capitol represented the essential idea from which he constructed an organic design, integrated with the site conditions and following Sullivan's famous dictum Form follows function. It signified organic democracy, 'a grass roots view' which Griffin shared with Sullivan, rather than the 'top down view' of the mandated power of Government. In order to provide an understanding of how these principles informed Griffin's design, Sullivan's and Griffin's published and unpublished writings are critically reviewed for evidence of the convergence of ideas and agreement on fundamental principles. Resonance with these principles was found in the Competition Drawings and the Original Report entered in the Competition by Griffin. The analysis also drew upon an extensive critical review of sources such as Marion Mahony Griffin's Magic of America, parliamentary papers, archival records, personal papers, and the published literature of Australian and American scholars on Sullivan and Griffin. Sources pertaining to historical movements in architecture and town planning and narratives on architecture for government also formed part of this critical review. The conclusion is that when the desires of the Commonwealth Government were focused by its chief architect on Griffin's Capitol site as the place which should be occupied by Parliament House, the nadir was reached for Griffin's original concept. The vision supplanted, the unravelling of Griffin's organic city plan, with its connections with the ideas of Louis Sullivan, began. Other ideologies began to be introduced with other relationships of form and function, and cost to the organism which was Griffin's city .</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Griffin's Capitol</field><field name="subject">Sullivan connection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43380</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern as process: an aesthetic exploration of the digital possibilities for conventional, physical lace patterns</field><field name="creator">Kenning, Gail Joy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pattern is a familiar concept ever present in our daily lives, existing in many material forms, observable in varied states, and able to be created from a diverse range of processes and events. Natural pattern forms, such as biological and chemical patterns, have been extensively studied, often within the digital environment because of its capacity to process large amounts of data which aids investigation of not only their characteristics but their potentiality. However, human designed physical patterns, while having been investigated extensively in terms of their historical, geographic and cultural significance and their aesthetic and/or mathematical characteristics, have not been fully investigated in terms of their evolutionary potential.  This project explores one example of human designed physical patterns, crochet lace patterns ??? which have remained largely stable and consistent throughout various technological transformations such as the industrial revolution ??? in order to explore pattern as a process and investigate the potential for these patterns to become emergent. This exploration translated the patterns into the digital environment where, as data, the patterns become available for manipulation using a generative art practice approach. By translating the patterns into a digital environment and engaging with the pattern forms at their systematic core, where crochet pattern instructions and software programming scripts operate similarly as ???code???, this research provided a deeper understanding of the patterns and allowed exploration of whether a pattern???s developmental path can be altered to create new emergent patterns. This research draws on systems theory and systems aesthetics and their application within contemporary generative art practice and informs visual arts in several areas including showing how aesthetic values shift as work becomes cross-disciplinary and enters the digital environment, and how the introduction and location of innovation affects the relationship between the original and its copy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital media.</field><field name="subject">Art.</field><field name="subject">Craft.</field><field name="subject">New media.</field><field name="subject">Aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Lace and lace making.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39898</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development, pilot and validation of a multicultural cognitive assessment scale</field><field name="creator">Storey, Joella E, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia is a multicultural society with an ageing population.  Diseases such as dementia, which affect older age groups, are therefore becoming increasingly important health issues.  Brief cognitive assessment instruments are used to screen older patients for dementia.  Many of these instruments have been developed for use in English speaking populations and are not culture-fair or easily translated for use with non-English speakers.  To ensure that people from all cultural backgrounds receive optimal health care, primary health care workers need a quick, reliable, and non-threatening dementia screening tool that is valid across cultures and easy to administer in a wide range of settings.  This thesis explores the philosophical, scientific, and social antecedents of current approaches to measuring cognition.  It argues that these have led to the treatment of culture as an intrinsic human attribute rather than one which describes variations in human experience.  The consequences for approaches to the assessment of cognition in people from diverse cultural backgrounds are discussed and a model is presented to provide theoretical support for the development of a multicultural cognitive screening test for dementia.  Following a literature review of brief cognitive screening instruments, clock drawing tests, and cross-cultural cognitive tests, two studies are presented.  The first study tests the hypothesis that clock drawing is a useful multicultural screening instrument.  There were no significant differences between six clock scoring methods for predicting dementia in a sample of 93 patients from non-English speaking backgrounds.  While the Wolf-Klein clock scoring method produced the best trade-off between sensitivity (78%) and specificity (58%), this was insufficient to recommend clock drawing as a useful screening test for dementia in a multicultural population. The second study provides support for the hypothesis that a cognitive screening test with good predictive accuracy can be developed and used to screen for dementia in a multicultural population.  This study reports the development, pilot, and validation stages of a multicultural cognitive test with excellent diagnostic accuracy (Area under the ROC curve = 0.95) and 89% sensitivity and 98% specificity for detecting dementia.  This research has important implications for current clinical practice and the potential to improve public health for many Australians.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22821</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement learning and approximation complexity</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Matthew A. F</field><field name="description">Many tasks can easily be posed as the problem of responding to the states of an external world with actions that maximise the reward received over time. Algorithms that reliably solve such problems exist. However, their worst-case complexities are typically more than proportional to the size of the state space in which a task is to be performed. Many simple tasks involve enormous numbers of states, which can make the application of such algorithms impractical. This thesis examines reinforcement learning algorithms which effectively learn to perform tasks by constructing mappings from states to suitable actions. In problems involving large numbers of states, these algorithms usually must construct approximate, rather than exact, solutions and the primary issue examined in the thesis is the way in which the complexity of constructing adequate approximations scales as the size of a state space increases. The vast majority of reinforcement learning algorithms operate by constructing estimates of the long-term value of states and using these estimates to select actions. The potential effects of errors in such estimates are examined and shown to be severe. Empirical results are presented which suggest that minor errors are likely to result in significant losses in many problems, and where such losses are most likely to occur. The complexity of constructing estimates accurate enough to prevent significant losses is also examined empirically and shown to be substantial.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2003.0009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computer Model of the Cellular Slime Mould Dictyostelium Discoideum</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Roger P</field><field name="description">Excitable media are an important class of systems, examples of which include epidemics, predator-prey interactions, nervous systems, and heart muscle. Aggregating cellular slime moulds are an example of an excitable medium. The species of cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum is an important model organism that many science laboratories use. Studying the aggregation of slime moulds increases knowledge about excitable media generally. One method of studying the aggregation of slime mould is to simulate theft behaviour on a computer model. This thesis presents the author's computer model of cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum and the results of experiments carried out using the computer model. The experiments investigate the relation between the aggregation patterns and the various parameters of the model. These parameters are the density of artificial slime moulds, the acrasin threshold, the acrasin degradation rate, and the rate of acrasin secretion. Randomness has an effect on the aggregation patterns produced. Results of experiments are presented that examine the effect of randomness. Two forms of randomness are investigated: random secretion of acrasin by the artificial slime moulds; random initial reactivity of the artificial slime moulds. The computer model describes an artificial environment in which artificial slime mould amoebae interact with each other and their environment. Out of these individual interactions the global patterns that characterize slime mould aggregations emerge. The model facilitates the study of these individual interactions and hence the global patterns that emerge. The model and the experimental results described in this thesis contribute to the study of the aggregation phase of the life cycle of Dictyosteliuni discoideum. The author proposes mechanism that could underlie certain classes of aggregation patterns. These patterns include net-like aggregations and loop aggregations. The computer model presented in this thesis is successful in emulating the behaviour of the cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum. In its present form the model is a useful tool to biologists. The results of experiments conducted with the model suggest mechanisms that may underlie certain pattern produced by living slime moulds. A result of particular interest is the initiation of the spiral wave pattern from a loop wave, which produces a loop aggregation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Slime mould</field><field name="subject">Dictyostelium discoideum</field><field name="subject">loop aggregation</field><field name="subject">excitable media</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20050906.112225</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Intelligent System for the Pre-Mission Analysis of Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Operations</field><field name="creator">Atyeo, Simon Vincent</field><field name="description">The Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) accident rate has driven operators from around the world to address the management of risks inherent to their operations. In-flight decision-making, pre-flight planning, failure to follow standard operating procedures, delayed remedial actions, and misinterpretation of environmental cues are all areas that need to be addressed for safe HEMS operations.      HEMS operations are complex, being a joint exercise between the flight crew, paramedics and supporting agencies. Operations occur around-the-clock, in all-weather conditions, and often with no fore-warning. In a time critical operation, where precious minutes may cost lives, operators must decide which cases warrant a HEMS response and if so, whether the conditions are safe to conduct the mission.       Intelligent systems are an emerging field offering benefits to a multitude of applications. This research forms a comprehensive investigation of the application of 'intelligent systems' to the pre-mission analysis of HEMS operations. The research has resulted in the development of a prototype decision support system capable of assisting in the pre-mission analysis of HEMS operations. The prototype system is capable of supporting flight coordinators and crew in the decision-making processes prior to HEMS operations and can potentially improve emergency medical services to the community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helicopter Emergency Medical Service</field><field name="subject">HEMS</field><field name="subject">Decision Support</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090508.102128</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

It further seeks to identify the relative importance of these motives and to explore relationships between motivation and mobility behaviour. This study on self-initiated mobility is opportune as an increasingly globalised market place and a demand for the skills of the highly educated result in competition for workers. Most literature concerning mobility focuses on expatriate assignment.  By comparison, self-initiated movers remain an under-researched group.  Moreover, of the limited research on self-initiated mobility, most have used interviewing and narrative methods, so that the available information is detailed but restricted to individual experiences.  This study used a self-report survey via the internet to collect both quantitative and qualitative data and yielded 2,608 useable responses from New Zalanders living and working throughout the world.  It was highly exploratory, using the analytical marketing tool CHAID to show linkages between subjective attitudinal motives and objective measures of moility behaviours. The desire for cultural and travel opportunities was the dominant subjective motive, being the best predictor for the objective mobility behaviours of establishment, current spatiality and return propensity and being a secondary predictor for restlessness.  Other associations were evident between the quality of life motive and the behaviour of restlessness, the career motive and cultural globalism and the relationships motive and the behaviour of latent transience.  Economics and the political environment motives were not found to be significant predictors of any behaviour. The subjective data reinforced the importance of the cultural and travel opportunities and career motives, ranking these the most important motives in a decision to be mobile.  Within these motives, opportunities for travel and adventure and for career development were central.  Economics was ranked as the third most important motive, contrary to extant literature, followed by relationships, quality of life and the political environment.  The priority accorded to each of these six motives varies according to gender, location and life stage, creating different equations of motivation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mobility</field><field name="subject">OE</field><field name="subject">New Zealanders</field><field name="subject">working overseas</field><field name="subject">career development</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/834</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History, law and land : the languages of native policy in New Zealand's general assemby, 1858-62 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in History at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Samuel D</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the languages of Native policy in New Zealand&#8217;s General Assembly from 1858 to 1862.

An examination of the international literature suggested that contextual professional development, classroom action research, and a collaborative relationship with a critical friend would facilitate inclusive pedagogy. However, there were no published studies of New Zealand primary teachers engaged in classroom-centred action research on inclusion involving an educational psychologist. A two phase action research design was used, firstly negotiated and modelled by an outside researcher, second order action research, and secondly by empowering the teachers to become action researchers, first order action research. Some inclusive practices were evident but two major barriers to inclusive practice in New Zealand classrooms were highlighted. These were an independent and autonomous teacher practice and limited use of individual student assessment data to inform teaching for individual learning. Active reflective thinking through reflection journals and teacher action research of teacher chosen classroom learning challenges occurred in two cycles of second order action research. Results established increased teacher focus on individual student learning, collaboration between themselves and the researcher, knowledge and skills of action research and its effectiveness in solving learning challenges within the teaching programme, use of student assessment data to inform subsequent teaching and learning, and critical awareness of the effect of their beliefs, knowledge and actions on student learning. Whilst literature suggests that schoolwide re-culturing is necessary, this research has demonstrated that two teachers engaging in practitioner action research, supported by a small community of practice, reflective thinking and critical dialogue, can improve their pedagogical and inclusive practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inclusion</field><field name="subject">teacher learning</field><field name="subject">action research study</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">professional development of teachers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/840</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of acquisition form, domestic liquidity costs for US cross-listed firms, and convergence in information environment : an investor protection perspective : a dissertation submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance, Department of Commerce, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nhut Hoang</field><field name="description">This dissertation contains three empirical studies that examine the effect of investor protection on three different aspects of corporate governance: mergers and acquisitions, US cross-listings, and convergence of information environment around the world.1 The first study investigates the relation between investor protection and the choice of acquisition form (partial versus full acquisition). I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

One possibility involves the development of perennial cereal crops, but the mechanisms of perenniality first need to be understood. While in annual cereals flowering structures die following seed production, in perennial grasses, perenniality is achieved by maintaining at least one shoot in a vegetative state. There are two views on perennating tiller origin in perennial grasses: some authors suggest that all over-wintering tillers flower in spring and summer, leaving spring-initiated tillers to perennate, while others indicate that spring-initiated tillers are too immature to survive summer conditions, thereby implying that flowering must be prevented in some over-wintering tillers. An understanding of perenniality will therefore require an understanding of flowering control in these species. Temperate perennial grasses have dual induction requirements for flowering, where plants become competent to perceive inductive signals following vernalisation, and flowering is initiated by inductive photoperiods. Two hypotheses were formulated to test these models. The &#8216;environmental control hypothesis&#8217; stated that all adequately vernalised perennial ryegrass tillers would flower on sufficient exposure to inductive photoperiods. Alternatively, the &#8216;spatial control hypothesis&#8217; stated that in addition to the environmental mechanisms, a spatial control mechanism acts to regulate flowering. Two experiments were conducted to test these hypotheses. Perennial ryegrass and Italian (annual) ryegrass were induced to flower and differences between the annual and perennial habits at flowering time were observed. However neither hypothesis was proven. In the second experiment, flowering was studied in detail in individual tillers of perennial ryegrass. The eldest tiller flowered in all flowering plants. The second eldest tiller did not flower in 72% of plants with more than one reproductive tiller, while the third eldest tiller flowered in 94% of these plants. These data favour the spatial control hypothesis which suggests that a spatial regulatory mechanism might act to repress flowering in some competent perennial ryegrass tillers. These results were supported by studies of meristem morphology and by a preliminary gene expression study. Maintenance of older, established tillers in a vegetative state might allow the perennial plant a greater chance of survival during summer.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flowering control</field><field name="subject">photoperiodism</field><field name="subject">spatial control</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/842</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating online support for mobile phone selection : using properties and performance criteria to reduce information overload : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Science in Information Systems at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yang, Chun Chieh</field><field name="description">The mobile phone has been regarded as one of the most significant inventions in the field of communications and information technology over the past decade. Due to the rapid growth of mobile phone subscribers, hundreds of phone models have been introduced. Therefore, customers may find it difficult to select the most appropriate mobile phone because of information overload. The aim of this study is to investigate web support for customers who are selecting a mobile phone. Firstly, all the models of mobile phones in the New Zealand market were identified by visiting shops and local websites. Secondly, a list of all the features of these mobile phones was collated from local shops, websites and magazines. This list was categorised into mobile phone properties and performance criteria. An experiment then compared three different selection support methods: A (mobile phone catalogue), B (mobile phone property selection) and C (mobile phone property and performance criteria selection). The results of the experiment revealed that selection support methods B and C had higher overall satisfaction ratings than selection support method A; both methods B and C had similar satisfaction ratings. The results also suggested that males and females select their mobile phones differently, though there was no gender preference in selection support methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cellphones</field><field name="subject">web support</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280109 Decision support and group support systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/844</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Masked projection stereolithography : improvement of the Limaye model for curing single layer medium sized parts : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering (School of Engineering and Advanced Technology) at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zyzalo, Jonathan Richard</field><field name="description">Modern Rapid Prototyping (RP) technology has been available for more than a decade and has aided in shortening product development times and costs in the manufacturing sector. Stereolithography (SL), the most mature of RP technology, has primarily been used to build small to medium sized parts although there are largescale applications i.e. the automotive industry that uses &#8220;mammoth SLA&#8221;. Recent developments in SL have been aimed at increasing the speed of the additive process of most SL apparatus (SLA). Developments include the chemistry of photopolymer resins, integral-curing processes as opposed to vector-by-vector processes, and what is now called microstereolithography. Integral curing has been made possible by the advent of dynamic masking generators such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and digital micromirror devices (DMDs). Much of the theory for this new layering process has been applied to the micro-scale and awaits application for medium to large sized parts. The Limaye Model was applied to a microstereolithography apparatus (&#181;SLA) and used as a process planning method for curing dimensionally accurate micro parts. Examination of the results of this mathematical model shows an irradiance map simulating the irradiances on the resin surface. The light is expected to attenuate from the central axis according to a measured irradiance curve. Improvements can be made to the Limaye Model to make it applicable for the process planning of medium to large parts. It is the aim of this research to present an improved mathematical model of the Limaye Model, so that a given irradiance map will produce an evenly distributed irradiance and account for errors in the optical imaging system. It is hoped that the field of exposure of 200mm x 270mm or larger will be achieved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modern Rapid Prototyping</field><field name="subject">masked projection stereolithography</field><field name="subject">Limaye Model</field><field name="subject">mechatronics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290300 Manufacturing Engineering::290301 Robotics and mechatronics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/849</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of substrate analogues and inhibitors for phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase and indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mulchin, Benjamin Joseph</field><field name="description">The general biosynthetic pathway for tryptophan is known. However, little information has been gathered on how substrates and enzymes interact when phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (PRAI) and indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (IPGS) convert a substituted phenyl ring, PRA, into an indole moiety, IGP, via 1-(O-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5-phosphate (CdRP). There has been no serious synthetic approach to develop methodology to produce a plethora of substrate and product analogues of CdRP. The studies described in this thesis cover methodology focusing on secondary aryl amine formation, using reductive amination, nucleophilic substitution and epoxide ring opening, leading to CdRP analogues. Reductive aminations with D-ribose failed to produce any aryl glycosylamine precursor, possibly due to the low nucleophilicity of aryl amines such as aniline. Removing the aromaticity and using cyclohexylamine produced secondary amines in moderate yield in the presence of benzylpentanal, and NaBH3CN, at a pH of 5.5. This led to a successful reductive amination using anthranilate methyl ester. Secondary aryl amine synthesis via epoxide ring opening proved consistently reproducible. Using LiNTf2 and high equivalents of cyclohexylamine or aniline in neat conditions opened protected epoxides. This has led to the formation of advanced secondary aryl amine synthons and the development of methodology leading to target compounds with functionality at the 1,2 and 5 positions. Nucleophilic substitution using caesium base, high equivalents aniline at room temperature, gave a moderate yield of secondary aryl amines from sulfonyl and bromide good leaving groups. Raising the reaction temperature improved yields using low equivalents of aniline, with the optimal temperature being 50 &#176;C. Ultimately using both the high equivalents of aniline or anthranilate methyl ester and warming the reaction in DMF gave the highest yields of secondary aryl amines. No overalkylated tertiary amine was isolated when a caesium base was used. Boc N-protection of 1-phenylamino-4-pentene and asymmetric dihydroxylation gave the corresponding diol, which was phosphorylated giving the protected target 1,4,5 compound. The methodology leading to the protected target 1,4,5 compound synthesis provides a means to the synthesis additional of CdRP analogues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aryl amine formation</field><field name="subject">epoxides</field><field name="subject">tryptophan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/845</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality inspection of leather using novel planar sensor : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering (Research), School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Kasturi, Vishnu Mohan</field><field name="description">Value of leather produced from sheep is determined by its quality and looseness is one of the quality attributes that determines the value of the leather.

Specifically, these differences have been identified in story content, use of different sources and use of mobilising information. This thesis asks whether such differences can be identified in newspapers&#8217; coverage of the 2001 Local Body Elections in New Zealand. The research involved content analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s six largest daily newspapers, three of them with experience of using public journalism and three with no such experience. Interviews were also conducted with two or three senior journalists involved in organising each paper&#8217;s election campaign in order to explore their goals for the election coverage and evaluation of it. The results mirror those of previous research by showing significant differences in the coverage of the newspapers with public journalism experience in relation to some factors, but not others. The papers with a public journalism background consistently used more non-elite sources than the traditional papers, but did not consistently use more female sources. They also included mobilising information in stories more frequently and made greater use of story features, or &#8220;elements&#8221;, associated with public journalism. However, one of the papers with no experience of public journalism also ranked highly in relation to these two factors. The interviews revealed some differences in goals among the journalists, but this was not a simple split between the journalists on papers with public journalism experience and the other journalists. For example, not all interviewees working for the papers experienced in using public journalism agreed that their goal should be to boost voter turnout. Nor was an overt commitment to supporting the democratic process expressed only by staff on the papers with public journalism experience. The interviews did, however, identify that only the three newspapers with a public journalism background used polling to identify the issues that were important to the public and proceeded to cover these issues during their election campaign</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public journalism</field><field name="subject">communication management</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">newspaper journalism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">2001 Local Body elections</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420304 Screen and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/838</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Which species to save? : a theoretical and empirical analysis on the selection process involved with NGOs and species conservation : [a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Business Studies at Massey University, Albany]</field><field name="creator">Riley, Philip Arthur</field><field name="description">[No abstract supplied]</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">species conservation</field><field name="subject">selection process</field><field name="subject">economics</field><field name="subject">econometric methods</field><field name="subject">non-governmental organisations</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">conservation organisations</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340400 Econometrics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/848</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating summer and autumn endoparasitism in farmed red deer, effects of weaning date, anthelmintic treatment and forage species : a thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mwendwa, James Musyimi</field><field name="description">Previous research has shown that even small numbers of lung and gastro-intestinal (GI) nematodes cause sub-clinical infections during autumn and can reduce voluntary feed intake (VFI) and liveweight gain (LWG) post-weaning in farmed deer. However, little is known about the effect of parasitism on growth of young farmed deer prior to weaning (summer and early autumn). At present, the control of deer parasites is largely by anthelmintic treatment. Alternatively, chicory sown as a pure sward has been shown to reduce parasitism and increase post-weaning growth of deer compared with perennial ryegrass-based pasture, although, neither forage plantain nor the inclusion of chicory in a pasture mix have yet been evaluated in this context. In addition, it has been suggested that to achieve a high pregnancy rate early in the mating season, deer calves should be weaned prior to mating to optimise nutrition and body condition of the hinds. At present there is no adequate evidence in the published literature to justify this. Two experiments were conducted in 2005 and 2006 respectively. The first experiment investigated the impact of early or late pre-rut weaning, with and without anthelmintic treatment, on parasitism and growth (LWG g/day) of deer calves during summer and early autumn. Weaning date effects on hind reproductive parameters were also investigated. The second experiment was a preliminary investigation to compare the effect of grazing permanent perennial ryegrass pasture (Lolium perenne) with chicory (Cichorium intybus) narrow-leaved plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and pasture mixes based on short-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TSR-mix; nil endophyte) or long-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TLR-mix; low endophyte), with both mixes sown with the same clover (white and red) and chicory, on post-weaning growth and endoparasitism of weaned farmed red deer calves in autumn. In 2005, seventy-six deer calves were randomly allocated in a 2x2 factorial design, involving sex, genotype, weaning date (February 17 or March 17), treatment with either topical moxidectin (0.5mg/kg) on January 14 and February 25 or no anthelmintic treatment. Liveweight gain, faecal gastrointestinal egg counts (FEC) and lungworm larval counts (FLC), haematological parameters and serum proteins concentrations (i.e., total protein, albumin and globulin) of calves were measured. Mixed-age adult hinds (64) were used to investigate the effect of weaning date on internal parasitism, conception date and pregnancy rate determined by ultrasound scanning. These hinds were not given anthelmintic treatment, but FLC and FEC were determined on  January 12, February 17, March 17, March 31 and May 4. All deer rotationally grazed permanent perennial ryegrass-based pasture (Lolium perenne) together until weaning at which point calves were removed to separate but similar pasture. Calves weaned in March had a higher LWG to March 31 than those weaned in February (P&lt;0.0001). Faecal larval count in treated calves was zero, but FEC remained similar to the untreated control calves, regardless of when they had been treated (average 136 epg, range 0-600 epg in mid February and average 92, range 0-350 epg at the end of March). Treated calves had higher serum albumin, and lower serum globulin concentrations than the untreated control group (albumin, 36.2 &#177; 0.3 vs 35.2 &#177; 0.3g/L; P&lt;0.001; globulin, 23.9 &#177; 0.4 vs 25.5 &#177; 0.4g/L; P&lt;0.005). In hinds, FLC averaged 5 lpg (range 0 &#8211; 122) and FEC averaged 26 (range 0- 200) with no significant relationship between weaning date and either FLC or FEC. No effect of weaning date on conception rate or date was observed. This study showed that pre-rut weaning date, (although confounded by weaning process management) and sub-clinical parasitism during summer and early autumn may influence LWG in young farmed deer. The failure of moxidectin to reduce FEC to zero raises the question of the efficacy of this macrocyclic lactone anthelmintic against GI nematodes in farmed deer and/or emergence of farmed deer GI nematode resistance. Potential diagnostic parameters such as serum albumin concentration, which was reduced in untreated control deer, warrant further investigation for clinical diagnostic use in farmed deer. The study also highlighted the need for further research to demonstrate the advantages or disadvantages of pre-rut weaning on growth of deer calves and hind reproduction. The 2006 grazing experiment investigated the effect of pasture species grazed on post-weaning growth and endoparasitism of farmed red deer from 3- 6 months of age. Ninety-five red deer calves were randomly allocated to five groups based on sex, LW, FEC and FLC. These calves rotationally grazed either a permanent pasture based on perennial ryegrass, chicory, narrow-leaved plantain, or one of two pasture mixes based on either a short-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TSR-mix) or long-rotation tetraploid ryegrass (TLR-mix). Both mixes included the same white clover, red clover and chicory. All deer were initially treated with an anthelmintic (albendazole), with subsequent trigger treatment withheld until weight loss or clinical parasitism was observed. Anthelmintic trigger treatment (albendazole) was given on an individual animal basis.  The anthelmintic trigger treatment and LWG data in this study suggest that plantain, TLR- and TSR-mixes and chicory may all have a role in aiding control of endoparasitism in young growing deer in autumn in deer production systems based on permanent perennial ryegrass-based pasture with low anthelmintic input. However, any potential effects of forage feeding value and anti-parasitic plant compounds of chicory, plantain and pasture-forage mixes on parasitism and growth could not be separated in this study. It is therefore acknowledged that these observations are preliminary and based on a design intended only to establish whether further replicated studies are warranted, particularly with plantain and pasture mixes. However, the study has shown that pasture species, either sown as a pure crop or in a pasture mix can influence LWG, resilience to internal parasitism and requirement for anthelmintic use in young farmed deer. Data from the first experiment (2005) has shown that pre-rut weaning date and sub-clinical parasitism during summer and early autumn can influence LWG in young farmed deer while the trigger treatment and LWG data from the second experiment (2006), suggest that plantain, TLR-and TSR-mixes and chicory may have a role in aiding control of internal parasitism in young deer in autumn. The outcome of the second experiment has application to deer production systems with low anthelmintic input. Serum protein and haematological parameters investigated in both studies demonstrated the need for further research to establish diagnostic markers for both sub-clinical and clinical internal parasitism in farmed young deer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">farmed red deer</field><field name="subject">endoparasitism</field><field name="subject">control of deer parasites</field><field name="subject">chicory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300405 Animal production (pests and pathogens)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/837</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing postal survey nonresponse bias by sample selection incorporating noncontact propensity : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Healey, Benjamin John</field><field name="description">Noncontact, the failure of a postal survey sample member to receive a survey request, is a potential source of nonresponse bias that has largely been ignored. This is due to the difficulty of separating the components of nonresponse in postal surveys when nothing is heard from potential respondents. Yet, the need to understand postal nonresponse is increasing as more studies move to mixed mode designs incorporating a postal element, and technological, resource and societal changes increase the attractiveness of self-administered surveys. Thus, this research sought to estimate the level of noncontact in postal surveys, to identify the direction and magnitude of bias due to it, and to investigate targeted in-field mechanisms for reducing this bias. A series of empirical studies involving New Zealand postal surveys fielded between 2001 and 2006 were undertaken to meet these aims. Noncontact was found to relate to survey-independent demographic variables (e.g., age, household composition). Furthermore, its incidence was estimated to be as much as 400% higher than indicated by &#8216;gone, no address&#8217; (GNA) returns, although an envelope message tested as part of the research was able to increase levels of GNA reporting significantly. Thus, noncontact was established as a nontrivial source of nonresponse in the surveys examined. As far as bias is concerned, noncontacts had a different profile compared to refusers and ineligibiles, and were estimated to account for up to 40% of net nonresponse error for some of the variables in the surveys examined. Accordingly, there appears to be a clear opportunity for methods targeted at reducing noncontact bias to improve final survey estimates for a range of items. A number of potential methods for reducing noncontact bias were explored, but only one had both a compelling theoretical foundation and potential for wide applicability; the noncontact propensity sampling (NPS) scheme. In a resampling simulation study a prototype of the scheme, which increases the selection probabilities for sample units with a higher predicted propensity for noncontact, consistently improved the demographic profile of valid postal survey returns compared to a simple random sample (SRS). Furthermore, the scheme reduced nonresponse bias by an average of 28% as measured against a range of frame variables (e.g., age, gender) and 17% as measured against survey variables for which census parameters were known (e.g., religiosity, household size, qualifications, income and marital status). Although the prototype NPS procedure increased the standard deviation of simulated point estimates for a given sample size (1,500 in this research), the effect was small; an average of 4% for frame variables and 2% for survey variables. Furthermore, the scheme had almost no impact on reported cooperation rates and is likely to be cost effective compared to other potential targeted in-field mechanisms, particularly in situations where researchers regularly survey a specific population. Pairing the scheme with three common post-survey adjustment methods (frame or census age/sex cell weighing, and response wave extrapolation) did not lead to consistently better estimates than an unweighted SRS. But this was largely due to the shortcomings of these methods because in many cases combining them with either sampling scheme (SRS or NPS) actually degraded estimates. This reinforces the idea that researchers should expend effort minimising bias during the field period rather than relying on post-survey weighting to deal with the issue. Finally, since the NPS scheme aims to reduce error due to noncontact but is not expected to affect error due to other components (e.g., refusal, ineligibility), it presents an opportunity for researchers to begin decomposing the various facets of postal survey nonresponse bias, an important precursor to the development of other targeted bias reduction interventions. Thus, as a methodological tool, the NPS scheme may serve a dual role as both a bias reduction and decomposition mechanism. In addition to their implications for postal survey research, the methods developed and insights into noncontact established in this research are likely to have applications in other domains. In particular, they will inform activities such as research into online survey nonresponse, organisational database management cost reduction and list procurement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postal surveys</field><field name="subject">non-response bias</field><field name="subject">non-contact propensity</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">sample selection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/836</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the regional procurement service depots in the Philippines : a case of region 1 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master in Public Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vicente, Ria S.</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of recent procurement reform done by the Government of the Philippines, particularly the centralized procurement system for common-use supplies, materials, and equipment. The centralized procurement system is adopted with the intent of taking advantage of the savings inherent to bulk purchasing, streamlining procurement procedures, and reducing opportunities for corruption in the procurement of the abovementioned items. By legislative authority under Republic Act No. 9184, the centralized procurement system was made mandatory among all government agencies, government owned and controlled corporations and local government units in the purchase of their supplies, materials and equipment requirements. With the introduction of tighter budget and the stronger pressure for good governance, the contributions of procurement policy and institutions of procurements to the achievement of good governance and potential relation to development has been gaining global recognition. Given the association of procurement to the way public money is spent, the issue on corruption is also central to this research. There has been a growing recognition of the relationship between corruption and development &#8211; the more corrupt a country is, the more underdeveloped it becomes. With the daunting task of battling against corruption, the country&#8217;s strategy is to direct its efforts in combating corruption in specific areas, like public procurement. This thesis demonstrates that the centralized procurement system offers a significant reduction in processing times in the conduct of procurement. Additionally, it offers opportunities for savings generation with the cheaper prices of goods and the reduction of administrative cost associated with procurement. More over, it provides a procurement framework where opportunities for administrative corruption are reduced. This leads to the conclusion that the centralized procurement system is efficient in that it reduces administrative processing time and concomitant costs. This, in the long run, will benefit the procuring entities and ultimately the tax payers. However, the emphasis placed on achieving administrative savings is at the expense of other measures of effectiveness such as quality of goods being supplied and the quality of services being extended to client agencies. Moreover, the lack of effective inventory and control system may pave the way to greater waste. Without an effective inventory and control system as well as an improved quality control system, the centralized procurement system that works faster and cheaper may not be better after all.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regional procurement service depots</field><field name="subject">public administration</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">public procurement</field><field name="subject">centralised procurement system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360202 Public administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/835</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalable wavelet packet based perceptual audio coding scheme</field><field name="creator">Sinaga, Ferdinan, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conventional perceptual coding algorithms do not normally exploit the temporal masking property of the human auditory system. These algorithms rely only on simultaneous masking models to calculate the masking threshold. This work proposes the use of a temporal masking model, combined with a simultaneous masking model, in wavelet packet-based audio coding. The result is a reduction in bit rate of approximately 25 kbps while preserving the transparent perceptual quality of audio signals, at a sampling rate of 16 kHz. This is achieved by a more accurate calculation of the combined auditory masking threshold. Another proposed approach of calculating the masking threshold accurately is by oversampling in the discrete wavelet transform. Most of the current wavelet based perceptual coders use the critically sampled discrete wavelet transform. The problem with this transform is aliasing, resulting from the down sampling process after each decomposition. This aliasing is cancelled in the decoding process, however the masking threshold calculation is done using aliased wavelet coefficients. Oversampling in the discrete wavelet transform is proposed in this work to avoid aliasing. The results show that by oversampling in the discrete wavelet transform, a reduction in a bit rate of up to 16 kbps can be achieved for audio signal, at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. The two approaches are then used in scalable audio coding in developing a fixed bit rate audio coder. The bit rate saving from the two approaches is used in scalable audio coding to include additional frequency content at the target bit rate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26130</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of epiphytic bacteria on the marine red alga Delisea pulchra</field><field name="creator">Longford, Sharon Rae, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bacteria are ubiquitous to marine living surfaces, taking on a broad spectrum of roles from mutualistic to pathogenic. Despite their universality, much remains unknown about their basic ecology and interactions with higher organisms. To address this gap, this thesis firstly examines the bacterial communities associated with three co-occurring marine eukaryote hosts from temperate Australia: the demosponge Cymbastela concentrica, the subtidal red macroalga Delisea pulchra and the intertidal green macroalga Ulva australis. Molecular characterisation of the bacterial communities was undertaken using 16S rRNA gene library analysis to compare within-host (alpha) and between-host (beta) diversity for the three microbial communities. This study highlights the potentially substantial contribution host-associated microorganisms could have on marine microbial diversity. The remaining focus for this thesis was on the bacterial community associated with D. pulchra. This alga produces a suite of biologically active secondary metabolites (furanones) that non-toxically inhibit acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-driven quorum sensing in bacteria, affecting a range of phenotypes including colonisation and virulence traits. The ecology of D. pulchra???s epiphytic bacteria was investigated using a mechanistic approach to explain bacterial colonisation patterns. In particular, concepts and models of ecological succession founded in eukaryote ecology were investigated. The thesis concludes with a study investigating the effect of furanones and elevated temperature on bacteria-induced disease and thallus bleaching of D. pulchra. In the presence of furanones colonisation and infection of two Roseobacter isolates from D. pulchra???s epiphytic bacterial community were inhibited. Ruegeria strain R11 was demonstrated to have temperature regulated virulence, which caused thallus bleaching in furanone-free algae. The implications of elevated sea temperatures resulting from global warming for algal health are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Succession.</field><field name="subject">Delisea pulchra.</field><field name="subject">Epiphytic bacteria.</field><field name="subject">Bacterial community ecology.</field><field name="subject">Epiphytes.</field><field name="subject">Bacteria.</field><field name="subject">Ecology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/36783</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization and optimization of low-swing on-chip interconnect circuits</field><field name="creator">Irfansyah, Astria Nur, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Low-swing on-chip interconnect circuits have been viewed as alternative solutions to the problem of delay and power increase of on-chip interconnects. This thesis aims to characterize and optimize several basic low-swing interconnect circuits, by developing simple delay and power estimation methodologies. Accuracies of the proposed methods are validated against SPICE-based simulations on the 90nm technology node. Based on the delay and power estimation methods developed, optimum power-delay trade-off curves are obtained and directly used for comparison among different interconnect circuit strategies. Three low-swing techniques are included, i.e. conventional level converter (CLC), pseudodifferential interconnect circuit (PDIFF), and current-mode signaling (CM). These techniques represent significantly different driver and receiver topologies, where CLC uses lower supply voltage of a normal inverter driver, PDIFF uses NMOS only drivers, while CM has a low impedance termination at the receiving end.  In addition, an optimized full-swing repeater-based technique is included as a baseline for comparison. A simplified repeater performance estimation technique considering ramp input signals is also proposed.  The most important step in estimating delay of different driver circuits is the accurate estimation of transistor effective resistance, which considers velocity saturation effects and voltage transition patterns.  Optimization for the CM circuit for on-chip interconnects requires completely different treatment than the voltage-mode circuits, due to the different and more complex effective driver resistance and termination resistance modeling. Sizing the driver and receiver transistors should be done simultaneously as their resistive values which affect its performance are dependent on each other. Optimum transistor sizing is very dependenton the required voltage swing chosen.  Results of our comparisons show that optimized CLC (reduced voltage supply) repeaters appears to give the best general performance with a slight delay overhead compared to full-swing repeaters. The fact that CLC with repeaters has shorter delay than single-segment CM and PDIFF highlights the effectiveness of repeater structures in long wires.  The inclusion of inductance and closed-form solutions to derive optimum transistor sizings for various low-swing interconnect circuits may be developed as a future work using delay and power estimation models presented in this thesis, which is a challenging task to do considering the non-linear equations involved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">current-mode signaling</field><field name="subject">on-chip interconnects</field><field name="subject">low-swing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/37158</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The harp extended: an exploration of resonance, mimicry and improvisation</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Clare Mary, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research project explores methods of extension of the pedal Harp vocabulary in an attempt to develop a unique language that challenges the instrument's stereotype and better responds to a range of contexts. I have investigated three key areas of extension: the physical structure of the Harp and its internal resonant spaces, mimicry as an exploratory tool useful in better understanding the Harp in relation to the Australian environment, and improvisation both free and structured used to challenge the vocabulary of the Harp in solo performance and collaborative contexts. The research stems from my longstanding curiosity with regards to the limits that a sanctioned or stereotyped repertoire of sounds and techniques places on an instrument for those who engage both as players and listeners. This critical commentary documents the results of the three areas of exploration indicated above as well as exploratory practice undertaken by other Harpists, it also discusses the problematic term 'extended techniques??? and draws on interviews conducted with progressive Harpists and improvisers with regards to extending the vocabulary of their own instruments. The sixty concerts I have performed internationally over the research period have also been central to my research. The final work consists of three elements: a solo Improvised Harp performance in my family home in suburban Sydney (filmed and recorded), a recording of Second Stabbing (Ohnedaruth), a Harp-lead composition by my Berlin-based ensemble: Hammeriver, and a series of three short studies composed of recordings of the resonant spaces inside the Harp entitled Spinal Fluid. All four pieces draw from and address what I have learnt from exploring the resonant physical structure, mimicry and improvisation. The result is a unique language that challenges the stereotypical profile of the Harp as a decorative instrument by embracing both its unique resonance and capacity for darkness, subtlety and texture. This language allows for a more flexible response to a broader range of contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39899</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental disorder amongst people of Vietnamese background: prevalence, trauma and culture</field><field name="creator">Steel, Zachary, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The role that culture and trauma plays in shaping mental health outcomes continues to dominate debate in the field of transcultural and post-conflict mental health. The broad aim of this thesis is to investigate key issues relevant to these two factors in relation to the Vietnamese. A meta-analysis of international epidemiological research indicated that countries of North and South East Asia appear to manifest low rates of mental disorder compared to English-speaking countries. A meta-regression analysis of research undertaken specifically with refugee and conflict-affected populations, confirmed a robust association between torture and general trauma and risk to mental disorder. 	The thesis then examines data from three population-based mental health surveys: 1,161 Vietnamese-Australian residents in the state of New South Wales; 3,039 Vietnamese resident in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam; and 7,961 Australian-born persons drawn from a national survey. All surveys applied the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, with the Vietnamese surveys also applying the Phan Vietnamese Psychiatric Rating Scale, an indigenously-derived measure of mental disorder.  The ICD-10 classification system yielded lowest rates amongst Vietnamese in the Mekong Delta, intermediate amongst Vietnamese in NSW; and highest rates amongst the Australian-born population. The Phan Vietnamese Psychiatric Rating Scale added a substantial number of cases in both Vietnamese samples. The findings suggest that sole reliance on a western-derived measure of mental disorder may fail to identify a cases of mental disorder across cultures. Trauma remained a substantial risk factor for mental disorder amongst Australian Vietnamese accounting for a substantial portion of the total burden of mental disorder in that population. The implications of these findings in developing a more refined model for understanding the mental health consequences of mass trauma across cultures are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental Disorder</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40888</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A lung cancer patterns of care study in the South Western Sydney Area Health Service</field><field name="creator">Vinod, Shalini Kavita, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: The South Western Sydney Area Health Service (SWSAHS) contains many areas of socio-economic disadvantage and ethnic diversity. It has a high incidence of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths. The aims of this study were to document lung cancer patterns of care (POC) for SWSAHS residents, compare POC before and after the opening of an oncology centre in SWSAHS and compare POC with other areas in NSW. Methods: The study population consisted of SWSAHS residents diagnosed with lung cancer in 1993 and 1996. A clinical audit of medical records was performed to extract details on patient demographics, management of lung cancer and outcomes. Collaborating investigators performed identical studies in the Northern Sydney Area Health Service (NSAHS) and the Hunter Area Health Service (HAHS) for lung cancers diagnosed in 1996. Results: The SWSAHS study population comprised 527 patients. Nine percent did not have a pathological diagnosis. Twelve percent did not see a lung cancer specialist. Twenty-eight percent did not receive any treatment throughout the course of their illness. The median survival was 6.7 months and five-year actuarial survival was 8% (95% CI 6%-10%). Increasing age and poorer performance status were associated with a lower likelihood of obtaining a pathological diagnosis, specialist referral and treatment. Socio-economic factors did not influence POC.  The establishment of an oncology center resulted in more referrals to medical oncologists and palliative care services. Other aspects of POC and survival were similar. Variability in POC was noted between SWSAHS, NSAHS and HAHS. HAHS residents were almost twice as likely not to have pathological confirmation of diagnosis or treatment. Despite this survival was not significantly different. Conclusions: This study has identified deficiencies in the management of lung cancer. To improve outcomes, referral to specialists and utilisation of treatment, particularly radiotherapy and chemotherapy, needs to be increased. Ageist and nihilistic attitudes need to be overcome. Prospective data collection is necessary to ensure quality of patient care. The formation of national guidelines for the management of lung cancer will play an important role in achieving better outcomes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">patients</field><field name="subject">care</field><field name="subject">lungs</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">health service areas</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">South Western Sydney</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22463</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of maintainer behaviour occurring during software maintenance</field><field name="creator">Parkin, Peter, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent years many tools and techniques have been proposed and even implemented which support maintenance programmers to gain an understanding of existing source code. However, studies have found that some tools are of marginal benefit and not appropriate for all maintenance tasks. This may be due to tools having been designed with little regard to the common behavioural practices that occur during software maintenance tasks because the current state of knowledge of such practices is quite limited. The aim of this study is to alleviate the above situation by performing a detailed behavioural analysis of software maintenance tasks undertaken under laboratory experiment conditions. To support this aim an experiment was conducted in which twenty-nine student subjects experienced in C programming independently undertook one of two maintenance tasks on the same C program in a university environment. The data produced from the experiment included subjects??? interactions with documents and code and their responses to program comprehension questions at the end of the task. The results indicate that maintenance task success is associated with a heightened concentration on high-level procedures that control the execution of lower level procedures. Among subjects, IT industry experience was linked to efficient comprehension of program and task documentation and the performance of more code searches. In general, code searches mainly involved searches for procedure name references. Compared to subjects undertaking the enhancement task, subjects performing the complex corrective task utilised program documentation more but also obtained a greater understanding of the elementary operations and control-flow of the program. In addition, this study illustrates a method to identify common information usage strategies from the recorded maintenance behaviour of subjects. Largely unsuccessful attempts were also made to sequentially analyse maintenance behaviour. This lack of success is possibly attributable to the as-needed comprehension approach adopted by subjects. The results of this research suggest that cost-effective maintenance of software is best supported using tools implementing facilities for feature location and visualisation of the control-flow of a program. The former facility would be most helpful to maintainers undertaking corrections, whereas the latter would particularly assist maintainers undertaking enhancements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software maintenance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23336</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practitioner Experience of a Developing Professional Learning Community</field><field name="creator">Coulson, Shirley Ann</field><field name="description">Australian policy contexts are promoting school transformation through teacher learning and the development of schools as professional learning communities. However, Australian practitioners have very limited contextualised research to guide their efforts in response to these policies. The researcher&#8217;s involvement in a school revitalisation process provided the impetus for this research study that investigates the practitioner experience of a developing professional learning community at RI College (pseudonym for a large independent girls&#8217; school in Brisbane). This study endeavours to gain a more informed and sophisticated understanding of developing a professional learning community with the intention of &#8216;living&#8217; this vision of RI College as a professional learning community. Praxis-oriented research questions focus on the practitioner conceptualisation of their school as a developing professional community and their experience of supporting/hindering strategies and structures. The study gives voice to this practitioner experience through the emerging participatory/co-operative research paradigm, an epistemology of participative inquiry, a research methodology of co-operative inquiry and mixed methods data collection strategies. Incorporating ten practitioner inquiries over two years, recursive cycles of action/reflection engaged practitioners as co-researchers in the collaborative reflective processes of a professional learning community while generating knowledge about the conceptualisation and supporting/hindering influences on its development. The outcomes of these first-person and second-person inquiries, together with a researcher devised online survey of teachers, were both informative and transformative in nature and led to the development of the researcher&#8217;s theoretical perspectives in response to the study&#8217;s research questions. As outcomes of co-operative inquiry, these theoretical perspectives inform the researcher&#8217;s future actions and offer insights into existing propositional knowledge in the field. Engagement in this practitioner inquiry research has had significant transformative outcomes for the co-researchers and has demonstrated the power of collaborative inquiry in promoting collective and individual professional learning and personal growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher learning</field><field name="subject">Professional learning communities</field><field name="subject">Education practitioners</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp194.07052009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jesus and the Cross: necessity, meaning and atonement</field><field name="creator">Laughlin, Peter Rod</field><field name="description">The proliferation of alternative models of atonement in recent academic literature, many of which stand in complete contrast to the traditional teachings of the Church, raises the question of how to determine faithfulness to the Christian doctrine of redemption. This thesis contends that such determination can be made when the alternative model proposed is able to demonstrate sufficient continuity with the meaning that Jesus of Nazareth constituted for his death. To argue this point requires a five stage investigation. Firstly the recent rejection, both academic and popular, of the so-called &#8216;myth&#8217; of redemptive suffering, insists that it be demonstrated that God can create meaning out of the contingent &#8211; and evil &#8211; event of the cross without becoming responsible for, or the transcendent cause of, Jesus&#8217; death. Taking a firm classical theistic stance it is argued that God can in no way will the death of Jesus because, as an evil contingent event, the cross falls outside the intelligibility of the divine providential order. Therefore, God is freely able to create meaning (ex nihilo) out of the event without validating and justifying the violence of the event itself. In addition, the upholding of a Chalcedonian Christology requires that the meaning which Jesus of Nazareth constituted for his death be understood to have divine significance, and thus should be investigated for what it reveals to a theological understanding of the cross. This leads to the second stage of the investigation which is to defend the theological right to engage in matters of history. Arguing for the value of critical realism, the point is made that a faith perspective does not negate the possibility of objective historical knowledge since, contrary to postmodernism, such knowledge does arise out of a spiralling dialogue between the knower and the object known. The third stage then follows, which is to argue how historical investigation into the Jesus of history might be done. Building upon James Dunn&#8217;s conception of impact, this study appropriates Bernard Lonergan&#8217;s understanding of constitutive meaning in order to highlight how the world of meaning that Jesus constituted for his death might actually function to impact the world of meaning of his followers. It is argued that what takes place is the constitution of a new world of meaning in which authentic existence is redefined. This redefinition challenges the disciples&#8217; existing world of meaning and requires that they make an existential judgement of their own. But if such an impact is to occur then the challenge to the existing world of meaning must also be carried and it is here that historical investigation has its place. Drawing once more on the work of Bernard Lonergan, five carriers of meaning are identified, three of which (incarnate, linguistic and symbolic) are highlighted as the most relevant. The fourth stage of the investigation ensues, which is an engagement with recent historical Jesus research particularly that associated with N.T. Wright, James Dunn, Scot McKnight and Ben Meyer. The purpose here is not to develop a portrait of the historical Jesus for ourselves but to engage with existing research in a theologically fruitful way. Here then, we ask what can be known about Jesus&#8217; intention for the cross by means of the incarnate, linguistic and symbolic carriers of meaning. Completing the examination yields the conclusion that Jesus intended his death to have redemptive significance but such significance must be understood within the framework of Jesus&#8217; mission to inaugurate the kingdom of God. The fifth and final stage is to address how a contemporary understanding of that redemptive judgement should be appropriated for a modern atonement motif. Primarily this is a movement from judgement to understanding, the contention being that a &#8216;faithful&#8217; motif will be one that takes due consideration of the judgement of faith, which seeks fuller understanding.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jesus Christ</field><field name="subject">Theology</field><field name="subject">Atonement</field><field name="subject">Redemption</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp195.08052009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Case Study of the Implementation of Children&#8217;s Literacy Success Strategy: The perceptions of principals, literacy co-ordinators and teachers</field><field name="creator">Lovelock, Mary Therese</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to examine the perceptions of principals, literacy co-ordinators and teachers on the implementation of Children&#8217;s Literacy Success Strategy (CLaSS) as a literacy and professional development strategy and their insights for future literacy innovation. CLaSS is a whole-school and sector approach to literacy for the early years of schooling. Introduced in 1998 to Catholic primary schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne, schools implementing CLaSS were supported by a professional development model throughout the implementation. CLaSS introduced to many schools a two-hour daily literacy block, data-driven instruction and the incorporation of professional learning teams within the professional development model. Eleven participants from two Catholic primary schools in the Archdiocese of Melbourne formed a case study for this research. The participants&#8217; perceptions were captured qualitatively and viewed interpretively based on a phenomenological approach. The research had significant findings. Participants endorsed the literacy strategy and the professional development model as an effective approach. In particular, the findings identified that the professional learning teams played a key role in developing and maintaining a culture of learning within the literacy team. This culture of learning assisted in improving learning outcomes for their students. While there was an endorsement of CLaSS, the findings also showed that there were some significant issues raised by participants. This included issues in professional development and student achievement in the areas of comprehension and writing. The findings indicated that professional understanding and student improvement in these areas were not as developed as those for decoding words in reading. Participants also indicated that assessment of student writing was limited by the absence of sector-wide assessment of different genres and, therefore, they were not confident in measuring student improvement in writing. The findings also identified some areas of difficulty within the professional development model, such as catering for individual learning styles and the addition of new team members to the literacy team. The findings indicated that for future literacy innovation, participants would prefer an approach that encompassed literacy and teacher development across the whole school. Based on the participants&#8217; responses, the research also provided recommendations and suggestions for further research in literacy. The recommendations included examining ways in which oral language and new literacies could have more prominence in the literacy block and providing a sector approach to assessment and specific professional development on comprehension and writing. The recommendations also suggested further research could be conducted as to ascertain the extent to which teachers require further professional development in comprehension and writing, how oral language is developed in other schools, and whether leadership has been the significant factor in sustaining the success of the literacy strategy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literacy</field><field name="subject">Children&#8217;s Literacy Success Strategy (CLaSS)</field><field name="subject">Catholic primary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp196.08052009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practising Inclusion within the Regular School Setting: students with special needs and their Aprender experience</field><field name="creator">Rodezno, Napoleon</field><field name="description">The experiences of students with special needs attending regular schools, their involvement and achievement within their school setting, and the theoretical underpinnings directing and determining what is best practice and delivery of effective education, have been an area of on-going change and development over the last 30 years. Teaching and learning processes involved in the effective pedagogical practice of special education have been consistently evolving, providing schools with developing options to enhance effective education practice for all students regardless of any academic, social and/or physical differences and subsequent needs. This study researches the experiences of students defined as having an intellectual disability who attend &#8220;Aprender&#8221;, a special program catering to the students&#8217; special needs within the framework of a regular school setting. These students are eligible to attend a special school due to their individual circumstances, yet they have chosen to attend a regular Catholic school. The study examines the experiences of the students as they participate in the program, by documenting their voice through their school journeys within the social, locational and academic inclusive participation as members of their school community. The research consisted of a longitudinal case study and methods used included interviews, observations, field notes and surveys. The study findings identify the value of relationships as a key element determining the success of inclusive practice within the Aprender program, in particular the peer relations that existed between the participants, their teachers and other students. The study also identified the theme of development, with strong emphasis placed on the examination of academic, social and emotional growth within the experiences of the students. The study illustrates the difficulties that the students with special needs encounter in their educational setting, in particular the social and academic challenges that affects their inclusion. These experiences contributed to determining the success of the approaches structured to support the students&#8217; inclusion in the program. The study found that the program was largely successful in its aims to include SWSN in a regular school setting, though some aspects of a holistic inclusion were less successful, and offers recommendations for further improvement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inclusion</field><field name="subject">Students with special needs</field><field name="subject">Intellectual disabilities</field><field name="subject">Aprender program</field><field name="subject">Catholic secondary schools</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp197.08052009</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Movements and the Limits of Strategy: How Australian Feminists Formed Positions on Work and Care</field><field name="creator">Andrew, Merrindahl</field><field name="description">Feminism is often blamed for having made the 'wrong decisions' on issues such as work and care. This thesis argues that such judgements are based on a misperception of how social movements exercise collective agency. While feminist historiography and social movement studies offer some insights, neither directly address the question of to what extent the directions taken by social movements can be shaped by high level strategic decision-making. In answering this question, the research was informed by philosophical pragmatism and by feminist theories of responsibility and reason. The prevailing 'movement CEO' image of decision-making was rejected in favour of an approach directed to interpreting the past actions of the women&#146;s movement without neglecting its decentralised and collective nature. 
&#182;
I began by investigating the degree of strategy in Australian women&#146;s movement activism on work and care issues in two periods: the interwar years (1919&#150;1938) and in the 1970s and 1980s. These periods were chosen because they are often taken to illustrate failures in feminist decision-making. The second-wave movement is said to have failed women by over-emphasising access to paid work at the expense of women&#146;s caring roles while the feminists of the early twentieth century are said to have locked women into mothering roles by relying on maternalist arguments. The historical research drew on primary sources including the records created by organisations and individuals involved in the movement, together with oral history interviews. The historical studies found little evidence of capacity for, or orientation towards, high level strategic decision-making in terms of the political and discursive risks identified in later criticisms of feminism. The studies supplement existing historical accounts by illuminating the nature of organisational processes within the movement and the reasoning used by participants. 
&#182;
I then developed a positive alternative to existing rational actor models of decision making, which avoids the assumption that movements as such engage in strategic decision-making but still allows for the possibility of purposive collective action. This 'organisation-direction' model proposes that collective intentions may be formed in the more densely-organised nodes of a movement field and may pull the movement in certain directions without imposing high-level strategic decisions. Non instrumental elements such as emotion and movement knowledge are irreducible parts of reasoned action, which only sometimes involves assessing risks and opportunities. Movement goals and means are generated in the course of practical engagement rather than through a linear process of decision-making. The thesis contributes to the social movement literature that emphasises the constitutive role of non-instrumental elements of action by showing how these are linked to goal-oriented organisation. The thesis responds to the growing emphasis on strategic choices in social movements by exploring the nature and limits of strategy instead of assuming its usefulness as an interpretive device.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social movements</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">activism</field><field name="subject">work and care</field><field name="subject">strategy</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="subject">action</field><field name="subject">pragmatism</field><field name="subject">organisation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090508.155410</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of image analysis for studing mite behaviour</field><field name="creator">Bowie, Mike H.</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of image analysis for studying mite behaviour. Image analysis was used to convert video recordings of mites' locomotory behaviour into a series of x,y coordinates that, when joined, closely resemble the paths of mites. The coordinates were also used to calculate walking speed, direction of travel, turning frequency, turn bias and tortuosity. Two experimental arenas were developed and used to study the movement of three mite species: 1) a leaf disc arena for two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch and European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch); and 2), a cover-slip/tack-trap arena for Typhlodromus pyri Scheuten. Two-spotted spider mite exhibited a change in locomotory behaviour through a 48 minute period. Mites exhibited a significant decline in distance travelled, whereas the mean stationary time (per four minute interval) more than doubled, and the duration of stationary events increased steadily over the same period. A reduction in sampling frequency of mite coordinates from one per second to one every two seconds and every four seconds produced a 5% and 12% 'loss' in path length respectively. Sample period length was shown to greatly influence the results produced for some of the mean parameters calculated, however, a reduction in sample length from 3000 to 1500 coordinates was not considered to cause a major loss in information. The influence of the inherent mite movement could not be ignored and made it difficult to make decisions on the 'best' sample length to use. Some strong correlations were found between parameters used to analyse mite locomotory behaviour. In particular, arithmetic mean vector length, speed, total stationary time and total distance travelled were significantly correlated with each other. Mean angular deviation and weighted mean vector length, which both measure the degree of clustering around the mean heading angle, were strongly negatively correlated. Parameters which differentiated between 'straight' and 'tortuous' mite movement were found to be mean meander, absolute mean turn and fractal dimensions. Mean meander was thought to be the most 'powerful', while coefficient of a straight line, a commonly used parameter for measuring tortuosity, did not significantly differentiate between the two different behaviours. Frequency distributions of turns and standard deviations of the three mite species were very similar. All three species had a slight bias to turning right (clockwise) rather than  to the left (counter-clockwise) and for each species certain angles occurred more often than would be expected in a 'perfect' normal distribution. A similar pattern also occurred with the frequency distribution of two-spotted spider mite heading angles, in that angles which were expected to occur more often, did not, and vice versa. The potential to use saturated salt solutions to control relative humidity on the arena was` demonstrated and indicated that relative humidity is likely to have an important influence on mite behaviour. Two-spotted spider mites appeared to move more quickly in an attempt to escape the unfavourable, extreme (10% and 95% R.H. at 25&#176;C) moisture conditions. All three mite species displayed a characteristic edge-walking behaviour around the arenas. However, when 'edge' and 'non-edge' behaviours were compared, mean meander was the only parameter (of the parameters tested) which gave a significant difference. Behavioural responses of European red mite and T. pyri to sub-lethal (field rate) esfenvalerate were investigated and the results indicated that these mites did not seek the unsprayed halves of the arenas during the first 48 minutes. However, significant differences in most behavioural parameters to esfenvalerate residues were found with European red mite when whole arenas were compared. Image analysis is an extremely useful research tool for studying mite behaviour because of its ability to measure many parameters quickly. Careful choice of the environmental conditions, the sampling framework, and interpretation of data is essential for meaningful results.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">locomotory behaviour</field><field name="subject">two-spotted spider mite</field><field name="subject">Tetranychus urticae</field><field name="subject">European red mite</field><field name="subject">Panonychus ulmi</field><field name="subject">Typhlodromus pyri</field><field name="subject">esfenvalerate</field><field name="subject">sub-lethal effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280203 Image processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1056</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of cold maceration with and without sulphur dioxide on pinot noir wine</field><field name="creator">Dicey, M.</field><field name="description">The effects of varying levels of sulphur dioxide (SO&#8322;) on the cold maceration process was investigated with Pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) wine. The effects of these varying levels on the wines composition and colour parameters were examined. Cold maceration is a technique whereby grapes are crushed and placed at low temperatures (4 - lO&#176;C) in the presence 50 - 150 mgL&#8315;&#185; SO&#8322;. This process is believed to provide a medium for the extraction of water soluble phenolic compounds, rather than the alcoholic extraction employed in normal fermentations. The extraction of these phenolic compounds was monitored from the juice through to six months of bottle age. The changes were measured using both Spectrophotometric and High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) procedures. Cold maceration wines were found to be not significantly different to the control wine in all compositional parameters other than titrateable acidity which was found to be less than the control for all the cold maceration wines. The unsulphured cold maceration wine was not significantly different from the control wine in any of the spectral measurements except natural degree of ionisation, in which it was higher, and total phenolics, in which it was lower. These results indicate that the cold maceration process alone does not alter the extraction of phenolic compounds. The HPLC analysis of the wine confirmed the spectral results indicating that their were no significant differences in the levels of extraction of anthocyanins. The sulphured cold maceration wines were significantly greater than the control in visible colour, colour density, total anthocyanins, natural degree of ionisation, ionised anthocyanins and total phenolics. These results followed similar patterns with wine ageing, at six months these wines were still significantly greater in all the measurements apart from natural degree of ionisation. The results for the sulphured cold maceration wines indicates that SO&#8322; is acting as a solvent for the extraction of phenolic compounds including anthocyanins. The 50 mgL&#8315;&#185; SO&#8322; cold maceration wine had similar colour and phenolic content to the 100 mgL&#8315;&#185; SO&#8322; cold maceration wine at bottling, at six months the 50 mgL&#8315;&#185; SO&#8322; cold maceration wine still retained a similar colour to the 100 mgL&#8315;&#185; SO&#8322; cold maceration wine but had vastly reduced anthocyanin content. This indicates that for the grapes utilised in this study the most appropriate level of addition at cold maceration would be 50 mgL&#8315;&#185; of SO&#8322;. With grapes of differing phenolic content the level of addition required will vary.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinot noir</field><field name="subject">wine</field><field name="subject">cold maceration</field><field name="subject">phenolic</field><field name="subject">anthocyanin</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1057</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sireline variation in neonatal lamb cold tolerance</field><field name="creator">Gudex, B. W.</field><field name="description">The cost of lamb mortality caused by cold exposure has been estimated at approximately 40 million dollars per year. This value is probably conservative as it does not include the cost due to the reduction in productivity in hypothermic lambs that manage to survive or the cost of reduced selection potential incurred by fewer lambs surviving until selection. The objectives of this research was to investigate whether sire-line variation exists in neonatal lamb cold tolerance and whether polymorphism in the &#946;&#8323; adrenergic receptor gene can be used as a genetic marker for lamb cold tolerance and lean muscle growth. The influence of the climate, birthweight, age of dam at lambing, gender and birth rank on neonatal lamb cold tolerance was also analysed. Neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure was analysed in four field trials that used neonatal lamb morality from cold exposure as a predictor of neonatal lamb cold tolerance. Sire-line variation in neonatal lamb morality was observed in all trials, though it appeared that this effect was largely mediated through sire-line variation in lamb birth weight. Variation in lamb birth weight between birth rank classed was also found to be responsible for the influence of birth rank on neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure. The age of dam at lambing and the lamb gender was not observed to influence neonatal lamb mortality due to cold exposure. The sires from the cold tolerance study and the progeny of the lean muscle growth study were genotyped for the &#946;&#8323; adrenergic receptor locus. Other studies have found evidence that a major gene exists in the catecholamine stimulation of brown adipose thermogenesis and evidence that the &#946;&#8323;-AR gene is a likely candidate. However, this hypothesis and the hypothesis that polymorphism in the &#946;&#8323;-AR gene is also linked to lean muscle growth in lambs was not confirmed in this study. So while it appears that the results were confounded by experimental design, there is evidence that influence of polymorphism in the ovine &#946;&#8323; AR gene on neonatal lamb mortality and/or lean muscle growth is not sufficient to be considered a major gene effect. The implications of this experiment on the sheep industry and sheep farmers in general are huge. While completely eliminating lamb deaths due to inadequate cold tolerance is impossible, this study shows that large gains in lamb survival could be possible through selective breeding.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">Ovis aries</field><field name="subject">cold tolerance</field><field name="subject">lean muscle growth</field><field name="subject">birthweight</field><field name="subject">&#946;&#8323;-adrenergic receptor</field><field name="subject">Beta3 adrenergic receptor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1055</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of subsidiaries: the case of michelin in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Sakolvieng, Ketkamol, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study has investigated the evolution of Michelin Siam Group (MSG), a Thai subsidiary of the Michelin Group (France), over the period between 1987 and 2007. Particular attention has been given to the process of changing subsidiary roles as well as factors influencing the process. The study has adopted a qualitative case-study approach based on the data collected from interviews of senior managers at MSG. The analysis has demonstrated that over the past 20 years, MSG has undergone several changes in its charters and capabilities, with the changes in its roles accordingly. In its early years (pre-1997), MSG was a ??local implementer?? in its MNC network, mainly serving the local market in a limited range of product lines mandated by the headquarters (HQs). Its charters, both manufacturing and commercial charters, have since been extended to cover broader product lines and international markets beyond Thailand through the accumulation of production capabilities enhanced by a range of training programmes. MSG has thus increasingly shifted from a ??local implementer?? to a ??regional/global implementer??. More importantly, it has also been revealed that the changes in MSG??s roles have been strongly influenced by the HQs. Through its control over decision making, the HQs has been heavily involved in introducing changes at MSG. However, the role of subsidiary, industry, and local environment factors should not be neglected. MSG??s increasing capabilities and superior performance coupled with the favourable and dynamic local environment as well as the competitive nature of an industry have been found to have instigated HQs?? favourable decisions for MSG. While the HQs has been the dominant driver of MSG??s roles and changes in its roles, the findings of this study largely appear to support the influences of the interplay of corporate, subsidiary, industry, and local environment factors in shaping subsidiary roles over time.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subsidiary roles</field><field name="subject">subsidiary evolution</field><field name="subject">MNC subsidiary management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43381</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differentiation and migration of Sca-1+/CD 31-cardiac side population cells in a mouse infarction model</field><field name="creator">Tan, Yew Liang Terence, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure and remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in humans. Stem cells are important in the maintenance and repair of adult tissues. Hoechst effluxing cells, termed side population cells are a rare subset of cells found in adult tissues that are highly enriched for stem and progenitor cell activity. Recent studies have suggested that Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells are capable of differentiation into cardiomyocytes in vitro. However, the response of cardiac side population cells to myocardial injury remains unknown in vivo. In this study, we directly transplanted Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells into an acutely infarcted mouse heart. After two weeks, the transplanted cells were found to express cardiomyocyte or endothelial cell markers. Importantly, when these cells were transplanted into a remote nonischemic part of the heart after MI, they were able to migrate to the damaged myocardium. Consistent with these cells homing property, we found that SDF-1&#945;, a chemotactic chemokine and its receptor, CXCR4 were up-regulated in the damaged myocardium and on Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac SP cells respectively following an acute myocardial infarction. We further showed that SDF-1&#945; was able to induce migration of Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells in vitro. Our results have therefore suggested that Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells are able to migrate to damaged myocardium from non-ischemic myocardium and differentiate into cardiomyocytes as well as endothelial cells in the acutely infarcted mouse heart. We postulate that the SDF-1&#945;/CXCR4 interaction may play an important role in the migration of these cells. Understanding and enhancing these processes may hold enormous potential possibilities for therapeutic myocardial regeneration for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac stem cells</field><field name="subject">myocardial infarction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brain reserve: a three year longitudinal neuropsychological and brain imaging examination of the ???use it or lose it??? principle</field><field name="creator">Valenzuela, Michael J., Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this dissertation was to increase scientific understanding of brain reserve. Chapter 1 describes how brain reserve has come to be viewed in two distinct ways: differential expression of brain injury on the basis of individual differences in gross brain properties (neurological), or on the basis of lifespan patterns of complex mental activity (behavioural). Evidence in the Alzheimer???s disease and ageing literature has been extensive, yet with conflicting reports. In order to better evaluate this evidence, a systematic review of cohort studies is the focus of Chapter 2. Complex mental activity was found to be associated with reduced incidence of dementia and slowed rate of cognitive decline. Neurological brain reserve evidence was limited. A major task of this dissertation was to develop a more standard and complete behavioural brain reserve instrument. Chapter 3 relates the development of the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) in a group of 86 healthy elderly. The LEQ had adequate levels of internal consistency and reliability. In a validation test, higher LEQ scores were also found to predict attenuated cognitive decline over 18 months independent of covariates including premorbid IQ. Chapter 4 describes how both LEQ (as a measure of behavioural brain reserve) and intracranial volume (as a measure of neurological brain reserve) significantly predicted cognitive decline over three years in a sample of 70 aged subjects. Total LEQ was furthermore significantly correlated with hippocampal volume independent of intracranial volume, and this association mediated the relationship with cognitive decline. Behavioural brain reserve may therefore work by protecting individuals from hippocampal atrophy. The fifth chapter explores therapeutic and neurobiological aspects of behavioural brain reserve in a preliminary fashion. A randomized-control mental activity trial was run with 20 healthy elderly who received repeat magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mental activity subjects were found to have selective and sustained upregulation of phosphocreatine metabolism in the hippocampal region, a finding of potential neuroprotective significance. Experience-dependent neuroplasticity is proposed as a unifying framework in the final chapter, allowing synthesis of the present findings and reconciliation of the neurological and behavioural approaches to brain reserve.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">brain imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23436</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlled trial of hypnotherapy as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome</field><field name="creator">Phillips-Moore, Julie</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irritable colon -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Irritable colon -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Irritable colon -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Hypnotism -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4983</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Song Sharing and Repertoire Change as Indicators of Social Structure in the Noisy Scrub-bird</field><field name="creator">aberryman@mail.com</field><field name="description">The Endangered Noisy Scrub-bird is a small passerine that is seldom seen but often heard in its range on the south coast of Western Australia. The difficulties in observing this cryptic bird mean that little is known about its social system. The loud, conspicuous territorial song of the male provides a convenient, non-intrusive means by which to study this species.

The aim of this project was to investigate the patterns of song sharing and repertoire change in the Noisy Scrub-bird to provide indications of the social structure. It was found that groups of up to ten territorial males shared the same set of about five song types. Song groups were discrete, with members of a song group sharing most, if not all, of their song types. Males from different song groups had no song types in common.

Repertoire change was rapid and, with the exception of one individual, was found in every territorial male studied in the Mt Gardner population. It occurred simultaneously in all members of a song group, with males making the same changes to their shared songs. The source of repertoire change was mainly modification of existing song types with occasional divergence of a single song type into two distinct song types, as well as some innovation providing new song types. The average life of a song type was approximately 6 months. Although some song types persisted for the entire 16 month sampling period, they were continually modified and a year later could no longer be recognised as the same type.

Translocation of eight male scrub-birds to the Porongurup National Park provided an opportunity to combine individuals that initially did not share any songs. This allowed the process of song group formation to be studied. Within a one to two month period these males altered their songs so that they shared with their new neighbours. There was some evidence that the songs of dominant males were copied. Observation of the population established on Bald Island by translocation confirmed that there were no appreciable long-term effects on the songs of translocated Noisy Scrub-birds. Song group size, repertoire size and levels of song sharing were very similar to those found in the Mt Gardner population.

The striking feature of Noisy Scrub-bird song groupings was their discreteness and cohesiveness even in the presence of continual repertoire change. It is suggested that each song group consists of a dominant male whose songs are more attractive to females and/or effective in territory defence. This dominant male is surrounded by subordinate males that copy his effective songs. Repertoire change can be explained by the dominant male continually making changes to his songs, with the other males copying these changes to retain their mimicked effectiveness. Each song group may in fact represent a dispersed lek. The scenario suggested to explain Noisy Scrub-bird song groupings bears striking similarities to the hotshot hypothesis to explain lek formation whereby males cluster around a successful male.

This study demonstrates the potential of using song to investigate aspects of the social system of a species which is otherwise very difficult to observe. Management of an Endangered species such as the Noisy Scrub-bird will always benefit from increased knowledge about their social system. For example, this study showed that taking males from different song groups for translocation probably has little impact on their success at the new site because of their ability to rapidly alter their songs to form new song groups. An additional benefit of regularly monitoring the songs of translocated males was that it allowed ongoing identification of individuals, even though their songs were continually changing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090421.125619</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathosystem development, characterisation and genetic dissection of the soil pathogen Phytophthora medicaginis and the model legume Medicago truncatula : a view to application of disease resistance in susceptible legume species</field><field name="creator">nolad@iprimus.com.au</field><field name="description">Phytophthora medicaginis is an important soil-borne oomycete pathogen of lucerne (Medicago sativa) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) within Australia and overseas. To understand the host/pathogen interaction, a pathosystem was developed using the model legume Medicago truncatula. Using the resources developed for genetics and molecular characterisation in this model plant, the aim of this research was to understand the interaction between M. truncatula and P. medicaginis, with a view to improving resistance to this important pathogen in related legumes.

To observe and characterise the interaction between M. truncatula and P. medicaginis, a pathosystem was developed by first screening a germplasm collection of 99 M. truncatula accessions. This revealed a continuous distribution in disease phenotypes with variable extremes in natural resistance to P. medicaginis culture UQ5750, isolated originally from M. sativa. P. medicaginis zoospore inoculation of 1-2 week-old seedlings in glasshouse experiments proved to be a robust and repeatable method to consistently confirm the responses observed for six key M. truncatula accessions; SA8618 and SA8623 exhibit high natural resistance to this pathogen, accession A17 is moderately resistant, A20 is moderately susceptible and accessions Borung and SA30199 are susceptible.

To characterise the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis, two reciprocal F2 populations from cross pollinations between A17 and Borung and SA8618 and SA30199 were produced and then phenotyped for disease symptoms. Genetic segregation patterns indicated the involvement of a gene with a major effect in both reciprocal populations. In particular, a 3:1 segregation ratio for resistance in the F2 populations from cross pollinations between A17 and Borung indicated the possibility of a single dominant gene for moderate resistance. Further phenotyping of F3 families is required to verify this.

A M. truncatula linkage map was constructed using 50 F2 individuals of the A17 X Borung population and 49 F2 individuals from the Borung X A17 population. The map, covering 519.3 cM, is comprised of 84 SSR markers with an average distance between markers of 8.7 cM. These are evenly spaced over 7 linkage groups, including a super linkage group conferred by a translocation event between LG4 and LG8 of accession A17.

Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis confirmed there was a QTL with a major effect in the A17/Borung reciprocal populations. A significant QTL was determined by quantifying two symptoms of P. medicaginis infection - proportion of dead/chlorotic leaves and root fresh weight. The trait loci for both symptoms were located on the same linkage group within the same region, supporting the putative position of the QTL and the authenticity of its involvement in resistance to P. medicaginis. This QTL was located on LG6 and accounted for 69.5% of the observed variation in proportion of dead/chlorotic leaves or 38.1% of the variation in root fresh weight within the inoculated populations. The effect of this QTL on resistance to P. medicaginis translated into 27.5% less dead/chlorotic leaves or 0.86 g more root fresh weight. Other QTLs with minor effects that are potentially involved in the interaction are located elsewhere on LG6 and LG2. However, the marker density of the linkage map and the population size need to be increased to verify this.

In parallel to this, an F7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population of chickpea (BG212 X Jimbour), developed by breeders at the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI), was also assessed for the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis. Variance component analysis of phenotype scores for this intraspecific RIL population indicated that 57.15% of the differences in between-family and withinfamily variance could be attributed to a genetic component. However, gene-based markers developed in M. truncatula and established simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers of chickpea were not sufficiently polymorphic in size to produce a linkage map for further QTL analysis.

An interspecific cross between C. arietinum and C. echinospermum (Howzat X ILWC246) was also performed by breeders at the NSW DPI to develop RILs. In the duration of this research these interspecific RILs were bred to generation F3 and phenotyping assessment had not been performed. However, marker screening of the parents revealed 122 size polymorphic chickpea SSR markers. A sufficient linkage map could be produced for QTL analysis once field assessment of this population is performed. Initial screening of the M. truncatula gene-based markers on the parents of this interspecific cross also revealed that 50% show a sequence-identified base pair difference. A chickpea linkage map incorporating these markers could be comparatively mapped with M. truncatula.

Molecular investigations of the M. truncatula/P. medicaginis pathosystem were performed to elucidate the possible underlying defence mechanisms involved in the observed resistance. To determine the function of ethylene in the resistant response, the characterisation of defence associated mutants of M. truncatula and Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated &#145;hairy root&#146; transformations were employed. Comparison of response to inoculation of an ethylene insensitive mutant of M. truncatula (sickle) with the moderately resistant background genotype A17 showed that sickle was hypersensitive to P. medicaginis. This indicated that ethylene insensitivity was not the source of resistance to this pathogen and importantly that ethylene is a key defence signalling molecule in the moderate resistance of A17 to P. medicaginis.

Agrobacterium-mediated &#145;hairy root&#146; transformations of M. truncatula with 4GCC::Luc constructs, revealed that the production of ethylene and consequently ethylene response factors (ERFs) after inoculation by P. medicaginis was a general defence reaction by all accessions. The two susceptible M. truncatula accessions exhibited a much stronger and earlier response to inoculation than the highly resistant and moderately resistant accessions. This indicated that the resistant response may be directed by a transcriptional component governed by the host genotype, downstream of ethylene production. The M. truncatula/P. medicaginis &#145;hairy root&#146; transformation assay has scope to be a powerful functional genomics tool for this pathogen interaction.

Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) was employed to determine the general patterns of gene expression and function underlying the response to P. medicaginis infection. Relative changes in gene expression of key enzymes in each of the salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, ethylene and isoflavonoid defence pathways and in genes encoding downstream target proteins revealed potential genes involved in the resistance to P. medicaginis. There was a distinct molecular difference in the response between the high and moderately resistant M. truncatula phenotypes to this pathogen. Moderate resistance to P. medicaginis in M. truncatula is possibly
mediated by ethylene and involves the considerable  induction of pathogenesis related protein 5 (PR5), which was not the same defence response that conferred the high resistance to P. medicaginis. Early and consistent expression of genes encoding key enzymes of the isoflavonoid pathway by the highly resistant accession indicated that phytoalexin response could be associated with the high resistance. Confirmation of the involvement of isoflavonoid phytoalexins in the high resistance response to P. medicaginis merits further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legumes</field><field name="subject">Diseases and pests</field><field name="subject">Soilborne pathogens</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090423.105414</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characteristics of fish communites in coastal waters of north-western Australia, including the biology of the threadfin species Eleutheronema tetradactylum and Polydactylus macrochir</field><field name="creator">matthew.pember@fish.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">This study was aimed at determining the characteristics of the fish assemblages in nearshore coastal waters of the remote Canning region of tropical Western Australia and to obtain sound quantitative data on crucial aspects of the biology of the two threadfin species, which are commercially and recreationally important in those waters. The community studies focused on comparing the species compositions of the fish faunas found over bare sand and in mangroves and rock pools and on elucidating the factors that influence those compositions. The population studies concentrated on exploring the hermaphroditic characteristics, size and age structures, growth and stock status of the two species of Polynemidae.

The arid Canning coast of north-western Australia, which lies between Cape Leveuque (16&#176;21'S, 123&#176;02'E) and Cape Keraudren (19&#176;57'S, 119&#176;46'E),does not contain rivers and thus also estuaries, which traditionally provide alternative fish nursery areas to those found in nearshore waters. It is also subjected to some of the largest tides in the world. The fish faunas at three widely-separated locations, i.e. Port Smith, Eighty Mile Beach and Cape Keraudren, were sampled using seine and gill netting in their shallow, nearshore waters and rotenoning in intertidal pools at the first and third of those locations with the aim of determining the following. 1) The extents to which the diversity, abundance and species composition of the fish faunas of the Canning coast are influenced by location, habitat and time of year. 2) Which species use bare sand, mangroves and/or intertidal pools as nursery areas and which are permanent residents in one or more of those habitats. 3) Identification of the commercial and recreational fish species found in each of the above three habitat types and their relative abundance in those habitats.

The fish catches from all three sampling locations collectively yielded 170 species representing 66 families. The most abundant species (with % contributions) in seine net samples collected over unvegetated sand were Stolephorus carpentariae (19.1), Herklotsichthys blackburni (14.7) and Atherinomorus lacunosus (11.8), whereas those in gill net samples taken over the same substrate were Arius proximus (26.6), Eleutheronema tetradactylum (18.8) and Polydactylus macrochir (18.7) and in mangroves were A. proximus (38.9), Valamugil buchanani (18.8) and Scomberoides commersonnianus (18.7). Ambassis vachellii (32.5) and Craterocephalus capreoli (14.4) dominated the catches obtained from intertidal pools.

Fifty three of the 170 species that were caught are fished commercially and recreationally along the Canning coast and a further 17 fish species are caught solely by recreational fishers. The most abundant of these species were the polynemids E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, which are residents of nearshore waters, i.e. are found in these waters throughout the whole of their life cycle. Other species, such as Lutjanus russelli Epinephelus coioides and Sillago vittata, are present in nearshore waters only as juveniles and thus use these waters as a nursery.

The compositions of the ichthyofaunal samples collected by both seine and gill nets over bare sand differed markedly among locations. The compositions at Cape Keraudren, the most southerly location, were more similar to those at Port Smith, the most northerly and most protected location, than those that Eighty Mile Beach, the most exposed of the three locations. It is thus proposed that the compositions of the fish faunas found in nearshore, unvegetated waters along the Canning coast are influenced more by factors related to turbidity than those reflecting latitudinal position. The fish fauna at Eighty Mile Beach was distinguished by species typically associated with turbid waters, such as those of the Polynemidae and Sciaenidae and certain species of the Engraulidae, Ariidae, Mugilidae and Carcharhinidae. In contrast, many of those species were absent from catches made in the clearer waters of Port Smith, where the ichthyofauna was disitinguished by certain species of the Clupeidae and Atherinidae and other species associated with low turbidity, such as V. buchanani and Chanos chanos.

The compositions of the fish faunas sampled over bare sand by gill and seine nets underwent marked seasonal changes. Furthermore, these changes, particularly in the case of seine net catches, tended to undergo a conspicuous cyclical progression during the year as a result of time-staggered changes in the recruitment and emigration of certain species. The species responsible for seasonal differences in either the gill and/or seine net samples included nearshore residents, such as the clupeids H. blackburni and Spratelloides delicatulus, the polynemids E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, the engraulidid Thryssa hamiltonii and the atherinids A. lacunosus and C. capreoli, as well as species such as the sillaginid S. vittata, which use nearshore waters as a nursery area. At a broader level, the compositions of the fish sampled by gill net in the wet and dry periods were also distinct, reflecting, in particular, the influx of certain species during the wet period, e.g. mature ariid catfish and the juveniles of a number of elasmobranchs, such as the endangered Green Sawfish Pristis zijsron, aggregate in nearshore, shallow waters during this period.

The fish faunas of the intertidal pools at Port Smith and Cape Keraudren, which were sampled using rotenone, differed markedly from each other and from those over nearby bare sand substrates on the coast. The ichthyofauna of intertidal pools at Port Smith was distinguished from that at Cape Keraudren by relatively greater numbers of C. capreoli at the former location, whereas the opposite situation pertained with Amniataba caudavittatus, Acanthopagrus latus and L. macrolepis at Cape Keraudren. These differences were attributable to differences in habitat characteristics of intertidal pools, with pools at the former location containing clearer water and greater amounts of rock, while those at the latter contained mangroves. Few species were caught in both intertidal pools and in the surrounding shallow, nearshore waters, demonstrating that the rock pools provide an important habitat for certain fish species.

The composition of the fish fauna of intertidal pools at Port Smith underwent an essentially cyclical progression over the course of a year, reflecting the timing and strength of recruitment of the juveniles of the various species. The species responsible for this recruitment-related change in the fish fauna included both nearshore residents, such as A. vachellii, C. capreoli and A. lacunosus, as well as transient species that use intertidal pools as a nursery area, i.e. E. coioides and L. russelli. In contrast, the seasonal progression in species composition in intertidal pools at Cape Keraudren was largely related to the influence of a tropical cyclone. The fish community in the period immediately following the cyclone was depauparate and distinguished, from that before the cyclone, in particular by a lack of A. vachellii and A. latus.

The Blue and King Threadfins E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, which were among the most abundant species in the seine and gill net catches taken in unvegetated waters, are key species in the Kimberley Managed Gill Net and Barramundi Fishery (KMGBF) and important recreational target species. In addition, these species are an important source of food and of cultural significance for local indigenous communities. The importance of the shared nature of these resources and the marked fluctuations undergone by the catches of threadfin in recent years led to the second major component of this thesis, i.e. to obtain reliable data on the reproductive biology, age compositions, growth rates and mortality of E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, of the type that are required by managers for developing plans to conserve the stocks of these species in north-western Australia.

Length and age compositions of male, bisexual (i.e. possessing gonads comprising both testicular and ovarian tissue) and female E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, and histological characteristics of the gonads of the full size range of threadfin were examined and analysed. The results demonstrate that, in north-western Australian waters, each of these species is a protandrous hermaphrodite, i.e. individuals mature first as males before changing sex to female. Sexual maturity is attained by 50% of male E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir at ca 200 and 230 mm, respectively. For both species, these lengths approximate those attained towards the end of their first year of life. However, the lengths and ages at which these two species typically change sex differ markedly.

In the case of E. tetradactylum, &#129;gtransitional&#129;h fish (i.e. those with bisexual gonads assumed to be changing sex) were most prevalent at total lengths between 300 and 400 mm. All fish greater than 450 mm total length possessed gonads that consisted exclusively of ovarian tissue. The L50 for sex change from male and transitional fish to females is ca 400 mm. Thus, the majority of E. tetradactylum change sex during their second or third years of life and males are rarely older than three years. In contrast, the range of lengths at which transitional individuals of P. macrochir were recorded was much broader than E. tetradactylum, i.e. between 310 and 1140 mm. The data on the prevalences of males and females in sequential age classes demonstrate that sex change can occur in P. macrochir as young as two years old and up to eight years old. The lengths at which E. tetradactylum changes sex in north-western Australia was relatively similar at all locations, whereas the L50 for sex change in P. macrochir varied markedly among sampling locations. For example, the L50 value for sex inversion was ca 790 mm at Derby, compared with ca 1160 mm at Anna Plains. The differences presumably reflect variations in environmental conditions at those localities. 

Analysis of the ages of male, transitional and female E. tetradactylum revealed that the change from male to female by this species occurs over a period of ca 6 months. The presence of mature sperm in transitional gonads, in combination with trends exhibited by the GSIs of the testicular and ovarian portions of transitional gonads, demonstrate that, during the spawning season, transitional threadfin function as males. Analyses indicate that, once individual E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir change sex to become females, all individuals function as mature females during successive breeding seasons. Both species of threadfin have protracted spawning periods of ca 6 months. However, the monthly trends exhibited by the mean GSIs and the proportion of the various gonad stages show that the spawning of both species peaks during spring and early summer, i.e. September to December, and occurs on multiple occasions each year.

In north-western Australia, P. macrochir grows far larger and lives for longer than E. tetradactylum, a difference reflected in the maximum total lengths and ages recorded for these two species, i.e. 1393 mm and 10 years vs 793 mm and 6 years, respectively. In addition, P. macrochir grows faster than E. tetradactylum, attaining lengths of 322, 520 and 945 mm vs 245, 400 and 635 mm, by the end of years 1, 2 and 5, respectively. For both species, estimates of total, natural and fishing mortality were derived using different life history models, simulation based on the number of fish in samples above a specified age, relative abundance analyses and a Monte Carlo resampling approach. 

The various biological parameters determined for E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, including the estimates of mortality, were incorporated into yield per recruit, spawning biomass per recruit and spawning potential ratio analyses to determine the current impacts of fishing on each species in north-western Australia. The results of these analyses indicate that E. tetradactylum is fully exploited and that P. macrochir is overexploited. The effectiveness of various management options is evaluated.

The data produced during the first part of this thesis on the diversity, abundance and species compositions of fish faunas in different nearshore habitats along the Canning coast of north-western Australia, and the way these faunas are influenced by season, provides fisheries and environmental managers with information that will enable them to develop management plans for these habitats and their fish species. In addition, the biological data for E. tetradactylum and P. macrochir, and the results of the stock assessments performed on these species, will enable fisheries managers to develop plans for conserving the stocks of these two species in north-western Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polynemidae</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Northwestern</field><field name="subject">Fishes</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090423.112613</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The discourse of conflict</field><field name="creator">Warren Hately</field><field name="description">This dissertation deals with two problems central to contemporary philosophy: the unacknowledged bias of structuralist theory towards linguistic signs and the lack of a coherent theorisation of social conflict. In order to address these conundrums, I reconcile Saussurean and Peircean semiotics and then use Ruthrof&#146;s corporeal pragmatics to break from the verbocentric idea of language as a closed system, showing instead that verbal meanings originate from the body, its senses and its imagination, as informed by the deixis of individual communities. With the transformation of linguistic semiotics into corporeality, Foucault&#146;s notion of discourse and the neglected category of discursive practice are then reworked to show how statements based on nonverbal signs might function discursively.

The culmination of the 1970s Northern Irish prison war in the events of the 1981 hunger strikes offers a study that unites the focus upon nonverbal discourses with the examination of conflict. In exploring the ways in which republican hunger strikers struggled for legitimacy with the prison authorities, I am able to show how previous notions of conflict, especially Lyotard&#146;s diff&#233;rend, are thrown into disrepute by a corporeal perspective recognising the intersemiotic and heterosemiotic character of communication. The availability of diverse semiotic media such as the visual, the haptic, the proximic, etc., offers positions in which conflicts may be regulated without ending in the stalemate that Lyotard describes. The division of semio-discursive phenomena into verbal and nonverbal elements, and the tracing of the effects that these elements have upon ideational and pragmatic planes of action, also reveal a variety of strategies related to conflict that are superposable upon other instances. As a result, the thesis suggests that the role of political violence in politics and the meanings associated with the taking of life can be approached from a new angle.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semantics</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Social conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090423.135734</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jacob Bronowski, the compassionate scientist</field><field name="creator">Peter Sarfaty</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to analyse the life of Bronowski through his work and his discussions of his personal values, so the reader will gain an understanding of the "creative imagination" in science and art, as basic to human specificity.

Jacob Bronowski was born in Lodz, Poland, in 1908, the eldest of three sons of Abram Bronowski and Celia Flatto. During WWI, Russia invaded Poland, the family moved to Germany, and in 1920, Abram who had a linen export business with England moved the family to England. Jacob, who spoke no English, went to the Central Foundation School in London, and on to Cambridge University, where he was a student of Jesus College, graduating with a PhD in Mathematics in 1933.

Being in England gave Bronowski a "light" experience after the "dark" of Poland. England's "civilized minds" excited him and he was fascinated with the English language, which he described as "boney", meaning the language, and the words, could be understood by topological (geometrical) structure. While at Cambridge, in companionship with another mathematician, William Empson, they edited a literary journal Experiment. This gives a lead to the "creative mind" which characterises the human species, a feature which Bronowski develops during the course of this thesis.

During a daylight air raid on London in 1941, Bronowski married Rita Colin (Coblitz) sculptor, and they subsequently had four daughters, Lisa, Judith, Beth and Clare. In English schools, it was usual practice for boys to refer to each other by their surnames, and Bronowski, as a school boy and throughout the remainder of his life was known as Bruno, the Polish diminutive of Bronowski.

When he was at Cambridge, Rita realised, that as a Jew, her husband was not going to be accepted as a Fellow of Jesus College, so he left Cambridge and over the years 1945-1964, when he worked for the Government in England, he developed a reputation as a lecturer, broadcaster, public educator, literary critic, mathematician and extensive writer.

In the thesis, Bronowski's works are analysed including: Science and Human Values, The Poet's Defence, William Blake and the Age of Revolution, The Origins of Knowledge and Imagination, and the BBC TV production, The Ascent of Man, a Knowledge and Imagination, and the BBe TV production, The Ascent of Man, a thirteen part series about the development of animal and human life, from the grunion, a fish on the beaches of La Jolla, San Diego up through modem day studies in quantum physics and DNA structures.

There is a seventh chapter which analyses, The Visionary Eye, a series of essays and lectures put together by his wife Rita in 1978 to show "the bright ribbon of imagination" in her late husband.

I created the thesis title Jacob Bronowski, the Compassionate Scientist to reflect how his values, and activities and ethics reach out to me and touch me. Bronowski's belief that "being a Jew meant to me having a profound sense of intellectual values. It meant being tolerant of the thoughts of other minds, not out of indifference, but of respect, above all out of self respect ..... ethical values of Judaism state we are all responsible for each other." (Bronowski, 1968: On Being a Jew).

These values led Bronowski out of the shock of seeing the destruction of Nagasaki from the atomic bomb, through his thoughts on the Spanish civil war, and the propaganda of Nazism, out of the "ashes" of Auschwitz (part 11 of The Ascent of Man) to become involved in human biology, meeting with Jonas Salk and joining the Salk Institute in 1964.

Writing the thesis has given meaning to my life, about optimism, courage and ethical values, and I do trust it will convey those values to the readers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jacob Bronowski</field><field name="subject">Science</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090424.110536</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic dissection of disease resistance to Phoma medicaginis in Medicago truncatula</field><field name="creator">lars.kamphuis@csiro.au</field><field name="description">Phoma medicaginis is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, commonly found infecting Medicago truncatula and M. sativa in temperate regions of Australia. To identify, characterize and differentiate eight P. medicaginis isolates from Western Australia, morphological phenotypes and five gene regions (actin, &#226;- tubulin, calmodulin, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor 1-&#225;) were examined. Sequence comparisons showed that specimens isolated from M. truncatula in Western Australia formed a group that was consistently different from, but closely allied to, a P. medicaginis var. medicaginis type specimen.

Characterization of three P. medicaginis genotypes showed that all exhibited a narrow host range, causing disease only in M. sativa and M. truncatula among eight commonly cultivated legume species sampled. Infection of 85 M. truncatula accessions showed a continuous distribution in disease phenotypes, with the majority of accessions susceptible. Differences in disease phenotypes suggest that M. truncatula harbours specific and diverse sources of resistance to individual P. medicaginis genotypes.

To characterize the genetic basis of resistance to P. medicaginis two F2 populations derived from crosses between the resistant accession SA27063 and the susceptible accessions SA3054 and A17 were phenotyped for disease symptoms. Highly significant recessive QTLs for resistance to P. medicaginis OMT5 were identified in each mapping population. In SA27063 x A17 a QTL named resistance to the necrotroph Phoma medicaginis one (rnpm1) was identified on the short arm of LG4. In SA27063 x SA3054 a QTL (rnpm2) was identified on the long arm of LG8. Further fine mapping of the areas surrounding the QTLs is underway to identify the genes underlying rnpm1 and rnpm2.

Examination of the recombination frequencies between genetic markers on the long arms of chromosomes 4 and 8 in the SA27063 x A17 cross revealed an apparent genetic linkage between these chromosomes. Subsequent analysis of other crosses showed this unexpected linkage relationship is characteristic for genetic maps derived from A17. Furthermore F1 individuals derived from crosses involving A17 showed 50% pollen viability or less. This semisterility and the unexpected linkage relationships provide good evidence for a reciprocal translocation in A17 between chromosomes four and eight. The implications of the distinctive chromosomal rearrangement in A17 on genetic mapping, genome sequencing and comparative mapping are discussed.

The Mt16kOLI1plus microarray was used to identify transcriptional changes in M. truncatula expressed in defence against P. medicaginis. Three-hundred-and-thirty-four differentially expressed transcripts showed a change of two-fold or more in either the resistant or susceptible interaction, and most of the Phoma-regulated genes could be assigned to functional categories which have been reported to be involved in plant defence responses. RT-qPCR and HPLCUV confirmed involvement of the octadecanoid and phenylpropanoid pathways in response to P. medicaginis infection. Faster induction of lipoxygenase genes and constitutively higher levels of certain phenolic metabolites were observed in resistant plants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicago</field><field name="subject">Disease and pest resistance</field><field name="subject">Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Phoma</field><field name="subject">Pathogenic fungi</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090424.121918</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early onset frontotermporal dementia and alzheimers disease : diagnosis, treatment and care</field><field name="creator">John Rudge</field><field name="description">This research investigated two groups of patients diagnosed with dementia before the age of sixty-five. The patients were diagnosed with Alzheimer&#146;s Disease (AD, n = 25) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD, n = 37). Patients were assessed for approximately 3 years. The study found that FTD is a valid and useful diagnostic category, and can be reliably differentiated from AD. A combination of behavioural, neurological, and neuropsychological assessments were found to be complementary in the early and accurate diagnosis of early-onset dementia, and the differential diagnosis of FTD from AD. FTD patients were found to have relatively preserved visuo-spatial abilities compared to the AD patients. Problems associated with administering neuropsychological tests to early-onset dementia patients were highlighted. FTD patients were found to deteriorate more rapidly than AD patients, and to have significantly increased behavioural disturbances throughout the course of the illness in comparison with the AD patients. Practical guidelines to assist with care and management of early-onset dementia patients were presented. A strengths-based model of care was outlined. Individualised assessments and care plans were recommended for the development and provision of humane services to early-onset dementia patients.

This is mainly due to the limited geometric strength of the GPS satellite constellation, the quality of INS and the system integration technology. This research is focused on pseudolite (PL) augmentation to enhance the geometric strength of the GPS satellite constellation, and the Neural Network (NN) aided Kalman filter (KF) system integration algorithm to improve the geo-referencing system's performance during GPS outages. The main research contributions are summarized as below:  a) Systematic errors introduced by pseudolites have been investigated. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that errors of troposphere delay modelling, differential nonlinearity and pseudolite location are sensitive to pseudolite receiver geometry. Their effect on final positioning solutions can be minimised by selecting optimal pseudolite and receiver locations, which is referred to as geometry design. Optimal geometry design for pseudolite augmented systems has been proposed based on simulation results in airborne surveying scenarios.  b) Nonlinear geometry bias, or nonlinearity, exists in single difference processes when the unit vectors from the reference and user receivers to a satellite or pseudolite are non-parallel. Similar to long baseline differential GPS (DGPS), nonlinearity is a serious issue in pseudolite augmentation. A Projected Single Difference (PSD) method has been introduced to eliminate nonlinear geometry bias. An optimized expression has been derived to calculate the direction of project vectors, and the advantages of applying PSD in pseudolite augmented airborne DGPS have been demonstrated.  c) A new method for pseudolite tropospheric delay modelling has been proposed, which is based on single-differenced GPS tropospheric delay models. The performance of different models has been investigated through simulations and field testing. The advantages and limitations of each method have been analysed. It is determined that the Bouska model performs relatively well in all ranges and elevations if the meteorological parameters in the models can be accurately collected.  d) An adaptive pseudolite tropospheric delay modelling method has been developed to reduce modelling error by estimating meteorological parameters in real-time, using GPS and pseudolite measurements. Test results show that pseudolite tropospheric delay modelling errors can be effectively mitigated by the proposed method.  e) A novel geo-referencing system based on GPS/PL/INS integration has been developed as an alternative to existing GPS/INS systems. With the inclusion of pseudolite signals to enhance availability and geometry strength of GPS signals, the continuity and precision of the GPS/INS system can be significantly improved. Flight trials have been conducted to evaluate the system performance for airborne mapping. The results show that the accuracy and reliability of the geo-referenced solution can be improved with the deployment of one or more pseudolites.  f) Two KF and NN hybrid methods have been proposed to improve geo-referenced results during GPS outages. As the KF prediction diverges without measurement update, the performance of a GPS/INS integrated system degrades rapidly during GPS outages. Neural networks can overcome this limitation of KF. The first method uses NN to map vehicle manoeuvres with KF measurement in a loosely coupled GPS/INS system. In the second method, an NN is trained to map INS measurements with selected KF error states in a tightly coupled GPS/INS system when GPS signals are available. These training results can be used to modify KF time updates. Optimal input/output and NN structure have been investigated. Field tests show that the proposed hybrid methods can dramatically improve geo-referenced solutions during GPS outages.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systems Integration.</field><field name="subject">GPS.</field><field name="subject">INS.</field><field name="subject">Pseudolite.</field><field name="subject">Geo-reference.</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="subject">Inertial navigation systems.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in surveying.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in navigation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40675</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anchor free localization for ad-hoc wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Nawaz, Sarfraz, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wireless sensor networks allow us to instrument our world in novel ways providing detailed insight that had not been possible earlier. Since these networks provide an interface to the physical world, it is necessary for each sensor node to learn its location in the physical space. The availability of location information at individual sensor nodes allows the network to provide higher layer services such as location stamped event reporting, geographic routing, in-network processing etc. A wide range of these sensor network protocols do not require absolute node coordinates and can work with relative node positions. This motivates for the need of anchor free localization algorithms that localize the individual sensor nodes with respect to each other in a local coordinate system. Such algorithms allow the sensor networks to be decoupled from external infrastructure and become truly place and play systems.  The primary contributions of this thesis include two anchor free localization algorithms and one location refinement algorithm for ad-hoc wireless sensor networks. Our distributed anchor free localization algorithms do not require any external infrastructure in the form of landmark or manually initialized anchor nodes. These algorithms use measured inter-node distances among some node pairs and localize the entire network in a local coordinate system up to a global translation, rotation and reflection. The relative or virtual coordinates assigned by these algorithms can be readily used with a range of sensor network services like geographic routing, data aggregation, topology control etc.  Our first localization algorithm is based on a distributed collaborative approach where all of the nodes in the network collaborate with each other to select a set of nodes. These nodes are localized and then used as reference nodes for the remaining sensor nodes. The novelty of this approach is that instead of solving the localization problem for the entire network upfront, first a small well-formed localization problem is solved and then these results are used to solve the localization problem for the remaining nodes in the network.  Our second localization algorithm borrows ideas from the data visualization field and exploits the general undirected graph drawing theory to solve the sensor network localization problem. This algorithm divides the network into a large number of small overlapping clusters and creates local coordinate systems for each of the clusters. These clusters are then merged together in a single coordinate system using a novel distributed algorithm that seeks to minimize the error during this merge process.  Our final contribution is a distributed location refinement algorithm that can be used with any of the range based localization algorithms to refine the sensor node coordinates to conform to the measured inter-node distances. We model this coordinate refinement problem as an unconstrained non-linear optimization problem and then transform this optimization problem into an aggregate computation problem. We propose two different approaches to solve this aggregate computation problem in a distributed manner.  We evaluate our algorithms with detailed simulations using both Matlab and TinyOS simulator TOSSIM. We also validate our simulation results with experimentation carried out on a real network of MIT Cricket motes. We conclude this thesis with lessons learned during this research and discuss some future directions which can be explored to advance the research in sensor network localization.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Location</field><field name="subject">Localization</field><field name="subject">Wireless networks</field><field name="subject">Localization theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41427</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of appropriate instructional design to match the ability of the learner</field><field name="creator">Maxwell, Elizabeth Anne, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Content analyses of research in the literature of gifted education (Coleman, 2006; Rogers, 1999, 2006) has shown a consistent absence of research investigating methodology for instructing gifted students and for the development of expertise using new technologies. In this study, utilising electronic instructional delivery, an investigation was undertaken of the differential effects and appropriateness of matching the prior knowledge of the learner to the instructional method. Underpinned with a theoretical understanding of gifted education and cognitive load theory, a series of three experiments was designed and implemented to determine whether gifted students learn more effectively under guided discovery design than with example based instruction, while not identified as gifted ability students perform significantly better under direct example based instruction than with guided discovery. Data were collected and analysed in three stages. Experiment 1 was conducted in the novel domain of Boolean switching equations. Experiments 2 and 3 used identical test instruments with novel tasks in the semi-familiar domain of geometry. A total of 155 Years 7, 8 and 9 students at three metropolitan secondary schools participated. The study explored whether the presence of schemas, that facilitated greater problem-solving ability in gifted students, would generate clear evidence of instructional efficiency and preference for either mode of instruction. As students advanced from novice state to expert in particular domains of learning, it was anticipated that gifted students would progress from benefiting from worked example instruction to more efficient learning in guided discovery mode. This hypothesis was rejected as the results from each of the experiments did not confirm the hypothesised outcomes. There was no manifested expertise-reversal effect. The absence of any clear delineation of enhanced learning proficiency mode of instruction for gifted students does, however, contribute to the advancement and understanding of cognitive load theory and the complexity of learning strategies necessary for gifted learners.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children education</field><field name="subject">gifted and talented children</field><field name="subject">cognitive load theory</field><field name="subject">technology study and teaching</field><field name="subject">guided discovery instruction</field><field name="subject">worked examples instruction</field><field name="subject">Ability grouping in education</field><field name="subject">Gifted children -- Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40887</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punishment and imprisonment in New South Wales: towards a conceptual analysis of purpose</field><field name="creator">Sotiri, Melinda, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research conducts a conceptual and qualitative investigation into the practices, rationales and functions of imprisonment in NSW. A specific system of imprisonment, in this case the prisons operated by the NSW Department of Corrective services, is explored in order to examine the practices, processes and justifications for incarceration. The various purposes, theories, rhetorics, practices and contradictions of the prison system in NSW and the ways in which the people who are responsible for the administration of this system make sense of its operations and its incoherencies, are central to this analysis.  This research utilises a hybrid methodology involving aspects of content analysis and grounded theory. At the centre of this research are eight interviews with senior NSW Corrective Services staff. This analysis is supplemented by interview with ex-prisoners, and other people familiar with, but not working for Corrective Services. In addition a documentary analysis of both Corrective Services documents, and external literature examining NSW prison is carried out.  The findings of these analyses are then explored with reference to both their internal coherency, as well as their relationship to a range of theoretical frameworks. The thesis connects abstract and philosophical questions of punishment and penalty with the logistics of running the prison system in NSW. This research found a diversity of practices, understandings and justifications of imprisonment which connected to particular cultural, social philosophical and structural trends. These included victimary discourses, the rhetoric of progress, the influence of managerialism, the faith in ???objective??? professionals, the increasing emphasis on empiricism, the conflicts between coercive practices and individual responsibility, the construction of prisoners as dangerous, and an ongoing struggle for purpose. Imprisonment in NSW was found to be characterised by discrepancies between the intentions of its administrators and pragmatics of its practice, conflicts between internal explanations of its purpose, as well as contradictions between internal Corrective Services accounts and external expectations about the roles, functions and practices of imprisonment. Theoretical perspectives explaining why these characterise imprisonment in NSW were developed. These perspective include the ???ought/is??? confusion of penal administrators, the inhumanity of humane containment, the myth of technocratic amorality, and the sedimentation of purpose.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Punishment -- New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Imprisonment -- New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38574</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating sexuality : a personal review of homosexual behaviour, identities and subcultures in social research</field><field name="creator">Prestage, Garrett, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the relationship between identity, behaviour and desire to examine the nature of research among homosexually active men. The hypothesis is that samples of such men necessarily reflect the definitions of sexuality and homosexuality, and their interpretation, by both the researchers themselves and their research subjects, meaning that the research process itself is marked by the subjectivity of the field of sexuality. The relationship between the observer and the observed is intrinsic to research into homosexual subjectivity and the samples obtained, therefore, represent particular kinds of sexual subjects in a particular social and sexual cultural milieu. Research in this field has given pre-eminence to behaviour over identity and desire, and, as such, has usually failed to account for these differences in sexual subjectivities. To investigate this problem, I have reviewed the relevant literature both on subjectivity and on methodological approaches to research among homosexual men, and I have appraised my own ideological and personal relationships with the subject matter. I have examined the nature of the samples of homosexual men I have obtained during my work as a researcher within the Sydney gay community and reanalysed these with regard to the particular problematic I have identified. These investigations and analyses have shown that there are numerous differences within and between the various samples of homosexual men obtained, indicating that methodological frameworks can determine the nature of the samples obtained. These differences in samples also appear to reflect differences in the ways of enacting homosexual desire among the men in the studies. However, they also parallel differences in the definitions and understandings of the target population by the researchers themselves. These differences reflect differences in definition and understanding both of homosexuality and of the population of gay men, but they also represent differing patterns in the ways of being and living ?gay?, differences in sexual subjectivity. ?Gayness? and homosexuality, as concepts in research, are both the subjective basis on which the research endeavour itself is based, as well as its representational outcome.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homosexuality</field><field name="subject">Gay men -- Sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">Sex (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Sexual behavior surveys</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19353</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of incentives, uncertainty and transaction costs on the efficiency of public sector outsourcing contracts</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Paul H., Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the late 1970s, the world has experienced a wave of microeconomic reform that has resulted in the privatisation of many previously State-owned assets, as well as other reforms directed at improving the efficiency of government business enterprises. This dissertation focuses on one important instrument of reform: outsourcing of public-sector service provision. Despite the prevalence of outsourcing, there has been relatively little empirical work analysing the effects of outsourcing at the contract level. This dissertation addresses three important empirical issues related to outsourcing. First, analysis of the magnitude and sources of cost savings associated with outsourcing was undertaken using a present value costing framework. Unlike other studies, this study includes transaction costs and considers how costs change over the life of the contract. The results indicate that savings of 37 per cent were achieved in the first year of contract operation ?savings that were achieved through a combination of reductions in pay and conditions, labour-saving technological change and reductions in inefficiency. Secondly, the dissertation considered why the level of savings achieved fell to 24 per cent following contract variations at the end of year 1. Some evidence indicated that this may have been due to opportunistic behaviour or hold-up: that the contract service provider may have taken advantage of contractual incompleteness and increased its price during the course of contract renegotiations. Although hold-up is an important theme in the literature on contracts, little empirical work has been undertaken in verifying its existence. Thirdly, the impact of contract design on the efficiency of outsourcing arrangements was analysed. It is well known that contract theory predicts a trade-off between incentives and risk. Using the standard principal-agent framework, a simple model is developed to analyse the effects of demand uncertainty on the risk-incentive trade-off. This model is then tested using data from maintenance services contracts at two corporatised water retailers in Melbourne: an environment that is characterised by high levels of both cost and demand uncertainty. Using a general linear regression model, the results obtained indicate that the moral hazard effect dominated the risk premium effect.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Public onctracts--Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Contracting out--Government policy--Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Transaction costs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20506</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taphonomic and palaeoecological investigations of Riversleigh Oligo-miocene fossil sites: mammalian palaeocommunities and their habitats</field><field name="creator">Bassarova, Mina, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The palaeoecology of selected fossil sites from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland, Australia, was studied with the aim of describing the palaeohabitats of the sites through the use of characteristics of mammalian community structure. Taphonomic analyses were carried out to determine whether the study sites represent allochthonous or autochthonous assemblages. Subsequently, ecological attributes of the mammalian fossil assemblages were inferred from functional morphology. Trophic and locomotor behaviours were used to describe the adaptive structure of communities and a method was established for inferring the locomotor behaviour of fossil taxa from morphometrics of their calcanea. Such ecological attributes of the assemblages can be used in reconstructing habitats. This is possible because modern mammalian community structure (as represented by ecological diversity/attribute characteristics) has been found to correlate with habitat structure and thus has predictive value, directly applicable in palaeoecology. Modern mammalian faunas from a variety of habitats around the world were used as possible analogues for the Riversleigh fossil faunas. Multivariate statistical techniques were explored for identifying potential similarities between the community structure of the fossil faunas and that of the modern faunas. Annual rainfall was then estimated for the fossil sites through regression analysis allowing climatic inference from the faunal palaeocommunities. On the basis of similarities in community structure, general habitat or vegetation structure was proposed for the fossil assemblages. The results of the analyses undertaken indicate that Riversleigh early-middle Miocene habitats were densely forested. The late Oligocene Quantum Leap Site local fauna and the late Miocene Encore Site local fauna suggest mixed vegetation, or more open environments. The trend of decreasing annual rainfall through the Miocene and the palaeohabitats of the Miocene sites proposed here fit the general pattern of vegetation and climate change during this period for the Australian continent as a whole.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">paleontology</field><field name="subject">Queensland Riversleigh</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23074</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A review and retrospective study of some major bacterial orofacial infections</field><field name="creator">Collins, Ann</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacterial diseases -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Head -- Infections</field><field name="subject">Mouth -- Infections</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4209</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONTROL OF KEY POLYMER PROPERTIES VIA REVERSIBLE ADDITION-FRAGMENTATION CHAIN TRANSFER IN EMULSION POLYMERIZATION</field><field name="creator">Altarawneh, Ibrahem</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Engineerig</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emulsion polymerization</field><field name="subject">Block copolymers</field><field name="subject">Xanthate</field><field name="subject">Molecular weight</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4984</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The glossary as fictocriticism : a project ; and, New moon through glass : a novel</field><field name="creator">Farrar, Jill M.</field><field name="description">The Glossary is a fictocritical work which accompanies the novel, New Moon Through Glass, written for my doctorate that encorporates fiction, poetry, analytic and critical text, and which &#8216;writes back&#8217; to the novel without the interpretive gesture and in doing so interrogates the art of fiction via a fictocritical critique. The generic glossary (a collection of glosses) encapsulates the &#8216;interpretive gesture&#8217; par excellence &#8212; the hermeneutical exercise that criticism&#8217;s role has widely been thought to be. Its earliest, medieval form as a commentary (or series of commentaries), translation or exegesis in the margins of or between the lines of a text, reiterates the glossary&#8217;s ostensible purpose to explicate rather than create &#8216;meaning&#8217;. As a fictocritical work, The Glossary therefore both interrupts the monolithic architecture of the text through the techniques of the cut and the stitch, and also, by &#8216;reading between the lines&#8217; of the novel, provides alternative readings; a space for other voices, other texts. In the process the project repositions the glossary before the novel (a reversal of the usual order) inciting a series of readings and re-readings which establish a practice of critical fictionalising and the fictionalising of the critical and an incitement to read in this manner. In the performance, The Glossary ventures to open this Pandora&#8217;s Box and in the process reflects on what, as a practitioner, writing is, what reading is, and what is critical practice and what creative. The Glossary is a performance of a distinction put by Bathes as a &#8216;thinking through&#8217; rather than &#8216;a residue of critical thought&#8217; (1985: 284) and therefore demands to be read as a fictocritical  The Glossary was arrived at after much research and experimentation in my fiction writing practice with footnotes, asides and summarizing (&#8216;the story so far&#8217; style) prefaces or segues and above all definitions, a fascination which might be summarised by the distinction that Charlotte Bront&#235; drew between writing that was &#8216;real&#8217; and writing that was &#8216;true&#8217;. Fiction often requires realism in order to ring true, and yet the elements of language that give it force owe nothing to realism &#8212; its power lies in its imagery, its symmetry, its poetry all of which foreground textuality and intertextuality in a manner congruent with the fictocritical project. The Glossary, ostensibly there to confirm and stabilise knowledge, language and reading practices, shows, by fictionalising the critical, the dependent ordering and silences through the art of character in this knowledge architecture. Far from keeping an &#8216;objective&#8217; distance, The Glossary generates a parallel text to the novel in which the voice of the author &#8216;speaks&#8217;, and in doing so has much to say, by its multi-vocal presence, about authorial intentions (and anxieties), slippages, ruptures and textual transparencies, opacities and excess; about the ways in which writing is both knowledge and being, knowing and making. The Glossary grew (rhizomically though not randomly) from textual asides, after thoughts and back stories, parallel and divergent interests, arguments, lyricisms, associations, allusions and theories. Eventually The Glossary became a piece of writing performing what could not &#8216;make it&#8217; into the work of fiction. That a glossary is made up of &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;entries&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533; proved an enlivening form, which generated a different kind of writing practice and a different kind of writing, perhaps not dissimilar to a web log. In making this comparison I am referencing Kerryn Goldsworthy&#8217;s comments that &#8216;blogging&#8217;, as &#8216;dynamic thinking-in-action&#8217;, sets its form apart from traditional writing and &#8216;creates a shift away from the consumer-producer model&#8217; by destabilising the notion of a one-way transaction, &#8216;active writer producer to passive reader-consumer&#8217;. Each entry in The Glossary is a jumping off point for text to grow either from the point-of-view of the writer or reader, and each item simultaneously encourages a non-linear reading with regard to itself out of which possibilities are generated &#8212; as a body of text; the &#8216;self&#8217; to which it constantly refers &#8212; and the novel it appends. The Glossary allows space for &#8216;undisicplined&#8217; writing which does not conform to the teleological narrative of the thriller genre and in doing so, offers a radically democratic opportunity for the reader (who along with the writer also composes the story) to join in the process and the practice and understand how in &#8216;working through&#8217; any text we are subconsciously glossing and deducing as we go. Some entries in The Glossary relate to specifics in the novel. Others to novels which haunt the text or other texts dreamed of, wished for or forgotten. Many of the subjects of The Glossary are familiar terms in literary and critical discourse examined in the process of writing. Still others relate to identity and to doubling, as a fictional device, but also as textual possibility. The counterpoint between the two texts &#8212; glossary and novel &#8212; holds other dialogues and polylogues: the intimate linkage between love and murder or desire and violence; disappearances &#8212; both textual and familial; childhood, memory and, motherhood; voice, reading, writing- (as well as reading-)blocks; the fl&#226;neur; psychoanalysis and dreams; collage; and the house as a metaphor for the body or the text. Certainly The Glossary presents an occasion for writing, an exercise, an exegesis and, where necessary, an excuse: &#8216;Only paper offers the tactile complexities of the origami life, the papier mache existence.

This is evident in the phenomenal growth in the establishment of alliances the world over despite high failure rates. The high failure rate not withstanding, both domestic and international alliances are critically important to firm success (Glaister and Buckley, 1999). Currently, the top 500 global business firms average 60 major strategic alliances each (Dyer et al., 2001). Results also indicate that more than 80% of surveyed top level managers view strategic alliances as a primary growth vehicle and expect alliances to account for 25% of their company&#146;s market value by 2005 (Schifrin, 2001). 

The simultaneous developments that go under the name of globalization make alliances or entente necessary. Entente, the striking of an alliance, is a responsible part of every good strategist&#146;s repertoire (Ohmae, 2001). In a world of imperfect options, they are often the fastest, least risky and most profitable way to go global; and properly managed alliances are among the best mechanisms that companies have found to bring strategy to bear on these challenges. Although the use of alliances reduces entry risks, managing these alliances entails difficulties. Moreover, this entry strategy has some peculiarities of its own, especially when there are significant cultural differences between the partners. Under these circumstances, partner selection and initial steps toward managing the new relationship become critical factors for successful entry. At the partnership creation stage, the balance between the contributions each company will bring to the partnership and the difficulties they will face in managing their relationship need to be considered. As the relationship unfolds, social processes gain importance. The level of inter partner trust or &#147;perceived likelihood of the other not behaving in a self interested manner&#148; (Madhok, 1995, p.120) influences the performance of the partnership (Gill and Butler, 1996).

Whilst research in the West has attempted to focus on such failings, few researchers have attempted to understand the state of alliances in developing country contexts and alliance partner selection. Malaysia is a successful developing economy with a distinct institutional environment. This thesis explores (1) the criteria used by Malaysian firms to select their partner, both task related and partner related criteria; (2) the contributions that Malaysian firms and their foreign counterparts bring to the partnership; and (3) management of the inter partner relationship, including the difficulties encountered, how the relationship management varies with the characteristics of the Malaysian partner, and the resulting effects on the process of trust building. The study&#146;s results suggest that Malaysia&#146;s stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Malaysian firms take a longer term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner&#146;s intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities rather than merely transaction cost concerns. The study also finds that Malaysian firms, when entering into strategic alliances, do not consider every option, that is, they use filters to reduce the potential choice. Thus the range of possible alliance partners is restricted in many ways, some of these being unconsciously employed. Furthermore, it is clear that, while Malaysian firms consider margins, ratios and percentages, relationships have a pre-eminent role in strategic alliances and that relationships are poised between ends and means to ends. It can therefore be surmised that the overall selection process in Malaysia is fundamentally shaped by the manner in which potential alliance partners are initially identified. Case study evidence from a sample of Malaysian firms seems to bear this out. This study therefore contributes to knowledge about the influence of the institutional environment on alliance partner selection decisions for firms domiciled in developing countries. 

The study utilized phenomenology as its research paradigm, along with the case study method. These methods were found to be highly relevant for conducting exploratory research into strategic alliances because of the need to generate holistic data and for such data to be interpreted within context. Finally, Malaysia&#146;s economic performance to date has been impressive and the outlook for continued high growth rates is good. As Malaysia embarks on the next stage of development, the complementarities between the Malaysian firms and foreign economies will provide even greater opportunities for greater economic integration. The managerial implications for business managers are highlighted. Thus, the formation of strategic alliances to achieve or maintain a competitive advantage and enhance the firm&#146;s performance is an important issue warranting further study (Arino, 2001).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090421.115922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of parks : a history of Tasmania's national parks 1885-2005</field><field name="creator">deb.quarmby@supernerd.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the history of Tasmania&#146;s national parks and protected areas from 1885-2005, analysing the interests, and the organisations and individuals representing them, which have influenced outcomes. Significant organisations representing different and sometimes competing interests have been community based groups, chiefly the naturalist and scientific bodies, bushwalking clubs and environmental organisations; tourism associations, industry interests, notably forestry, mining and hydro-electricity, federal, local and state governments and government agencies, notably the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The thesis argues that the establishment and development of Tasmania&#146;s national parks and protected areas have been shaped by the negotiations, accommodations, conflicts and shifting relative power among these competing interests. 

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries consensus of interest among Tasmania&#146;s social and political elite facilitated the declaration of Tasmania&#146;s first scenery reserves and national parks. Conflicts of interest between preserving land in its natural state and industrial development grew apparent from the 1920s however, and Tasmanian governments managed park expansion through politics of compromise in which national parks accommodated industry demands. The environment movement that emerged in the 1960s protested national parks&#146; &#145;residual&#146; status and with federal government support defeated the State government&#146;s plan to build a dam within an area proposed for a Wild Rivers National Park. Following environmentalists&#146; success in over-riding State government processes to expand the State&#146;s national park estate and World Heritage Area in the early 1980s; the State government strengthened its direct control over the National Parks and Wildlife Service and focused its attention on national parks&#146; tourism role. Aspects of tourism in national parks are, however, incompatible with the preservation of environmental and wilderness values, which resulted in further political conflict between government-supported tourism interests and the national parks movement.  

This thesis complements earlier research on Tasmanian national park history by Mosley, Castles, Shackel, Mendel and Cubit by extending analysis of that history to the twenty-first century, examining the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in that history since the agency&#146;s inception in 1971, and addressing both environmental and social perspectives of national park history. It concludes that by the twenty-first century Tasmanian national park policy required a framework of social values associated with national parks in which to situate environmental protection as national parks&#146; primary purpose.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmania</field><field name="subject">National parks and reserves</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090422.140836</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">People in context : critical social dimensions in complex landscape systems</field><field name="creator">angela_wj_05@internode.on.net</field><field name="description">Landscape-based approaches to solving environmental issues have been widely recommended by scientists and policy makers. These issues are found at the interface of social and ecological systems. Understanding the social dimensions of landscape issues has been suggested as part of the solution. This doctoral research integrated theoretical concepts with survey-based numerical taxonomy and qualitative analysis to explore three social dimensions underpinning decision-making at the landscape scale in rural Australia.

These linked social dimensions that provided a research focus were sense of place and accompanying social capital that is embedded within private, social and institutional practice in discourses of the environment. Complex systems theory provided the framework to explore the interactions and relationships between these dimensions and to describe the emergent processes.

The first phase of this research developed theoretically and empirically derived conceptual models for the three dimensions. These models provided a basis for operationalisation for the survey-based numerical taxonomy in the second phase. Data for this analysis was collected through survey questionnaires (124 returned with 60% response rate) from two social catchments (the Katanning Zone in the Blackwood Basin in Western Australia and the Condamine Headwaters in the upper reaches of the Murray Darling Basin in Queensland). The results from the numerical taxonomy provided a focus for semi-structured interviews (24 representative participants) that provided further analysis through qualitative methods in the third phase.

Combining conceptual models with quantitative and qualitative analysis was used to expose three emergent processes that maintain resilience in these landscape systems. The first was formed through the interactive social relationships between communities of place, identity and interest that constitute social catchments. The second emergent process formed at the nexus of local, scientific and Indigenous frameworks of knowledge. The interactive social catchment relationships and three knowledge frameworks dictated the relative weightings of social, ecological and economic values of the triple bottom line, which formed the third emergent process. It is suggested that the interactions of these emergent processes characterised resilience in these systems.

The social dimensions in this thesis provided a focus that suggests that the interactions between community in a social catchment governs the predominance of knowledge form and the accommodation of the values in the triple bottom line. The integration of theoretical, quantitative and qualitative approaches can be couched within a complex systems framework. This contributes to a re-framing of the social relationships in landscapes to identify social catchments as the appropriate focus for interaction in decision-making at the landscape scale.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090424.115859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hearing loss technology and community at the start of the twenty first century</field><field name="creator">sumarcol@ozemail.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis explores ways in which technology is influencing the lives of hard of hearing people at the start of the 21st century.  The thesis develops and is grounded in a distinction between people who referred to as &#145;deaf&#146; and those who are referred to as &#145;hard of hearing.&#146;  It is argued that there is a lack of recognition of the special needs of hard of hearing people in deaf and disability discourses and more generally in everyday communication.  This lack of recognition is analogous to the absence of women from many forms of social analysis until the latter part of the 20th century.  In light of this clearer specification of the people under consideration, attention shifts to a consideration of the various technologies they can access.  The context within which these technologies are used is one in which, unlike many deaf people who form an integrated community that is differentiated and separate from the general society, hard of hearing people have tended to become socially isolated within the hearing community.  This understanding of the potential for social isolation allows the specific significance of generic computer technology for this group to come to the fore.  As a consequence the thesis focuses upon a detailed examination of the place of a hard of hearing online real community in the lives of a number of hard of hearing people.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hearing impaired</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090424.153651</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing reflective practice</field><field name="creator">Cherry, N. L.</field><field name="description">This study explores how reflection upon oneself and one's own behaviour assists people   - and, in particular, managers - to develop. Reflective techniques are examined in the   context of action-learning (Revans, 1980 and Marsick, 1992) and are argued to be a   powerful means of creating self-understanding, which in turn creates opportunities for   self-directed personal change. Reflective techniques are also examined as a means of   developing the personal craft or praxis of those who try to assist the development of managers, and as a technique for use in action research (Lewin, 1946) and the development of collective knowledge. Schon's (1987) concept of the 'reflective practitioner' provided a major theoretical foundation for this work.   The study employed action research and action learning methodologies. The researcher spent six years honing her understanding and application of reflective techniques in assisting the development of managers. She also applied self-reflection to the development of her own praxis over that time. One result of the study has been the enhancement of the practical, reflection-based   techniques used by the writer to facilitate the development of managers - and more importantly, offered to them to facilitate their own continuing development. Hopefully, these techniques will be of value to other practitioners in this field. A second outcome   has been the review and refinement of some of the theoretical constructs used by this writer and other practitioners and theorists which help to describe and explain the phenomenon of reflection-based behavioural change. A third outcome has been the documentation of a case-study in the application of reflective techniques to the   development of personal praxis, tracking the integration of conceptual understanding and technique.      Chapter 1 provides an overview of the rationale, scope, methodology and outcomes of this study. Chapter 2 explores reflection as a technique for research and the development of collective knowledge, and incorporates a review of the relevant literature. Chapters 3 and 5 examine reflection as a tool for learning, drawing on the   literature and tracking the development of the researcher's own understanding. Chapter 4 describes how the researcher learned to use reflective learning techniques when working with others and follows the gradual integration of her understanding with her practice.

The ability to recall much of this accumulated knowledge commonly deteriorates with time, though some forms part of what is referred to as tacit knowledge. In the context of education, students access and interact with a teacher&#8217;s knowledge in order to create their own, and may have their own data, information and knowledge that could be added to teacher&#8217;s knowledge for everyone&#8217;s benefit. The realization that students can contribute to enhancing personal knowledge is an important cornerstone in developing a mentor (teacher, tutor and facilitator) focused knowledge system. The research presented in this thesis discusses an integrated framework that manages an individual&#8217;s personal data, information and knowledge and enables it to be enhanced by others, in the context of a blended teaching and learning environment. Existing related models, structures, systems and current practices are discussed. The core outcomes of this thesis include: &#8226; the virtualMe framework that can be utilized when developing Web based teaching and learning systems; &#8226; the sniplet content model that can be used as the basis for sharing information and knowledge; &#8226; an annotation framework used to manage knowledge acquisition; and &#8226; a multimedia object (MMO) model that: o allows for related media artefacts to be intuitively grouped in a logical collection; o includes a meta-data schema that encompasses other metadata structures, and manages context and referencing; and o includes a model allowing component parts to be reaggregated if they are separated. The virtualMe framework provides the ability to retain context while transferring the content from one person to another and from one place to another. The framework retains the content&#8217;s original context and then allows the receiver to customise the content and metadata so that the content becomes that person&#8217;s knowledge.

A fundamental geometrical analysis has then been carried out on the major cutting edges of the modified drills according to the national and international standards. It has been shown that this new drill design results in a significant increase in the normal rake angle at lips as well as point relieving at the chisel edge region. Geometrical models for the various drill point features have been established which uniquely define the drill point features of the modified drill design.  A comprehensive experimental investigation has been carried out to study the drilling performance of the modified drills, when drilling a high tensile steel, ASSAB 4340, with TiN coated high speed steel drills over a wide range of drilling conditions. Comparing to the drilling performance with conventional twist drills under the corresponding conditions, it has been found that the modified drills can reduce the thrust force by as much as 46.9% with the average of 23.8%; the reduction of drilling torque is also significant at an average of 13.2% and the maximum of 24.9%. Similarly, the new drill design shows great superiorities over the conventional drills in terms of drill-life. In the drill-life tests, a few conventional drills were broken, but all plane rake faced drills performed very well.  In order to estimate the cutting performance in process planning on a mathematical and quantitative basis when drilling with the modified drills, predictive cutting force models have been developed based on the unified-generalized mechanics of cutting approach. The models have been assessed qualitatively and quantitatively and showed good agreements with the experimental thrust, torque and power. Empirical-type force equations have also been developed to provide simple alternatives for practical applications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Twist drills.</field><field name="subject">Drilling.</field><field name="subject">Plane rake faced drills.</field><field name="subject">Drill-life.</field><field name="subject">Drilling force.</field><field name="subject">High tensile steels.</field><field name="subject">Predictive force models.</field><field name="subject">Drilling and boring machinery -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Drilling and boring machinery -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31220</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the process of evolution and impact of internet technologies on firm behaviour and performance using narrative sequence methods</field><field name="creator">Buttriss, Gary John, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research suggests that to model the complex dynamics of the organisational change in a firm evolving as it implements internet technologies requires capturing diverse independent and interdependent processes across multiple temporal and spatial context both within and external to the firm. This presents both an ontological and epistemological challenge as dominant research methods are either atemporal in nature and attribute action to disembodied variables or are simply storytelling. To provide explanatory legitimacy requires going deeper to capture the action of actors 'acting' within multiple levels of context and to pinpoint deeper 'rock-bottom' causal mechanisms that drive the higher order processes that give rise to the 'organisational life' we observe.  To accomplish explanatory legitimacy I develop an analytical method that makes processuality fundamental and allows for the examination and theorising about mechanisms. The first essential element of this method is a framework that guides the researcher in the systematic gathering together of what we already know from the multidisciplinary and eclectic research in e-business, and in the intensive work of gathering empirical evidence. I apply a new methodology I call narrative sequence analysis, that combines process tracing and sequence analyses to make processes intelligible and help illustrate how mechanisms drive these processes. I use this method to develop an explanatory account of the process of e-business development covering three episodes of change within the Commonwealth Bank of Australia from 1995 to 2006. The research finds that the firm evolves over time as it develops new capabilities and identifies and pursues development opportunities by assembling and committing resources to e-business though both technology development and business application. It draws on past experience and gradually learns to develop, integrate and implement technology into existing business operations, discovers new innovative opportunities in which to apply the technology or is drawn into new areas by others who identify opportunities in which to apply the firm's knowledge, resources and technology.  The path to development depends on the firms starting position and the timing of the sequence of events encountered along the way. It is a coevolutionary process where the firm interacts, cooperates, adapts and responds to the actions and interactions of other actors, balanced by the uncertainty of e-business and business operation risk.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational development and change</field><field name="subject">Mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Processes</field><field name="subject">Causal explanation</field><field name="subject">E-business</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43561</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime in steelmaking slag and development of fluoride-free fluxes</field><field name="creator">Haji Amini, Shahriar, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">A rotating disk technique was used to determine the dissolution rate and diffusivity of CaO and MgO in slags. The dissolution rate was deduced from the measured changes in concentration of oxides in slag with respect to reaction time. The experimental set- up was initially tested with dissolution of magnesia in the CaO ??? 55 wt% Al2O3 slag at 1430 ??C and a measured rate of 2.7 ??10 -5 g/cm2.s was obtained. The dissolution rate was increased by slag chemistry and ranged from 6.5??10-5 to 2.1??10-4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rate of CaO was measured in CaO ??? 42 wt% Al2O3 ??? 8% SiO2 based slag. The measured dissolution rates were found to be strongly dependent on the slag chemistry and temperature and ranged from 5.03??10 -5 to 3.3??10 -4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rates were strongly dependent on the rotation speed and results indicate mass transfer in the slag phase to be rate- limiting step. The diffusivity of MgO / CaO was calculated from the dissolution rate and solubility data, using known mass transfer correlations. The diffusivity of MgO in the calcium aluminate slag at 1430 ??C was found to be about 1.1??10-5 cm2/s. Additions of 5 and 10 wt% Fe2O3 increased the diffusivity by a factor ~ 1.5 to 3, respectively. However, with introduction of (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 5 wt%) and (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 10 wt%) in the slag, the diffusivity increased considerably by a factor of about 29 and 11, respectively. The diffusivity of CaO in calcium aluminosilicate was measured to be in the order of 10-6 to 10-5 over a temperature range of 1430 ??? 1600 ??C. CaF2 increased the diffusivity by a factor of 3 to 5 while MnOx and FeOx, ilmenite and TiO 2 increased the diffusivity substantially and SiO2 had an opposite effect. The measured diffusivities are in accord with published data on comparable systems and are discussed with reference to Eyring theory. It was concluded that MnOx, FeOx and ilmenite in the slag increase the dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime, showing comparable results with respect to CaF2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slag</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">flux (metallurgy).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22469</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an enterprise knowledge base (EKB) framework for new product development (NPD) in customer order driven engineering (CODE) environment</field><field name="creator">Sharif, Syed Ahsan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely believed that with the transition from the industrial to information-based economics, organizational knowledge has emerged as the single most critical resource at both macro and micro levels, which promotes the creation, sharing, and leveraging of the organization???s knowledge in current Customer Order Driven Engineering (CODE) environment. Insufficient knowledge management, hence lack of a structured Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) in a CODE environment, whilst involved in New Product Development (NPD) process may result in several problems resulting in creating less successful products. This research establishes an ???Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) framework??? with focus on the Product, Process and Organizational issues related to the NPD process. The framework has three major stages, namely ???Knowledge Acquisition???, ???Knowledge Organizing??? and ???Knowledge Validating???. Various frameworks/methods/models are developed as steps for each of these stages. The framework may increase the effectiveness of product and process development as well as enterprise competitiveness through developing a system architecture to understand, analyse and map organisational, operational activities and business objectives; and increasing the ability of an organisation to establish an integrated partnerships to share efforts on the design, manufacture and delivery of products. In knowledge acquisition stage, a ???Knowledge Capture framework??? and the ???Relationship matrices??? are developed to analyse and link the generic knowledge items of a NPD process in concurrent engineering environment. Among the relationship matrices, Task versus Task (Design Structure Matrix - DSM) matrix is comprehensively explored and decomposed to structure and link several processes at different levels for effective representation of the overall enterprise representation. In knowledge organizing stage, the acquired knowledge (important relations identified in the Task versus Task matrices) is represented in the form of ???Questionnaires???. Best practices gathered from several manufacturing firms in NPD in CODE have also been  used as knowledge resource base for the Questionnaires. For grouping and validation of these Questionnaires, an ???Assessment Model??? is developed, which consists of five performance indicators of the organization namely ???Marketing???, ???Technical???, ???Financial???, ???Resource Management???, and ???Project Management???. Industry applications are carried out in two Australian Manufacturing Companies for the validation of the acquired knowledge. Two tests are carried out; in order to assess the sensitivity of question categories followed by another test to observe whether the model can accurately display the overall performance of the company in the five categories of NPD phases. These two tests have identified possible improvement areas in the NPD process of manufacturing organizations involved in the validation phase. Up to 80% of the findings of the EKB framework and assessment model were found to reflect the actual practices of the organizations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">New products - Management</field><field name="subject">Product management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24260</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation Of The Association Between Toxin-Producing Staphylococcus Biochemical Changes And Jaw Muscle Pain</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Neil Roland</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Temporomandibular joint -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Staphylococcal infections</field><field name="subject">Myalgia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4697</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scouring and Dag in Sheep in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">C.Bath@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Diarrhoea (&#147;scouring&#148;) in sheep increases the risk of faecal soiling of the breech (&#147;dag&#148;) that in turn causes significant production losses for sheep producers and increases susceptibility of sheep to breech blowfly strike. The common causes of scouring in sheep of post-weaning age in Western Australia have not been well described. 

In a written questionnaire sent to sheep producers in the south west of Western Australia, about half of the respondents reported lamb, hogget and ewe flocks with moderate or severe dag. Flocks with moderate or severe dag were reported more commonly in the winter and spring months in all age groups. Young sheep and mated ewes were most susceptible to moderate or severe dag. The utilisation of professional worm control advice and parasite management tools did not reduce the risk of moderate/severe dag.  

A study conducted at an abattoir showed that large strongyle worm egg  counts (WEC) were frequently identified in lamb lines but were much less common in adult lines. The relationship between WEC and scouring was not clear, suggesting that factors other than large strongyle infections were important, particularly in adult sheep. The low WEC and seasonal scouring pattern observed in adult sheep was consistent with the larval hypersensitivity scouring syndrome and/or factors related to green pasture as potential common causes of scouring in adult sheep. This observation was consistent with detailed investigations of flocks with &#147;low WEC scouring&#148; that found larval hypersensitivity scouring syndrome or factors associated with green pasture were the most likely causes of scouring in eight of the nine flocks examined. Large immature worm burdens were common and the scouring sheep had more fourth stage larvae than normal sheep. Treatment with a fully effective drench and an ivermectin controlled-release rumen capsule did not result in a reduction of faecal moisture content between three and seven weeks after treatment. 

The effects of dietary soluble non-starch polysaccharides were studied using  carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as a model. The CMC model was used to demonstrate that significant interactions between diet and strongyle larvae  determined both faecal consistency and strongyle establishment. Sheep fed CMC had softer, looser and wetter faeces, but the factors that determined faecal consistency were complex. Establishment of T. colubriformis was significantly greater in sheep fed CMC suggesting that the environment within the gut may affect establishment of T. colubriformis in the small intestine. The findings suggested that dietary factors may interact with strongyle larvae to determine both worm establishment and severity of scouring. 

The results of the studies described in this thesis suggested that factors related to immature strongyle larvae, diet and the immune response interact to determine the severity of the scouring observed in sheep of post-weaning age in the south west of Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">dags</field><field name="subject">diarrhoea</field><field name="subject">scouring</field><field name="subject">parasites</field><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20070831.155237</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinetics of the dissolution of chalcopyrite in chloride media</field><field name="creator">L.VelasquezYevenes@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">One of the most important outstanding problems with the hydrometallurgy of copper is the low temperature leaching of chalcopyrite. In this thesis, a fundamental study at low temperature was undertaken in order to establish a mechanism, which is consistent with the data obtained in an extensive study of the kinetics of dissolution of several chalcopyrite concentrates. 

It will be demonstrated that enhanced rates of dissolution can be achieved at ambient temperatures by the application of controlled potentials in the range 560-650 mV, depending on the concentration of chloride ions. However, control of the potential by the use of electrochemical or chemical oxidation of iron(II) or copper(I) ions is ineffective unless carried out in the presence of dissolved oxygen. The rates of dissolution are approximately constant for up to 80% dissolution for sized fractions of the concentrates with an activation of energy of about 75 kJ mole-1. Chalcopyrite from different sources appears to dissolve at approximately the same rate which is largely independent of the iron and copper ion concentrations, the acidity and chloride ion concentration but depends in some cases on the presence of additives such as fine pyrite or silver ions.

Based on the results of these leaching experiments and detailed mineralogical analyses of the residues, a mechanism involving non-oxidative dissolution of the mineral coupled to oxidation of the product hydrogen sulfide will be proposed. The latter reaction is shown to occur predominantly by a copper ion &#150; catalyzed reaction with dissolved oxygen. The results of an independent study of the kinetics of this reaction will be presented which will demonstrate that the rates are consistent with those obtained for the dissolution of the mineral. The possible involvement of a covellite-like surface layer on the chalcopyrite under some conditions will also be discussed as it relates to the mechanism. It will also be shown that fine pyrite particles can also act as a catalyst surface for the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. This mechanism is consistent with the mineralogy which confirmed the formation of secondary sulfur which is not associated with chalcopyrite but is associated with fine pyrite if present.

A comparison of this mechanism with that proposed in other more limited studies of the dissolution of chalcopyrite under similar conditions in sulfate solutions has been made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chalcopyrite</field><field name="subject">Dissolution</field><field name="subject">Chloride media</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090430.154851</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"It's stupid being a girl!" The Tomboy character in Selected Children&#146;s Series Fiction</field><field name="creator">ricepot@gmail.com</field><field name="description">The tomboy is a female character that has featured prominently in many popular works of children's literature. Typically, the tomboy is a prepubescent or teenaged girl who is frustrated by the expectations and limitations placed upon her because she is female. She is reluctant to conform to feminine standards of appearance and behaviour.

This thesis examines the representation and evolution of the tomboy character in two distinct categories of children's series fiction, 'books in a series' and 'series books'[1], focusing on narratological elements such as plot, characterisation and series structure, as well as their publishing context, exploring issues of authorial intent, editorial decisions and, in certain cases, the official revision of texts. 'Books in a series' are usually presented as bildungsroman &#150; that is, stories, or in this case, series, of development. In these narratives, time progresses and the characters age; tomboyishness is depicted as a temporary phase which is grown out of when a girl matures, and learns to accept and perform femininity. In contrast, 'series books' are centred on adventure and/or mystery stories, rather than on the process of growing up &#150; the characters' ages are typically frozen, and tomboyishness is a distinguishing character attribute which remains for the course of the series. 

In studying children's literature, it is important to acknowledge that the audience of children's literature includes adults as well as children &#150; it is after all, adults who determine and control the production, distribution and legitimisation of texts for children. Originally, children's literature was written specifically for the religious, moral, behavioural and social instruction of children, rather than for their entertainment. Although appearing less overtly didactic in recent times, the production of children&#146;s literature has continued to be driven by the adult concern for ideological appropriateness, and the desire to responsibly educate its young readers. This concern and desire are fuelled by the underlying and persistent belief that children are like sponges and will absorb whatever they are exposed to[2], including representations of gender difference and gender performance. The ways in which the tomboy character has evolved in the children's series are a direct reflection of the shifts in society&#146;s ideas about gender, the gendered education of children, and the adult conception of what is ideologically appropriate for the children&#146;s text. 

The tomboy character in children's literature has been an important cultural marker of both our evolving and constant values. It is clear that over time gender roles have changed significantly, allowing girls in series fiction to be sleuths, rescuers, warriors and adventurers, but through all of this change, the representation of the tomboy has always reflected adults' conception of what is ideologically appropriate and normal and therefore desirable, in the representation of masculinity and femininity, gender and sexuality in children&#146;s literature &#150; a normality and system of gender based on a steadfast heterosexual hegemony.

The PEF treatments were conducted at field intensities of 25-37 kV cm-1 (up to 50 kV cm-1)and temperature range of 30&#176;C to 75&#186;C. Native milk enzymes selected for the study included alkaline phosphatase, lipase, xanthine oxidase and plasminand  microbiological study included determining Total Plate Count (TPC) and Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae counts in skim milk.        At 30&#186;C PEF treatment at maximum field intensity inactivated AlP by 42% while at 60oC inactivation was higher (67%).  Under these treatment conditions less than1 log reduction in TPC and Pseudomonas count and 2.1 logs reduction in the Enterobacteriaceae count was achieved at 30oC while at 60&#186;C TPC dropped by 2.4 logs and Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae counts were reduced by 5.9 and 2.1 logs, respectively to below the detection limit of 1 CFU mL-1.       Combining PEF treatment with heat increased the inactivation level of all enzymes which showed an increasing trend with increasing field intensity and temperature.  Treatment time (4.8, 9.6, 19.2, 28.8 and 38.4 &#181;s) was controlled by either changing the pulse frequencies (100-400 Hz) or product flow rate (30-240 mL min-1) at a constant field intensity of 31 kV cm-1 and it was found that changing the flow rate was a more effective way of enzyme inactivation than changing the frequency due to longer exposure time of enzymes to heat and field intensity.       The size of casein micelles and fat globules was not affected by PEF treatment while severe heating of milk at 97oC for 10 min decreased both micelle and fat globule sizes marginally. The coagulation time of rennet-induced gels made from PEF-treated (35 to 50 kV cm-1) milks (whole and skim) increased as the treatment intensity increased, but remained shorter than gels made from pasteurised milk.       The PEF treatment of milk at various field intensities and temperatures adversely affected the G&#8242;, G&#8242;&#8242; and firmness of gels, but the effects were less pronounced than in gels made from pasteurised milks.       This study concludes that for successful application in milk processing the PEF treatment needs to be combined with mild heat treatment. This approach could achieve safer milk with less damage to milk functionality. However, the quest for a suitable quality assurance indicator enzyme will need more extensive studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulsed electric field (PEF)</field><field name="subject">nonthermal processing</field><field name="subject">microbial inactivation</field><field name="subject">enzyme inactivation</field><field name="subject">rheological and textural analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090514.141558</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Requirements-Oriented Methodology for Evaluating Ontologies</field><field name="creator">Yu, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Ontologies play key roles in many applications today. Therefore, whether using a newly-specified ontology or an existing ontology for use in its target application, it is important to determine the suitability of an ontology to the application at hand. This need is addressed by carrying out ontology evaluation, which determines qualities of an ontology using methodologies, criteria or measures. However, for addressing the ontology requirements from a given application, it is necessary to determine what the appropriate set of criteria and measures are.      In this thesis, we propose a Requirements-Oriented Methodology for Evaluating Ontologies (ROMEO). ROMEO outlines a methodology for determining appropriate methods for ontology evaluation that incorporates a suite of existing ontology evaluation criteria and measures. ROMEO helps ontology engineers to determine relevant ontology evaluation measures for a given set of ontology requirements by linking these requirements to existing ontology evaluation measures through a set of questions. There are three main parts to ROMEO. First, ontology requirements are elicited from a given application and form the basis for an appropriate evaluation of ontologies. Second, appropriate questions are mapped to each ontology requirement. Third, relevant ontology evaluation measures are mapped to each of those questions.      From the ontology requirements of an application, ROMEO is used to determine appropriate methods for ontology evaluation by mapping applicable questions to the requirements and mapping those questions to appropriate measures. In this thesis, we perform the ROMEO methodology to obtain appropriate ontology evaluation methods for ontology-driven applications through case studies of Lonely Planet and Wikipedia.      Since the mappings determined by ROMEO are dependent on the analysis of the ontology engineer, the validation of these mappings is needed. As such, in addition to proposing the ROMEO methodology, a method for the empirical validation of ROMEO mappings is proposed in this thesis. We report on two empirical validation experiments that are carried out in controlled environments to examine the performance of the ontologies over a set of tasks. These tasks vary and are used to compare the performance of a set of ontologies in the respective experimental environment. The ontologies used vary on a specific ontology quality or measure being examined.      Empirical validation experiments are conducted for two mappings between questions and their associated measures, which are drawn from case studies of Lonely Planet and Wikipedia. These validation experiments focus on mappings between questions and their measures. Furthermore, as these mappings are application-independent, they may be reusable in subsequent applications of the ROMEO methodology. Using a ROMEO mapping from the Lonely Planet case study, we validate a mapping of a coverage question to the F-measure. The validation experiment carried out for this mapping was inconclusive, thus requiring further analysis. Using a ROMEO mapping from the Wikipedia case study, we carry out a separate validation experiment examining a mapping between an intersectedness question and the tangledness measure. The results from this experiment showed the mapping to be valid. For future work, we propose additional validation experiments for mappings that have been identified between questions and measures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology evaluation</field><field name="subject">ontology engineering</field><field name="subject">metrics</field><field name="subject">validation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090514.142724</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The path of least resistance : decorative pattern as an analogue of dis/order in everyday life : an exegesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Allowing decorative pattern to take flight is a theme that has preoccupied my art practice ever since becoming infected by Deleuze and Guattari&#8217;s writing, A Thousand Plateaus:Capitalism and Schizophrenia, while completing a Bachelor of Fine Arts, majoring in Textiles. It is evident as an underlying thread or feeling in my making processes and thinking. According to Deleuze and Guattari (1987), to think new thoughts involves &#8216;a wrenching of concepts away from their usual configurations, outside the systems in which they have a home and outside the structures of recognition that constrain thought to the already known&#8217; (p276). In this project I have found myself continually challenged by the intent and consequences of &#8216;shaking things up&#8217;, as I believe this quote implies. A wrenching of concepts away from their usual configurations has come through drawing a comparison between the conceptual structure of decorative pattern and the orders and structures of everyday life. What has emerged is a synthesis of ideas which create a picture of the dis/order that is evident within decorative pattern and in everyday life. I have come to conclude that decorative pattern is passive aggressive. It occurs to me that I could have described decorative pattern in a more positive tone in terms of passive resistance. But, in my mind, this implies a heroic gesture of superseding dominant orders. In this project I consciously employ the term &#8216;passive aggressive&#8217; as an analogy because it acknowledges human flaw as a pattern that is inherent in everyday life. It alludes to the actuality of a relation to order and subsequent disorder that is not heroic, but rather implies humanness and the everyday struggle. While my challenge has been to present a new way of thinking about decorative pattern, underlying this has been a questioning of the structures that define my practice itself. This is evident in the experimental works that I have produced. It has been an evolutionary process that has played out according to a rhythm of shattering and shoring up. I see the resolution of this exploration coming in two parts. One is as the sum of my experimental works and how these artworks inform each other and are read in relation to the text. The other comes through a final installation of work which employs the system for making that has subsequently evolved, moving according to &#8216;the path of least resistance&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">decorative pattern</field><field name="subject">exegesis</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="subject">installation</field><field name="subject">collage</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410202 Fine arts studies (incl. sculpture and painting)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/853</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What are the outcomes and who benefits from the restructuring of the Australian electricity sector?</field><field name="creator">Chester, Lynne, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The last decade has delivered rapid structural change to the Australian electricity sector. The common conceptualisation of the sector's restructuring has been narrowly based around sector-specific regulatory change and the creation of a national electricity market. This thesis argues that such a focus provides an incomplete and inaccurate explanation of the transformation. Three closely interrelated layers of policies and actions embodying the precepts of neoliberalism, and implemented by the state, have driven the sector's transformation. These policies and actions transcend 'electricity-centric' policies and encompass policies which have become systemic to the Australian public sector as well as a third layer which has transformed the prevailing industrial paradigm across all industry sectors.  The drivers of the electricity sector's restructuring --  and the outcomes and beneficiaries arising --  form the core research focus of this thesis. The research task is addressed by using the analytical framework of the French theory of r??gulation. The analysis reveals that the electricity sector has been Australia's second largest contributor of privatisation proceeds, remains dominated by government ownership and has falling levels of foreign ownership. Higher relative wage levels and union membership are also evident as have been job losses and substantial real price increases for households whereas those for business have generally fallen. The purported 'reform' centrepiece, the national electricity market, was found to be increasingly uncompetitive due to its own regulatory regime and market manipulation by government-owned companies. In addition, the sector exhibits a heightened precariousness: an unprecedented financial vulnerability arising from a strong appetite for debt and derivatives and exacerbated by payments to government owners not by new investment in generation capacity; increasing tensions between the nation-state and local-state concerning the national electricity market and compromises with labour; and an exposure to political and financial risks from the sector's global integration. The clear winners from the sector's restructuring are the owners of capital and the state, particularly the local-state, although the sustainability of this situation is questionable. The analysis also generates a number of propositions about the application of r??gulation theory to sector-based research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power production -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Economic aspects -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Privatization -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40779</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of GPS/Pseudolite/INS for high precision kinematic positioning and navigation</field><field name="creator">Lee, Hung Kyu, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The integrated GPS/INS system has become an indispensable tool for providing precise and continuous position, velocity, and attitude information for many positioning and navigation applications. Although the integrated GPS/INS system provides augmented solutions that make use of the complementary features of each component system, its performance is still limited by the quality of GPS measurements, and the geometric strength of the satellite constellation. To address such a problem this research has focussed on the integration of GPS, Pseudolite and INS technologies. The main research contributions are summarised below: (a)A cost effective GPS/INS integration approach has been developed and tested, consisting of a single-frequency L1 GPS receiver and a tactical-grade strapdown INS. Results of field experiments demonstrate that this approach is capable of delivering position accuracies of the order of a few centimetres under a benign operational environment and provides continuously positioning at sub-decimetre accuracy during GPS signal blockage lasting up to about five seconds. (b) A novel kinematic positioning and navigation system based on GPS/Pseudolite/INS integration has been proposed as an alternative to existing GPS/INS systems. With this integration approach, the continuity, integrity, and precision of the GPS/INS system can be significantly improved as the inclusion of pseudolite signals enhances the GPS signal availability and the geometry strength. (c)The impact of pseudolite location errors in such pseudolite-augmented systems has been investigated. Theoretical and numerical analyses reveal that the error effects on measurement models, and on final positioning solutions, can be minimised by selecting optimal pseudolite location(s). (d)A new ambiguity resolution procedure has been developed for use in the proposed GPS/Pseudolite/INS system. It is designed to rapidly and reliably resolve the single-frequency ambiguities due not only to the aiding by pseudolites and INS, but also by adopting a realistic stochastic model and a statistically rigorous ambiguity validation test. The proposed procedure can indeed improve the performance of the single-frequency ambiguity resolution algorithm in terms of both reliability and time-to-fix-ambiguity. (e)An effective cycle slip detection and identification algorithm has been developed, which is suitable for the integrated GPS/Pseudolite/INS system. Test results indicate that induced cycle slips can be reliably detected and instantaneously identified, even if the slips occur at successive epochs. (f)Flight trials have been conducted to evaluate the overall performance for aircraft approach and landing using the GPS/Pseudolite/INS system. Results from these trials show that an enhancement in the accuracy and reliability of the vehicle navigation solution can be achieved with the employment of one or more pseudolite.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pseudolite</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">INS</field><field name="subject">Integrated Navigation System</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39971</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of resistant starch and probiotics in colon inflammation</field><field name="creator">Amansec, Sarah Gracielle, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An imbalance of the T cell immune response is observed in inflammatory bowel disease. Intestinal microbes have been linked to the disease and the disease process leads to severe mucosal injury and systemic translocation of bacterial products. Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunomodulators reduce these aggressive activities but are associated with potentially serious adverse events. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of administration of prebiotics and probiotics that modulate the gut microflora and modulate the immune response, in ameliorating severity of colitis. The prebiotic, high amylose maize resistant starch was used at two different concentrations. A number of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains were used as probiotics. BALB/c mice were administered the prebiotics and probiotics and intrarectally infused with 2.5 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in 45% ethanol, thereby generating colitis. Mucosal cytokine responses, colonic microbial profiles and disease activity indices were monitored. The 5% concentration of high amylose maize resistant starch delayed progression of TNBS colitis as evidenced by reduced weight loss, lesser tissue damage, abrogation of the expression and synthesis of IFN-?? and upregulation of IL-4 and IL-10. The 30% concentration of high amylose maize resistant starch exacerbated the inflammatory response with an increase in acetic acid, coliforms and endopores in the colonic contents. Three strains of bifidobacteria and 3 strains of lactobacilli were individually screened for their activity against TNBS colitis. Each strain had a distinctive effect on the course of colon inflammation. Lactobacillus fermentum VRI 003 was selected for further study as it provided most protection. The ratio of immunosuppressive cytokines to pro-inflammatory cytokines was restored closer to the normal T cell cytokine levels. It also reduced the incidence of translocation of enteric bacteria into the spleens.  Dosing a minimum daily dose of 6x109 CFU L. fermentum VRI-003 to ulcerative colitis patients in remission and maintained on standard therapy for 6 months prevented the exacerbation of symptoms, including diarrhea and abdominal pain, and improved the patient general well being. It also suppressed production of IFN-?? and sustained IL-10 levels. Moreover, absence of endospores and lower numbers of coliforms were detected in the faeces of UC patients during L. fermentum VRI-003 treatment. In summary, 5% high amylose maize resistant starch and L. fermentum VRI 003 prevented colon inflammation by changing the nature of the T cell immune response and modifying the colonic microflora in the murine model. The clinical evidence supported these findings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel diseases</field><field name="subject">Bacteria - Health aspects</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Starch</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23041</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Olfactory discrimination in the rat</field><field name="creator">Sokolic, Ljiljana</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">olfaction</field><field name="subject">discrimination</field><field name="subject">odour masking,</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="subject">benzodiazepines</field><field name="subject">cannabinoids</field><field name="subject">audition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4986</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foreign Intervention and Warfare in Civil Wars: The effect of exogenous resources on the course and nature  of the Angolan and Afghan conflicts</field><field name="creator">Lockyer, Adam</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (Economics)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil war</field><field name="subject">Intervention</field><field name="subject">Warfare</field><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Counterinsurgency</field><field name="subject">Internal war</field><field name="subject">Guerrilla warfare</field><field name="subject">Irregular warfare</field><field name="subject">Conventional warfare</field><field name="subject">Angola</field><field name="subject">Afghanistan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4987</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seed dormancy in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) : comparative genomics, quantitative trait loci analysis and molecular genetics</field><field name="creator">Bonnardeaux, Yumiko Graciela</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Under prolonged wet and damp conditions, barley grain with low dormancy can germinate precociously, a condition known as preharvest sprouting that causes a number of detrimental effects in grain quality. In particular, preharvest sprouting renders the grain unsuitable for malting. The aim of this study was to take a genomics approach to identify and characterise candidate genes that could be linked to the control of seed dormancy in barley. This thesis developed a bioinformatic strategy that exploited the availability of gene sequences with functional evidence in the model species of Arabidopsis and rice. The bioinformatic strategy integrated phenotypic data (QTL data) and comparative genomics for a targeted approach in identifying candidate genes with a high probability of having a conserved function in cereals. This bioinformatic study identified two candidate genes ERA1 and ABI2 with strong evidence for a role in seed dormancy based on their function in Arabidopsis in abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction and their co-location to seed dormancy QTLs in Arabidopsis, rice and wheat. In order to establish whether the candidate genes mapped to seed dormancy QTLs in barley, QTL analyses were performed on a double haploid population, not previously studied, developed from a cross between Stirling, a major Australian malting cultivar, and Harrington, a major Canadian malting cultivar. This cross was specifically chosen for this study, as elucidation of chromosomal regions associated with seed dormancy in the background of a malting cultivar would make a significant contribution for the malting industry. '...'  Identification of a seed dormancy QTL on the long arm of 3H, in a region syntenic to the wheat chromosome locations of ESTS aligning to the ERA1 and ABI2 genes, laid the foundation for physical and genetic mapping of the candidate genes to investigate whether the genes co-located to the QTL on 3H. Physical mapping of the genes in wheat barley addition lines confirmed their positions on the long arm of 3H. Genetic mapping of the ERA1 gene was performed using a CAPS marker developed in this thesis. The genetic mapping of the ERA1 gene did not place the gene within either of the minor QTLs on 3HL, although segregation distortion may have influenced the map position of this gene. Further investigation is required to resolve the positioning of the ERA1 and ABI2 genes in relation to the 3H seed dormancy QTL. The main outcomes of this study have been 1) identification of candidate genes for further study; 2) identification of QTLs on the long arm of 3H that were previously unknown; 3) demonstration of the potential differences in dormancy that can be achieved through the use of specific gene combinations, highlighting the importance of minor genes and the epistatic interactions that occur between them and; 4) the development of a CAPS marker for the ERA1 gene, which can be used to track the gene in barley breeding programs to observe its association with important agronomic traits. This thesis also pioneered the implementation of several new technologies including multiplex-ready PCR (Hayden et al. 2008) for fluorescence&#150;based SSR genotyping and QTLNetwork (Yang et al. 2008) for statistical analysis of QTLs. Seed dormancy is a complex trait and is likely to involve the interplay of a number of genes that have a role in other developmental and regulatory processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Barley -- Seeds -- Dormancy</field><field name="subject">Gene mapping</field><field name="subject">Plant molecular genetics</field><field name="subject">Quantitative genetics</field><field name="subject">Seeds -- Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0019</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Common subexpression detection in dataflow programs</field><field name="creator">Jones, Philip E.

They are still common in many parts of the country, but also rare and absent in some areas where they were abundant before. Together with tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandia) bellbirds are responsible for avian pollination of several native plants in New Zealand. Habitat fragmentation and geographical constraints prevent bellbirds from re-occupying formerly inhabited areas. After translocations birds often disperse; some just disappear, some are thought to fly back to their source site and probably many die. Supplementary feeding provides energy rich food, which helps to ensure birds are well-nourished until they can discover natural food sources at the release sites. Conspecific song playback as an attractant for many bird species can be used as public information about high habitat value and additionally lure birds to good food sources and nest sites. Artificial feeding stations were set up at 18 locations in Kennedy's Bush, Port Hills, Canterbury, New Zealand. Feeders filled with sugar water were available for five to six consecutive days and during observation hours the effect of song playback was tested. Variation in bird numbers resulting from experimental treatments was recorded using five-minute bird counts prior to treatments and additional counts every minute of observation time. Bellbird numbers varied strongly with habitat types, showing highest numbers for dense and tall bush areas and close to creeks and lowest for open areas besides pasture and in post-flowering flax fields. Bellbird numbers increased when song was broadcast, with the strongest effect in areas where bellbird numbers were moderate or low, but not in areas where bellbirds were absent. Feeding stations were not observed to be used by bellbirds. The strong response in bellbird numbers to conspecific song playback proved the attractiveness of song for bellbirds. Nevertheless, its function as a lure for bellbirds to artificial feeding stations was not shown. This contrasting result indicates that the use of bellbird song as an enticement for bellbirds has to be investigated further.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bellbird</field><field name="subject">Anthornis melanura</field><field name="subject">supplementary feeding</field><field name="subject">sugar water</field><field name="subject">song</field><field name="subject">broadcast</field><field name="subject">intraspecific attraction</field><field name="subject">public information</field><field name="subject">habitat selection</field><field name="subject">Kennedy's Bush</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270707 Sociobiology and behavioural ecology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1061</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand nurse practitioner polemic : a discourse analysis : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Jillian Ann</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research has been to trace the development of the nurse practitioner role in New Zealand. Established in 2001, this advanced nursing practice role was birthed amid controversy as historical forces at play both inside and outside nursing struggled for power to control the future of the profession. Using a discourse analytical approach informed by the work of Michel Foucault, the study foregrounds the discourses that have constructed the nurse practitioner role within the New Zealand social and political context. Discourses, as explained by Foucault, are bodies of knowledge construed to be &#8216;truth&#8217; and connected to power by reason of this assumption, serving to fix norms and making it virtually impossible to think outside them. Discourses of nursing and of medicine have established systems of disciplinary practices that produce nurses and physicians within defined role boundaries, not because of legislation, but because discourse has constructed certain rules. The nurse practitioner role transcends those boundaries and offers the possibility of a new and potentially more liberating identity for nurses and nursing. A plural approach of both textuality and discursivity was used to guide the analysis of texts chosen from published literature and from nine interviews conducted with individuals who have been influential in the unfolding of the nurse practitioner role. Both professionally and industrially and in academic and regulatory terms dating back to the Nurses Registration Act, 1901, the political discourses and disciplinary practices serving to position nurses in the health care sector and to represent nursing are examined. The play of these forces has created an interstice from which the nurse practitioner role in New Zealand could emerge. In combination with a new state regime of primary health care, the notion of an autonomous nursing profession in both practice and regulation has challenged medicine&#8217;s traditional right to surveillance of nursing practice. Through a kind of regulated freedom, the availability of assessment, diagnostic and prescribing practices within a nursing discourse signals a radical shift in how nursing can be represented. The nurse practitioner polemic has revolutionised the nursing subject, and may in turn lead to a qualitatively different health service.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nurse practitioner</field><field name="subject">advanced nursing practice</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">primary health care</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/533</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovative heat exchangers for solar water heaters</field><field name="creator">Soo Too, Yen Chean, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The performance of two innovative collector-loop heat exchangers used in pumped circulation solar water heaters was investigated experimentally and numerically, and TRNSYS simulation models were developed for evaluating long-term performance.  The heat exchangers evaluated are a narrow gap mantle on a vertical tank and a falling film system in a standard gas hot water tank. The falling film system is based on minor changes to a mass produced tank and does not require the addition of a special purpose heat exchanger.  The heat exchangers were assessed for a range of operating conditions to quantify the overall heat exchanger UAhx value and the effect of thermal stratification in the tank. Flow visualisation experiments and CFD modelling were also performed to provide detailed understanding of the operation characteristics of the heat exchangers.  For each heat exchanger, the measured and computed collector loop side heat transfer coefficients were correlated by developing new Nusselt number versus Reynolds and Prandtl number functions. New heat transfer correlations were developed for both types of heat exchanger and have been implemented into full solar water heater simulation models in TRNSYS. Predictions of tank stratification conditions in each heat exchanger were in good agreement with experimental data. Compared to a standard direct circulation system, the annual performance of the mantle system and falling film system are 8% and 18% less respectively. The decrease in system performance is due to the heat exchanger penalty and reduced thermal stratification in the storage tank, however they have the added features of freeze protection and suitability for hard water areas. They are also cheaper to manufacture than convectional heat exchange systems. The annual performance of a falling film solar water heater was shown to be affected by de-stratification if an in-tank electric booster was used. However, improved performance can be achieved if an advanced switching controller is used to modulate the flow rate such that the collector return temperature is always higher than the temperature in the top of the tank.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers.</field><field name="subject">Solar water heaters.</field><field name="subject">Simulation methods.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40668</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of a subordinate first language on second language processing in adult bilinguals</field><field name="creator">Nguyen-Hoan, Minh, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present body of research examined adult bilinguals who acquired a second language (L2) from an early age and who subsequently developed language dominance in that language. The question investigated is whether such "early L2-dominant bilinguals" attain a native level of proficiency in their second language. This possibility was explored by comparing bilinguals who had Cantonese L1 (logographic, morphosyllabic), Vietnamese L1 (alphabetic, morphosyllabic) or some "Other" L1 (alphabetic, non-morphosyllabic) to English monolinguals on various tasks in English (L2). The ability to process spoken stimuli was examined using phoneme deletion, spelling-to-dictation, and auditory comprehension tasks. The results showed that bilinguals from all backgrounds had greater difficulty than monolinguals on tasks that required sublexical skills, with the morphosyllabic groups performing the most poorly. The processing of print was investigated using reading aloud and reading comprehension tasks. In contrast to the auditory tasks, only Cantonese L1 bilinguals displayed any discernable difference from monolinguals on reading. Cantonese L1 bilinguals did, however, outperform monolinguals on orthographic memory tasks, such as the spelling of idiosyncratic L2 words. The findings therefore indicated that L1 linguistic structure influences L2 processing in adulthood, despite the former having become subordinate. In order to elucidate whether transfer effects arise solely from early exposure to L1, or whether L1 maintenance also plays a role, the L1 and L2 proficiency of a separate sample of Cantonese L1 bilinguals was examined. However, no meaningful relationship between L1 and L2 proficiency was found. Finally, a sample of late bilinguals were also tested in order to determine whether the L1-specific effects observed in early bilinguals are simply an attenuated version of those in late bilinguals,. The results revealed that the development of language dominance in L2 does lead to qualitatively different outcomes in L2 for early bilinguals. The findings from the present research are most consistent with the Competition Model (e.g., Hernandez, Li, &amp; MacWhinney, 2005), which espouses the notions of L1 transfer and entrenchment to explain second language acquisition. Overall, the research indicates that native attainment in L2 is not assured for all early L2-dominant bilinguals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early L2-dominant bilinguals</field><field name="subject">Second language processing</field><field name="subject">Language dominance</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer effects</field><field name="subject">Morphosyllabicity</field><field name="subject">Bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Adult</field><field name="subject">Psycholinguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41256</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular epidemiology and detection of norovirus</field><field name="creator">Tu, Elise, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Norovirus (NoV) is a major cause of infectious human viral gastroenteritis.  Detection is important to understanding the epidemiology of NoV and the viral dynamics of NoV infection which is poorly understood.  In 2006, a marked increase in gastroenteritis outbreaks occurred worldwide.   During this period, a total of 231 stool samples were obtained from patients with acute gastroenteritis from Australia and New Zealand.  A total of 186 isolates of NoV were detected and sequenced to determine the genotype and relatedness to known epidemic NoV GII.4 variants.  Two GII.4 variants, 2006a and 2006b, were identified in 61.8% and 11.3%, in these cases, respectively.  Thus, the increase in NoV gastroenteritis in 2006 was linked to the emergence of two novel co-circulating GII.4 variants, 2006a and 2006b.  During an outbreak in an aged-care facility, stool samples were collected from the onset of illness to cessation of viral excretion.  Here, viral shedding peaked in the acute stage of illness and continued for an average of 28.7 days.  The viral decay rate was 0.76 per day.  Prolonged asymptomatic shedding of NoV was detected in the elderly. A quality control for the assessment of molecular based viral assays for NoV and other RNA viruses is necessary to meet current testing requirements.  Available controls only monitor the RNA and DNA amplification steps.  An MS2 bacteriophage BioBallTM with 100 pfu was evaluated and applied as a multi-purpose phage control.  It was assessed as a quality control, in comparison to MS2 phage stock, to validate MS2 phage assays.  Furthermore, MS2 BioBallTM was used as a process control for the molecular detection of RNA viruses.  It validated every performed step, determined if the assay worked and its sensitivity.  Thus, MS2 BioBallTM offered uniformity, stability and reproducibility across molecular based viral detection systems.  Overall, this thesis provided valuable insight into the molecular epidemiology of NoV in the southern hemisphere and nature of NoV infections in the elderly.  The MS2 BioBallTM provides standardisation and quality control of viral RNA assays.  Understanding the genetic diversity and viral dynamics of NoV will be crucial to developing effective intervention and treatment strategies, and ultimately lead to reduced viral gastroenteritis worldwide.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality control</field><field name="subject">Norovirus</field><field name="subject">Molecular epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41562</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical/virtual sites: using creative practice to develop alternative communicative spaces</field><field name="creator">Kaye, Nicola, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis interrogates my and others?? creative praxis using the tools of the Internet, webcam, blogging and digital video, to elucidate possibilities for communication.

I ask whether the Internet can assist in the development of social networks and newest social movements (NSMs) by increasing civic bonds and communities. I posit communicative action, reflexivity and praxis as productive tools for a critical practice.

This thesis studies information flow security properties in state-based systems, dealing in particular with modelling and verification methods for asynchronous systems and synchronous systems with schedulers. The aim of this study is to provide a foundational guide to ensure confidentiality in system design and verification.  The thesis begins with a study of definitions of security properties in asynchronous models. Two classes of security notions are of particular interest. Trace-based properties disallow deductions of high security level secrets from low level observation traces. Bisimulation-based properties express security as a low-level observational equivalence relation on states. In the literature, several distinct schools have developed frameworks for information flow security properties based on different semantic domains. One of the major contributions of the thesis is a systematic study that compares security notions, using semantic mappings between two state-based models and a particular process algebraic model.  An advantage of state-based models is the availability of well-developed verification methods and tools for functional properties in finite state systems. The thesis investigates the application of these methods to the algorithmic verification of the information flow security properties in the asynchronous settings. The complexity bounds for verifying these security properties are given as polynomial time for the bisimulation-based properties and polynomial space complete for the trace-based properties. Two heuristics are presented to benefit the verifications of the properties in practice. Timing channels are one of the major concerns in the computer security community, but are not captured in asynchronous models. In the final part of the thesis, a new system model is defined that deals with timing and scheduling. A group of novel security notions, including both trace-based and bisimulation-based properties, are proposed in this new model. It is further investigated whether these security properties are preserved by refinement of schedulers and scheduler implementations. A case study of a multi- evel secure file server is described, which applies a number of access control rules to enforce a particular bisimulation-based property in the synchronous setting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information flow</field><field name="subject">Formal methods</field><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">Noninterference</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43410</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar for land deformation monitoring</field><field name="creator">Chang, Hsing-Chung, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia is one of the leading mineral resource extraction nations in the world. It is one of the world&#146;s top producers of nickel, zinc, uranium, lithium, coal, gold, iron ore and silver. However, the complexity of the environmental issues and the potentially damaging consequences of mining have attracted public attention and political controversy. Other types of underground natural resource exploitation, such as ground water, gas or oil extractions, also cause severe land deformation on different scales in space and time. The subsidence due to underground mining and underground fluid extractions has the potential to impact on surface and near surface infrastructure; as well as water quality and quantity, that in turn has the potential to impact on threatened flora and fauna, and biodiversity conservation. Subsidence can also impact natural and cultural heritage. To date, most of land deformation monitoring is done using conventional surveying techniques, such as total stations, levelling, GPS, etc. These surveying techniques provide high precision in height at millimetre accuracy, but with the drawbacks of inefficiency and costliness (labour intensive and time consuming) when surveying over a large area. Radar interferometry is an imaging technique for measuring geodetic information of terrain. It exploits phase information of the backscattered radar signals from the ground surface to retrieve the altitude or displacements of the objects. It has been successfully applied in the areas of cartography, geodesy, land cover characterisation, mitigation of natural or man-made hazards, etc. The goal of this dissertation was to develop a system which integrated differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), ground survey data and geographic information systems (GIS) as a whole to provide the land deformation maps for underground mining and water extraction activities. This system aimed to reinforce subsidence assessment processes and avoid or mitigate potential risks to lives, infrastructure and the natural environment. The selection of suitable interferometric pairs is limited to the spatial and temporal separations of the acquired SAR images as well as the characteristics of the site, e.g. slope of terrain, land cover, climate, etc. Interferometric pairs with good coherence were selected for further DInSAR analysis. The coherence analysis of both C- and L-band spaceborne SAR data was studied for sites in the State of New South Wales, Australia. The impact of the quality of the digital elevation models (DEM), used to remove the static topography in 2-pass DInSAR, were also analysed. This dissertation examined the quality of the DEM generated using aerial photogrammetry, InSAR, and airborne laser scanning (ALS) against field survey data. Kinematic and real-time kinematic GPS were introduced here as an efficient surveying method for collecting ground truth data for DEM validation. For mine subsidence monitoring, continuous DInSAR mine subsidence maps were generated using ERS-1/2, Radarsat-1 and JERS-1 data with the assumption of negligible horizontal displacement. One of the significant findings of this study was the results from the ERS-1/2 tandem DInSAR, which showed an immediate mine subsidence of 1cm occurred during a period of 24 hours. It also raised the importance of SAR constellations for disaster mitigation. In order to understand the 3-D displacement vectors of mine deformation, this dissertation also proposed a method using the SAR data acquired at 3 independent incidence angles from both ascending and descending orbits. Another issue of the high phase gradient, induced by the mine subsidence, was also addressed. Phase gradient was clearly overcome by having the L-band ALOS data with an imaging resolution of 10m, which is better than the imaging resolution of 18m of the previous generation of the Japanese L-band SAR satellite, JERS-1. The ground survey data over a similar duration was used for validation. Besides mine subsidence monitoring the land deformation caused by groundwater pumping were also presented. In contrast to mine subsidence, the underground water extraction induced subsidence has the characteristics of a slow rate of change and less predictable location and coverage. Two case studies were presented. One was at the geothermal fields in New Zealand and another was the urban subsidence due to underground water over exploitation in China. Both studies were validated against ground survey data. Finally, SAR intensity analysis for detecting land deformation was demonstrated when DInSAR was not applicable due to strong decorrelation. The region of land surface change, which may be caused by human activities or natural disasters, can be classified. Two cases studies were given. The first study was the surface change detection at an open-cut mine. The second one was the 2004 Asian tsunami damage assessment near Banda Aceh. The results presented in this dissertation showed that the integrated system of DInSAR, GIS and ground surveys has the potential to monitor mine subsidence over a large area. The accuracy of the derived subsidence maps can be further improved by having a shorter revisit cycle and better imaging resolution of the newly launched and planned SAR satellites and constellation missions. The subsidence caused by groundwater pumping can be monitored at an accuracy of millimetre by utilising the technique of persistent scatterer InSAR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Radar interferometry</field><field name="subject">Mine subsidence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42602</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incremental knowledge acquisition for case-based reasoning</field><field name="creator">Khan, Abdus Salam, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is an appealing technique for developing intelligent systems. Besides its psycho- logical plausibility and a substantial body of research during recent years, building a good CBR system remains still a difficult task. The main problems remaining are the development of suitable case retrieval and adaptation mechanisms for CBR. The major issues are how and when to capture the necessary knowledge for both of the above aspects. As a contribution to knowledge this thesis proposes a new approach to address the experienced difficulties. The basic framework of Ripple Down Rules (RDR) is extended to allow the incremental development of a knowledge base for each of the two functions: case retrieval and case adaptation, during the use of the system while solving actual problems. The proposed approach allows an expert-user to provide explanations of why, for a given problem, certain actions should be taken. Incrementally knowledge is acquired from the expert-user in which the expert refines a rule which performs unsatisfactorily for a current given problem. The approach facilitates both, the rule acquisition as well as its validation. As a result the knowledge maintenance task of a knowledge engineer is overcome. This approach is effective with respect to both, the development of highly tailored and complex retrieval and adaptation functions for CBR as well as the provision of an intuitive and feasible approach for the expert. The approach has been implemented in a CBR system named MIKAS (Menu Construction using Incre- mental Knowledge Acquisition Systems) for the design of menus (diets) according to dietary requirements. The experimental evidence indicates the suitability of the approach to address the retrieval and adaptation problems of the menu construction domain. The experimental evidence also indicates that the difficulties of developing retrieval and adaptation functions for CBR can be effectively overcome by the proposed new approach. It is expected that the approach is likely to be useful in other problem solving domains where expert intervention is Required to modify a solution.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Case-based reasoning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge acquisition</field><field name="subject">Expert systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19376</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconfigurable Photonic Crystal Cavities</field><field name="creator">Smith, Cameron</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photonic crystal</field><field name="subject">optofluidics</field><field name="subject">resonator</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4988</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalisation: Case studies of two Australian and United States universities</field><field name="creator">aruddy@indiana.edu</field><field name="description">Higher education has undergone significant change as universities have sought to respond to government reforms in a period of globalisation. One major reform that globalisation has introduced is the reduction in state funding for higher education. Universities have turned to other resources to provide funding and one of these is the recruitment of international students. The focus of this thesis is on contrasting the internationalisation policies of two nations, Australia and the United States, by analysing published policies, statistics and carrying out interviews on two campuses. Two universities, one in Australia and the other in the United States, served as case studies to examine the strategies used to implement these policies. Approximately 100 participants were interviewed, including administrators and faculty members, international and domestic students.

Each university featured internationalisation as a goal in its mission statement. By integrating intercultural and global dimensions into the teaching, research and service functions of a university, internationalisation encompasses a multitude of activities that provide an educational experience. While administrators generally stated that the implementation of strategic plans to achieve international goals had been successful, many faculty members, domestic and international students were of the view that international goals were yet to be realised. These contrasting discourses revealed that each university was falling short of achieving its internationalisation goals. Faculty members and domestic and international students expressed dissatisfaction about cultural insensitivity, lack of adequate services that offered housing and emotional/social support, and language barriers. At the same time, each university was achieving some of its internationalisation goals. In conclusion, strategies are suggested that might improve the implementation of internationalisation at both universities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090416.20912</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pre-fermentation maceration of pinot noir wine</field><field name="creator">Goldsworthy, S. A.</field><field name="description">Two pre-fermentation treatments were investigated in Pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) wines. The effects of cold maceration and carbonic maceration on the wines' composition, colour parameters and sensory properties were examined. Cold maceration is a winemaking technique used to increase non-alcoholic extraction in Pinot noir winemaking prior to fermentation. It involves holding crushed grapes with approximately 100-150 mg l&#8315;&#185; SO&#8322; at low temperatures and is thought to increase the colour, aroma and flavour of the resulting wines. Carbonic maceration uses whole bunches that have undergone anaerobic metabolism to produce characteristically fruity and spicy wines. Pre-fermentation cold maceration produces wines that are higher in titratable acidity and monomeric anthocyanin content, but lower in colour density, hue and polymeric pigments. Reducing the maceration temperature below 10&#176;C has little effect. Carbonic maceration produces wines that are lower in titratable acidity, monomeric anthocyanin content, and colour density but are higher in colour hue and amount of polymeric pigments. Quantitative descriptive analysis was used to define the effects of these pre-fermentation maceration treatments on the sensory characteristics of the resulting wine. Trained panel members found that there were no discernable sensory differences in the compositional parameters despite measurable chemical differences. Investigation into the aroma and flavour characteristics of the wines found that carbonic maceration produces wines that were lower in berry aroma and higher in acetate or ester-type aromas than the control wines. These wines were considered to have specific raspberry, floral, sugar, cherry and chemical aromas. This chemical note was also observed in the flavour of the carbonic maceration wines. The temperature of the cold maceration process has no major effect on the aroma and flavour of the resulting wines. However, the 10&#176;C maceration was higher in woody/tobacco aroma than the 4&#176;C maceration, and the 10&#176;C treatment was also higher in bitter flavour than all the other treatments. Cold maceration wines were found to have specific mixed berry, dried fruit and sweet-oxidised aroma characters, together with a blackberry flavour note.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinot noir</field><field name="subject">wine</field><field name="subject">carbonic maceration</field><field name="subject">cold maceration</field><field name="subject">acidity</field><field name="subject">anthocyanin</field><field name="subject">colour</field><field name="subject">sensory</field><field name="subject">quantitative decriptive analysis</field><field name="subject">aroma</field><field name="subject">flavour</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300305 Oenology and viticulture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1058</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential of Lupinus angustifolius cv. Uniharvest, in Canterbury, as a summer greenfeed for lambs</field><field name="creator">Burtt, Elizabeth S.</field><field name="description">Two trials using Lupinus angustifolius cv. Uniharvest were conducted in the summer of 1978-1979 at Lincoln College, Canterbury. From the first trial, designed to measure dry matter accumulation and changing nutritive value of lupins with time, a maximum dry matter yield of just under 990 kg ha&#8315;&#185; was obtained 150 days after sowing. Peak digestibility was 65.0 per cent and was recorded at 125 days after sowing. Protein concentration was highest in the young plant (28.75 per cent at 45 days after sowing) and declined after this, but highest total nitrogen yield coincided with peak dry matter accumulation. In the second trial, lupins at 60 and 100 plants m&#8315;&#178; were grazed with weaned lambs at each of four successive stages of the plants' growth - pre-flower, primary flower, secondary flower and green pod (post-flower). Highest dry matter accumulation,at just under 1 000 g m&#8315;&#178;, occurred at the green pod stage, and peak protein concentration of 23.7 per cent at the pre-flower stage (lower density). Digestibility was highest at the pre-flower stage (higher density) and the metabolizable energy concentration was also highest in the pre-flower high density plots. Regrowth of lupins following grazing occurred in plots which had been grazed at the pre- and primary flower stage. Maximum total dry matter accumulation from the first grazing combined with the regrowth was 1 350 g m&#8315;&#178;. Digestibility, protein and metabolizable energy concentration of the regrowth was at acceptable levels for animal growth. From the results obtained, and those of other workers, both in New Zealand and overseas, it is suggested that lupins may have considerable potential as a high quality summer forage crop for grazing of young lambs.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lupinus angustifolius cv.

The new social phenomenon, retraining in the sense of education for occupational change, is examined in this study. Alongside the three traditionally recognised groups of adult learners: those learning for leisure; second chance learners who have been previously educationally disadvantaged; and upskillers who seek to enhance their existing credentials through further tertiary education; is a fourth; the reskillers, those who are seeking education for occupational change. Women are shown to be pioneers in leading social change in this area of retraining. The key questions investigated in this thesis concern the existence of this new phenomenon in New Zealand; whether it is national or worldwide; and whether its origins are local or international. Whether there are distinctive characteristics to the manifestation of this phenomenon in New Zealand is investigated by examining current policy and practice. Additional questions concern whether there are feature of New Zealand employment or education which make upskilling and reskilling more or less likely in this country; the significance of women being the first to take up education for occupational change and what can be learnt from comparison with other countries specifically the Netherlands and England. Education takes place within a set of intersecting socio-political contexts. In the modern world these are simultaneously international, national, local and institutional. They impact on participants in a course of study yet are not often manifest to the individual. 'Learning for life&#8217; is a significant area of both international and national socio-political concern, manifesting itself in a significant set of public discourses and in social phenomena which, as in this case of education for occupational change, are little researched or understood. The historical evolution of public policy relating to adult learners, internationally, and in New Zealand, is documented, with a particular focus on the period from the 1960s onwards. The major theoretical and ideological constructs are outlined and critiqued particularly with reference to public policy in New Zealand. Analysis shows an inexorable shift over time away from knowledge and skills attained through praxis, to knowledge and skills attained through formal institutionalised learning. At the same time as this change was taking place, participation rates in first secondary, and then tertiary, education rose. Concurrently more and more women entered tertiary education in order to make their way into an increasingly credentialised workforce. It is suggested that, credentials are used for screening purposes in addition to providing individuals with knowledge and skills needed for the occupations they enter. Case studies are used to illustrate and document these changes. Policies relating to learning for life are examined with reference to three different countries: New Zealand, England and the Netherlands. Provision of tertiary education for adults is investigated, and then illustrated through the coverage provided by institutions in three cities, Christchurch, Leicester and Utrecht. These studies show that different countries are subject to international geo-political and ideological forces but respond to them in locally and historically determined ways. The case study/qualitative analysis of the Christchurch Polytechnic&#8217;s Next Step Centre for Women and the New Outlook for Women courses illustrates the ways in which the twists and turns of public policy in New Zealand over thirty years have affected women wishing to seek education for occupational change. A quantitative study of mature students and their motivations for returning to study at the Christchurch Polytechnic allows for the impact of public policy and institutional provision on a group of mature individuals to be assessed. The study concludes that education for occupational change appears to be more advanced in New Zealand than in the European countries chosen for comparison. This may result more from individual initiative and the conditions which promote this, than from state policy direction or institutional provision. Policy consequences are proposed on the basis of these findings.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">occupational change</field><field name="subject">retraining</field><field name="subject">reskilling</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">mature students</field><field name="subject">state policy</field><field name="subject">educational institution</field><field name="subject">provision</field><field name="subject">credential</field><field name="subject">tertiary education</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1068</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do they understand?

Research into novice programming has struggled to identify the critical aspects that would provide a consistently successful approach to teaching introductory object-oriented programming. Starting from the premise that the conceptions of a task determine the type of output from the task, assisting novice programmers to become aware of what the required output should be, may lay a foundation for improving learning. This study adopted a phenomenographic approach. Thirty one practitioners were interviewed about the ways in which they experience object-oriented programming and categories of description and critical aspects were identified. These critical aspects were then used to examine the spaces of learning provided in twenty introductory textbooks. The study uncovered critical aspects that related to the way that practitioners expressed their understanding of an object-oriented program and the influences on their approach to designing programs. The study of the textbooks revealed a large variability in the cover of these critical aspects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">novice programmers</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280301 Programming techniques</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/854</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between osteoporosis knowledge, beliefs and dietary calcium intake among South Asian women in Auckland : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tsai, Midi</field><field name="description">Osteoporosis is a serious public health issue, which is growing in significance because of our aging population. It is estimated that one in three New Zealand women over the age of 50 years will suffer from an osteoporotic-related fracture. The risk of osteoporosis among South Asian women living in New Zealand is unknown. However, this is an important and growing population group. The purpose of this study was to determine osteoporosis knowledge, health beliefs and dietary calcium intake in a sample of South Asian women living in Auckland, New Zealand. Relationships between these variables and the predictors of dietary calcium intake were examined. A sample of 102 South Asian women (mean age of 41.6 years) completed an online questionnaire to assess osteoporosis knowledge and health beliefs using the validated Osteoporosis Knowledge Test (OKT) and Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale (OHBS), respectively. A four day food diary was used to assess dietary calcium and energy intake. In general, these South Asian women were lacking in osteoporosis knowledge, they did not perceive themselves to be susceptible to osteoporosis and did not consider osteoporosis to be a serious disease. They perceived many benefits of consuming a high calcium diet for the prevention of osteoporosis and did not identify many barriers to dietary calcium intake. In addition, these South Asian women were highly health motivated. Perceived barriers to dietary calcium intake (R=-0.32; P&lt;0.01) and health motivation (R=0.30; P&lt;0.01) were significantly correlated to dietary calcium intake. Health motivation, perceived barriers to dietary calcium intake and the use of a dietary supplement were significant predictors of dietary calcium intake and together explained 27% of the variance. These findings suggest that osteoporosis prevention interventions may need to increase awareness, overcome perceived barriers to dietary calcium intake as well as maintain health motivation among these South Asian women to achieve sufficient dietary calcium intake.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoporosis Knowledge Test</field><field name="subject">Osteoporosis Health Belief Scale</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/855</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role and impact of services sector on economic growth : an econometric investigation of tourism and air services in Fiji (1968-2006) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Management in Economics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Qasenivalu, Mosese Tavaga</field><field name="description">Empirical studies have established that tourism is a major determinant of economic growth and that international air services have a beneficial effect on the growth and development of an economy. It has also been argued that trade and public enterprise reforms in the service sectors, undertaken to a greater extent in high income countries, have had a positive impact on the sectors performances. This study analyses several hypotheses relating to Fiji&#8217;s tourism and air transport service industries. First the study examines the contribution of tourism exports to economic growth in the case of Fiji. Second, the study analyses whether the tourism reform adopted by Fiji in 1999 under the World Trade Organization&#8217;s General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has impacted on total tourism export performance. Third, the aviation-service growth nexus is investigated. Lastly, the effect of the aviation public enterprise reform activities on the export performance of air services is evaluated. Using time series annual data from 1968 to 2006, the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag. methodology has been utilized to estimate the contribution of each service sector to Fiji&#8217;s total service output. The results show that the tourism is a major determinant of growth in Fiji and that the aviation service-growth hypothesis is also valid for Fiji. The empirical results show that both the trade reforms in tourism and the pro-competitive measures undertaken in the airline industry, amongst other determinants, have not significantly created an impact on the respective export performance of tourism and air services. These findings provide key policy implications in the light of capitalizing on services exports as a major source of growth, particularly in developing island countries such as Fiji and the need to facilitate the strengthening of the market to boost the export performance of tourism and air services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism export</field><field name="subject">tourism reform</field><field name="subject">aviation public enterprise</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/856</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of digital instrumentation for bond rupture detection : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van der Werff, Matthew John</field><field name="description">In the medical world the precise identification of a disease can take longer than it is safe to wait to start treatment so there is a need for faster and more precise biosensors. Bond Rupture is a new sensor technique that maybe able to improve disease detection. It does this by inducing bonds to rupture from the surface, and also measuring the point at which this rupture occurs this enables the forces to be measured on the surface. Specifically, this project has focused on the application of Bond Rupture to detecting antigens when bound to a surface using their specific antibodies, and the idea that the rupture force of these antigens can also be measured. The sensor that this project is based around is the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM), which oscillates horizontally when a voltage is applied, and can also be used to measure mass change on its surface via change in resonant frequency. The aim of this project was to investigate possible Bond Rupture detection methods and techniques and has involved the development of a high speed digital electronics system, for the purposes of inducing and detecting Bond Rupture. This has involved the development of a FPGA based high speed transceiver board which is controlled by a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), as well as the development of various graphical user interfaces for end user interaction. Bond rupture testing was carried out by rupturing beads from the surface of a QCM in an experiment taking as little as 20 seconds. The Bond Rupture effect has been observed via the high accuracy measurement of the frequency change while inducing Bond Rupture on the sensor, proving that the Bond Rupture effect indeed exists.

To that end, this dissertation examines the benefits and trade-offs involved in applying admission control to a networked computer system at the level of the network interface hardware.  Admission control has traditionally been applied in software, after significant resources have already been expended on processing a request. This design decision leads to systems whose algorithmic cost is a function of the load applied to the system, rather than the load admitted to the system.  By performing admission control at the network interface, it is possible to develop systems whose algorithmic cost is a function of load admitted to the system, rather than load applied to the system. Such systems are able to deal with excessive applied loads without exhibiting performance degradation.  This dissertation first examines existing admission control approaches, focussing on the cost of admission control within those systems. It then goes on to develop a model of system behaviour under overload, and the impact of admission control on that behaviour. A new class of admission control mechanisms which are able to perform load rejection using the network interface hardware are then described, along with a prototype implementation using commodity hardware.  A prototype implementation in the FreeBSD operating system is evaluated for a variety of network protocols and performance is compared to the standard FreeBSD implementation.

Phylogenetic analyses of the dataset showed that the genes of interest underwent frequent recombination, suggesting a low level of clonality within subspecies I of S. enterica. To establish the evolutionary relationships within serovar Typhi, genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) was explored as a marker for both typing purposes and phylogenetic analysis. Thirty eight SNPs were typed in 73 global Typhi isolates, including 18 isolates expressing the special flagellar antigen z66, using restriction enzyme digestion method. The isolates were differentiated into 23 SNP profiles and grouped into four distinct clusters. The z66 isolates were divided into four SNP profiles and were all grouped into one cluster, suggesting a single origin. An alternative SNP typing method using the hairpin real time PCR assay was investigated to type four additional SNPs, termed as biallelic polymorphisms (BiP). These BiPs were found to classify 481 global Typhi isolates into five major clusters (Roumagnac et al., 2006). Typing four BiPs resulted in the identification of four additional SNP profiles. We proposed nine SNPs were required to type Typhi isolates into 13 subclusters for global epidemiology. An enzymatic-based method using CelI nuclease was evaluated to discover more SNPs from other Typhi genomes. The efficiency of the CelI was shown to be unsatisfactory and we were unable to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Nine Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) were typed in the 73 Typhi isolates using fluorescent-labelled universal primers, and analysed on an automated DNA sequencer. Five isolates were unable to give PCR products in one or more VNTR loci. Nine VNTRs could differentiate 68 Typhi isolates into 65 MLVA profiles, suggesting a higher discriminating power than SNP typing. SNPs were shown to be a more appropriate marker for phylogenetic tracing for Typhi while VNTRs were highly discriminating but could not be used to establish the evolutionary relationships of diverse Typhi isolates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SNP</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Typhi</field><field name="subject">VNTR</field><field name="subject">Molecular typing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43115</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of RasGRP1 and 4 in the pathogenesis of human diseases</field><field name="creator">Qi, Miao, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mast cells are known to play an important role in allergic events and in other inflammatory reactions through varied intracellular signaling transduction proteins. RasGRP4 is a mast cell-restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol ester receptor. Interleukin (IL) -13, a critical cytokine for allergic inflammation, exerts its effects through a complex receptor system including IL-4R&#945;, IL-13R&#945;1 and IL-13R&#945;2. IL-13R&#945;2 has been reported to be a decoy receptor for IL-13. My experiments indicate that the mast cell specific RasGRP4 protein regulates the level of IL 13R&#945;2 and controls IL-13/ IL 13R&#945;1-mediated intracellar signaling events in mast cells. Phosphorylation of STAT6 plays an important role in airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma. The development of therapeutics that can regulate RasGRP4 could be used to modulate the IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT-6 that may be used as therapy in patients with asthma. SLE is a complex, heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high levels of autoantibodies. Dysregulation of RasGRP1, a Ras active gene, in mice resulted in a SLE-like disorder. Yasuda and coworkers demonstrated that a defective isoform of RasGRP1 (&#916;11) was present in a subset of patients with SLE. My experiments indicate that RasGRP1 upregulates the expression of IL2RG in T cells. In contrast the &#916;11 RasGRP1 isoform expressed in a subset of SLE patients leads to defective expression of IL2RG. The IL2RG chain is a common chain which forms part of a number of different receptors eg. IL-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 21. IL-2 as well as IL-21, which shares sequence homology with IL-2, has been reported to be involved in the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In SLE patients, CD4 + CD25+ Tregs, which play an essential role in controlling immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and preventing autoimmunity, are significantly decreased when compared with healthy controls. The accumulative evidence suggests that the defective isoform of RasGRP1 (&#916;11) downregulates expression of IL2RG in SLE patients?? T cells and this could effect the generation of CD4 + CD25+ Tregs. This may be another immunological mechanism in loss of tolerance observed in patient with SLE.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RasGRP4</field><field name="subject">Mast cell</field><field name="subject">RasGRP1</field><field name="subject">IL-13R&#945;2</field><field name="subject">IL2RG</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">SLE</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43521</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qubit control-pulse circuits in SOS-CMOS technology for a Si:P quantum computer</field><field name="creator">Ekanayake, Sobhath Ramesh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microelectronics has shaped the world beyond what was thought possible at the time of its advent. One area of current research in this field is on the solid-state Si:P-based quantum computer (QC). In this machine, each qubit requires an individually addressed fast control-pulse for non-adiabatic drive and measure operations. Additionally, it is increasingly becoming important to be able to interface nanoelectronics with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In this work, I have designed and demonstrated full-custom mixed-mode and full-digital fast control-pulse generators fabricated in a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS commercial foundry process ?? a radio-frequency (RF) CMOS technology. These circuits are, fundamentally, fast monostable multivibrators.  Initially, after the design specifications were decided upon, I characterized NFET and PFET devices and a n+-diffusion resistor from 500 nm and 250 nm commercial SOS-CMOS processes. Measuring their conductance curves at 300 300 K, 4.2 2 K, and sub-K (30 30 mK base to 1000 1000 mK) showed that they function with desirable behaviour although exhibiting some deviations from their 300 300 K characteristics.  The mixed-mode first generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing that it produced dwell-time adjustable pulses with 100 100 ps rise-times at 300  K, 4.2 2 K, and sub-K with a power dissipation of 12 12 uW at 100 100 MHz. The full-digital second generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing accurately adjustable dwell-times settable via a control-word streamed synchronously to a shift-register. The design was based on a ripple-counter with provisions for internal or external clocking.  This research has demonstrated that SOS-CMOS technology is highly feasible for the fabrication of control microelectronics for a Si:P-based QC.

One of the major models used to study mucosal mast cells is the RBL-2H3 mast cell line. While there has been considerable research on the initial signalling events following IgE receptor (Fc??RI) cross-linking, the movement of granules to sites of exocytosis is poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms that control granule movement to and fusion with the plasma membrane could provide novel targets for improved asthma and allergy therapeutics. To this end, an isolated intact population of granules from the RBL-2H3 mast cell provides a powerful research tool and as such the primary aim of this work was to isolate intact granules from the RBL-2H3 mast cell. Using iso-osmotic Percoll gradients we have isolated an intact granule population from RBL-2H3 mast cells. This granule population contained three granule markers: ??- hexosaminidase, serotonin and chymase. Triton X-100 pre-lysis resulted in loss of granule markers from this main peak, indicating that the isolated granules are in fact intact. Further analysis of the granule population showed that it is free from bulk contamination with other organelles and plasma membrane. The granules were estimated to have a density of 1.055 ??? 1.092g/mL, significantly less dense than that of rat peritoneal mast cell granules (1.2g/mL; [1]). Using an intact versus lysed approach, granule-associated proteins and phosphoproteins, from unactivated RBL-2H3 cells, were determined. Nine unknown granule-associated proteins were found using silver staining of gradient fractions separated on a SDSPAGE gel. In addition, four unknown serine or threonine granule-associated phosphoproteins were found. Molecular weight comparison suggested overlap in some of the unknown proteins and phosphoproteins. Probing for protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms confirmed previous results suggesting that a small population of PKC?? localised to the granules [2], and extended these results to include a population of PKC??I. The serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 does not appear to be granule associated. However, there was a small loss of PP2A from the granules (upon lysis), suggesting that perhaps a subpopulation of PP2A is granule-associated. The main granule peak represents a secretion competent population as Fc??RI-mediated activation of the cells resulted in a significant loss of granule markers from this peak. At the peak rate of antigen-induced secretion a number of changes occur in the phosphorylation of granule-associated phosphoproteins. In addition to an increase in the phosphorylation of three of the phosphoproteins seen in resting mast cell granules, eight new proteins were seen. Whether these proteins are granule-associated is currently unknown. PKC?? was found to translocate away from the granules at the peak rate of secretion, perhaps representing an important control mechanism in granule exocytosis. None of the tested PKC isoforms were found to translocate to the granules, providing little clue as to the identity of the kinase that may be involved in these phosphorylation events. However, as PKC??I is granule-associated and does not translocate off the granules, it would suggest that this kinase might be important for some of the observed phosphorylations. Overall the studies in this thesis show for the first time a rapid gradient-based method for the isolation of intact granules from unactivated and activated RBL-2H3 mast cells. These granules were used to determine granule-associated proteins and phosphoproteins, as well as to investigate changes that occur during the secretory process. In addition, the results show that a number of proteins have increased serine/threonine phosphorylation at the peak rate of antigen-stimulated secretion. This implies that phosphorylation is likely to play a role in the control of granule exocytosis. The identity of these proteins deserves further investigation. Thus, isolated intact RBL- 2H3 mast cell granules provide a powerful research tool to further investigate the mechanism and control of granule exocytosis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mast cells</field><field name="subject">phosphorylation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23445</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the organisation of information in websites: from hypermedia design to systemic functional hypermedia discourse analysis</field><field name="creator">Djonov, Emilia Nikolaeva, School of English &amp; School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">To date, hypertext and hypermedia research has principally studied the influence of separate features of hypermedia texts on information retrieval. By contrast, this thesis explores the meanings of hypermedia texts and the effects of these meanings on free website exploration. In particular, the study focuses on those meanings which can reveal how information is organised in websites and on the construal of such meanings through the interplay of hyperlinks, visual, verbal, audio and kinetic resources in generically hybrid hypermedia texts. This focus is motivated by research showing that understanding how information is organised in hypermedia texts is crucial for users' successful orientation within them. To achieve its aim, this research studies six websites for children and the navigation paths of fourteen children through one of them, and draws on interviews with the websites' producers and the children. The thesis connects the professional field of hypermedia design with systemic functional theory and systemic functional multimodal discourse analysis (SF MDA). As a result, it offers two tools for hypermedia discourse analysis, which are based on and illustrated through the analyses of five of the websites. The first is the system of HYPERTEXTUAL DISTANCE. Designed to analyse the potential of hyperlinks to reveal, obscure or transcend the textual organisation of a website, this system is built by reconceptualising from a SF MDA perspective a central principle for organising information in websites - website hierarchy. The second tool is the framework for analysing logicosemantic relations in hypermedia. Its categories describe the ideational relations that hold together information presented on the same webpage or on different webpages, which may or may not be hyperlinked with each other. Through the analyses of the sixth website and the navigation paths through it, the thesis exemplifies how both tools, independently and together, can be employed to explore the interdependence of website design and navigation. The discussion of selected results from these analyses, supported by the views of the research participants, identifies ways in which the tools proposed in this thesis can be applied in hypermedia design, evaluation and literacy education and complemented with other tools for hypermedia discourse analysis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">web sites</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23915</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restoration strategies and algorithms for survivable networks</field><field name="creator">Lau, Cheuk Wan William, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes new algorithms for restoration strategies that provision bandwidth guaranteed recovery for unicast and multicast connections. The primary focus is on online restoration strategies that sequentially do pre-planning of resource for each request using the current network resource state. Online restoration strategies do not require prior knowledge of all the requests like that of offline restoration strategies. Therefore, online restoration strategies are more suitable for on-demand and dynamic traffic engineering control. The proposed new algorithms are compared to known algorithms from literature. Most literature evaluates the performance of the algorithms with two metrics only: total bandwidth requirement and the number of requests accepted in the network. This thesis evaluates the algorithms in one additional dimension: the computational time. This is an important criterion when response times for establishing new connections are stringent. Each algorithm makes trade-off between computational complexity, bandwidth efficiency, and number of accepted requests. Results show that the proposed algorithms provide alternative trade-offs between the three performance metrics when compared to other existing algorithms. The alternatives provide more choice for the network providers and the best algorithm to use depends on the network's requirements. The restoration strategies used for unicast and multicast connections in this thesis are very compatible thus it is possible to integrate the restoration strategies into a single system where they share the same backup resources. Results from simulations show that using an integrated restoration model has significant benefits, which includes lower backup bandwidth requirement than the separate restoration model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GPS study for resolving the stability of Borobudur temple site</field><field name="creator">Lestari, Dwi, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The maintenance of the world???s important cultural monuments is a complex task embracing many disciplines. One important aspect of individual management plans is the stability of the monument. Borobudur, in Central Java, uncovered in a state of dilapidation in the early nineteenth century and finally restored in the second half of the twentieth century was restored using internal beams and injection technology with the view of providing a stable foundation for the foreseeable future. In the past, classical surveying separated the vertical and horizontal components. This separation often resulted in different stations having different information. Moreover, one technique was not generally able to add constraints to the other. Today's surveyors and Cultural Heritage managers use the Global Positioning System which is able to provide precise and reliable information for both the horizontal and vertical components, thereby unifying the networks and maximizing individual strengths, especially the underground marks associated with precise leveling, which are significantly less prone to local erratic movement than surface marks. Of necessity, any measurement of change involves at least two observation epochs. In general the precision is tied to the number of epochs and the span between the epochs. Since this study has had only two observation epochs, the results can only be described as preliminary or indicative. Never the less, there are a number of clear trends that are apparent. The first important point is that GPS is able to deliver precisions that are near 1 mm in the horizontal and 2-3 mm in the vertical relative to a regional fiducial control network. This is comparable to terrestrial surveying techniques. Moreover, it is accomplished in 10 to 14 days compared to many weeks for leveling. The second is that the level of redundancy and spatial coherence is very high enabling errors and outliers to be readily detected. This was used extensively as part of the quality assurance program adopted in this study. The third point is that no alarming deformation of the temple has been detected. At this stage of the study, the 95% confidence levels are quite large due mainly to only 2 epochs being observed but also in part to the way the models, especially the GLOBK model, has been implemented due to the limited number of epochs and the limited time span. It is expected that the model of tectonic motion which connects one epoch to the next will improve dramatically with a third epoch, and this will significantly improve the precision of the observation stations on the temple at the stupa level and on the buttress level. However, there is already clear evidence that some of the buttress level stations are in an unstable environment compared with stupa level stations and this is primarily due to their location. Finally, GPS offers the prospect of fast and hence repeatable work. Kinematic GPS techniques can certainly be used to densify stations and to increase our knowledge of the structural effects of deformation. However, much needs to be done to ensure that satellite tracking is of high quality and able to successfully resolve the ambiguities on an epoch by epoch basis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39994</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The decline in italian public support for the euro: The role of economic factors</field><field name="creator">De Matteis, Giulia, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis documents the changes in Italian public opinion towards the Euro. Its aim is to assess the relevance of economic factors for the decline in Italian support for the common currency. The thesis begins by assessing the extent to which support for the Euro has declined in Italy. While there has been popular, media and political comment on this issue, the thesis investigates the changes in attitude through the use of survey material and concludes that there is compelling evidence that public support for the Euro has declined in Italy. The thesis adopts a utilitarian/rational choice approach in order to investigate the reasoning behind the Italian public's developing relationship with the single currency from 1998 to the present. Its central question is: How have economic factors impacted on the Italian public's support for the Euro? The analysis focuses on Italians' perceptions - not their actual knowledge - of national and individual level economic changes brought about by the single currency. The thesis investigates how such perceptions have impacted Italian popular support for the Euro over the period 1998-2007. The method employed in this thesis is primarily based around analysing quantitative data gathered from Standard and Flash Eurobarometers. Other sources considered are academic literature and newspaper articles. The analysis clearly suggests that Italians' optimism towards their national and personal economic situations have all decreased since the Euro was introduced, concurrently with their diminishing support for the Euro. This work suggests that the main reason for decreased support lies in Italian perceptions that the Euro has contributed to worsening economic situations at both the national and individual levels. In particular, Italians believe the Euro has spurred inflation and diminished their purchasing power, and accuse it of failing to promote economic growth and jobs. However, Eurobarometer data combined with newspaper articles indicate that it is the perceived economic consequences at the individual level - loss of purchasing power due to Euro-related price increases, and pessimism towards their household financial situation - that more strongly determine Italians' decreasing support for the Euro.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public support</field><field name="subject">Euro</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Economic factors</field><field name="subject">Eurobarometers</field><field name="subject">Inflation</field><field name="subject">Purchasing power</field><field name="subject">1998-2007</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43578</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arthroscopic assessment of articular cartilage in an animal model of osteoarthritis.</field><field name="creator">Oakley, Stephen Philip, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Advances in our understanding of osteoarthritis (OA) have made development of sensitive measurement tools a priority. The literature review in this thesis found that one of the measurement tools, arthroscopy, had not been fully evaluated. This body of work evaluated the performance of arthroscopic assessments of articular cartilage (AC) in early OA with specific reference to the OMERACT filter. Preliminary studies in plastic knee arthroscopy simulation models found that estimates of AC lesion area had poor accuracy and reliability. Measurements of lesion diameter were greatly improved by the use of specially designed measurement probes but these did not prove feasible in vivo. Ovine studies evaluated discriminant and criterion validity. Biomechanical assessments served as the gold standard for AC stiffness while macroscopic, thickness and histologic assessments were used for gross structural damage. An hybrid gold standard assessment was devised to validate arthroscopic estimates of Severity and Extent of chondropathy. Arthroscopic global assessments discriminated between normal and very early OA but discrimination between different states of OA was less impressive. Assessments of the Severity of chondropathy had acceptable accuracy and moderate reliability. While arthroscopy could not examine the entire articular surface and estimates of Extent of chondropathy were subject to very large error they broadly resembled those of the hybrid gold standard assessment and they enhanced composite score performance. Composite score validity was further improved by inclusion of estimates of chondro-osteophyte. An empirical approach to composite algorithm weighting to optimise discriminant validity was developed. This approach compared favourably with previously described methods. Composite scores proved best at discriminating between normal and very early OA but were also capable of detecting small changes in OA. Arthroscopic asessments of AC damage meet the OMERACT filter criteria of Truth and Discrimination. Assessments using current arthroscopic technology should include estimates of the Extent of all grades of chondropathy. The optimal scoring algorithm should be determined empirically. Arthroscopic assessments using existing technology may be used to validate noninvasive assessments of the Severity chondropathy but not of Extent. Future efforts to improve arthroscopic assessments of AC should focus on reducing random error associated with estimates of extent.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">please verify keywords</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20500</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Co-Witnesses and the effects of discussion on eyewitness memory</field><field name="creator">Paterson, Helen M., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis was designed to investigate the effects of co-witness information on the accuracy and completeness of eyewitness memory. Co-witness information is defined as information that one eyewitness conveys to another about an event that they both observed. Very little research has focused on co-witness discussion, so the first two studies surveyed real eyewitnesses and police officers to determine how often witnesses discuss the event with one another. The results from these surveys suggested that co-witnesses commonly talk about the event with each other and this outcome provided a clear justification for studying the effects of co-witness discussion on memory. Previous research on co-witness discussion has reached inconsistent conclusions, and the possibility exists that these discrepancies are due to methodological differences. Therefore, this research aimed to determine whether co-witness discussion helps or hinders individual recall, and to investigate this within a closely defined methodological set. In a series of five experiments, participants were shown a crime video and then asked to discuss the video in groups (some of which received experimentally induced misinformation from a cowitness). Following the discussion, participants were asked to give their individual accounts of what happened. These experiments showed that exposure to postevent information from a co-witness can cause people to incorporate this information into their individual testimonies, regardless of the accuracy of the information. This phenomenon has become known as 'memory conformity'. Relevant theories were tested in order to contribute to knowledge regarding the causes of memory conformity. Furthermore, the experiments also aimed to establish whether it is possible to mediate any negative effects of co-witness discussion by employing our theoretical understanding of the causes of memory conformity. Five approaches were utilized in an attempt to reduce the negative effects of co-witness discussion: warnings about possible misinformation, source monitoring, free recall, confidence ratings, and 'remember/know judgments' (Tulving, 1985). Some evidence was found to suggest that when using 'remember/know judgments' it may be possible to distinguish 'real' memories from information obtained from a co-witness. These results are discussed in terms of theoretical and practical implications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Witnesses</field><field name="subject">Discussion</field><field name="subject">Recollection (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20663</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three dimensional scour along offshore pipelines</field><field name="creator">Yeow, Kervin</field><field name="description">Three-dimensional scour propagation along offshore pipelines is a major reason to pipeline failures in an offshore environment. Although the research on scour in both numerical and experimental aspect has been extensive over the last three decades, the focus of the investigation has been limited to the two-dimensional aspect. The knowledge on three-dimensional scour is still limited. This dissertation presents the results of an experimental investigation on threedimensional scour along offshore pipelines in (1) steady currents (2) waves only and (3) combined waves and current. The major emphasis of the investigation is to investigate the propagation of the scour hole along the pipeline after the initiation of scour. Physical experiments conducted were used to quantify the effects of various parameters on scour propagation velocities along the pipeline. The problem of monitoring real time scour below a pipeline was solved by using specifically developed conductivity scour probes. Effects of various parameters such as pipeline embedment depth, incoming flow Shields parameter, Keuglegan- Carpenter (KC) number and flow incident angle to the pipeline on scour propagation velocities along the pipeline were investigated. The investigations clearly reveal that scour propagation velocities generally increase with the increase of flow but decrease with the increase of the pipeline embedment depth. A general predictive formula for scour propagation velocities is proposed and validated against the experimental results. There are still some common issues related to pipeline scour that is lacking in the literature to date. One of these issues is the effects of Reynolds number on two-dimensional scour beneath pipelines. A numerical approach was adopted to investigate the Reynolds-number dependence of two-dimensional scour beneath offshore pipelines in steady currents. A novel wall function is proposed in calculating the suspended sediment transport rate in the model. The effects of Reynolds number were investigated by simulating the same undisturbed Shields parameters in both model and prototype but with different values of Reynolds number in two separate calculations. The results revealed that scour depths for prototype pipelines are about 10~15% smaller than those for model pipelines. The normalized time scales was found to be approximately the same, and the simulated scour profiles for the model pipelines agree well with the experimental results from an independent study. The backfilling of pipeline trenches is also an important issue to the design and management of offshore pipelines. A numerical model is developed to simulate the self-burial of a pipeline trench. Morphological evolutions of a pipeline trench under steady-current or oscillatory-flow conditions are simulated with/without a pipeline inside the trench. The two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged continuity and Navier-Stokes equations with the standard k-e turbulence closure, as well as the sediment transport equations, are solved using finite difference method in a curvilinear coordinate system. Different time-marching schemes are employed for the morphological computation under unidirectional and oscillatory conditions. It is found that vortex motions within the trench play an important role in the trench development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Underwater pipelines</field><field name="subject">Scour (Hydraulic engineering) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Reynolds number</field><field name="subject">Submarine trenches</field><field name="subject">Scour</field><field name="subject">Pipelines</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0008</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NF-kB- and mitochondria-linked signaling events that contribute to TNFa action in deferring physiological and chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in macrophages</field><field name="creator">Lo, Susan Z. Y.</field><field name="description">TNF defers apoptosis in macrophages undergoing spontaneous or pharmacologically (thapsigargin, ceramide, CCCP, etoposide or cisplatin)-induced apoptosis, as determined by measurements of caspase-3 activity and annexin-V staining (Chapter 2). The action requires TNF interaction with TNF-R1, not TNF-R2. Survival is uniquely reliant on the activity of the NF-B signaling pathway, and does not require activities arising from the PI3K/Akt, JNK, ERK, p38 MAP kinase or iNOS pathways (Chapter 3). Further, the general anti-apoptotic property of TNF and its specific antagonism of CCCP-induced apoptosis led to the finding that TNF action prevents cytochrome c release. This protection is likely mediated through effects on components of the MPTP itself, as TNF exhibited functional redundancy with the pore inhibitor cyclosporin A, and did not modify upstream events that promote MPTP opening during apoptosis, namely ROS production, cytosolic Ca2+ increase, or a reduction of total ATP (Chapter 4). Subsequent experiments with the mRNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, and the translation inhibitor, cycloheximide revealed that the protein(s) responsible for TNF-induced survival was transcribed and translated within 1 hr. However, western analyses provided no convincing evidence of the involvement of Mn-SOD, cIAP-1, XIAP, Bcl-2 or A1 in TNF cytoprotection (Chapter 5). Rather, microarray experiments identified the consistent induction of an early response gene, pim-1, within 30 min of TNF exposure (Chapter 6). This result was verified at the protein level with a specific Pim-1 antibody. Evidence was also found for induction of the anti-apoptotic protein A20, but only at mRNA level. Parthenolide, wortmannin, SP600125, PD98059, SB203580 or L-NAME1 acted against TNF-induced Pim-1 expression in a pattern that exactly matched the effects of these inhibitors on TNF-induced survival. That is, only parthenolide-mediated inactivation of NF-B abolished TNF-induced induction of Pim-1. TNF also stimulated the rapid phosphorylation (inactivation) of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein, Bad at Ser112 in a manner sensitive to NF-B inhibition, but not PI3K/Akt, JNK, ERK or p38 MAP kinase inhibition (Chapter 7). As Bad is a known substrate of Pim-1 and Bad 1 Parthenolide, wortmannin, SP600125, PD98059 and SB203580 are inhibitors of the NF-B, PI3K/Akt, JNK, ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways, respectively. L-NAME inhibits iNOS. NF-B- and mitochondria-linked signaling events that contribute to TNF action in deferring physiological and chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in macrophages ii phosphorylation occurred coincident with Pim-1 upregulation, it is likely that Pim-1 kinase activity mediates the inactivation of Bad. The overall data therefore supports a model in which TNF ligation of TNF-R1 at the cell surface results in intracellular NF- B activation, leading to the induction of Pim-1 mRNA and protein, and the ensuing phosphorylation of Bad. Inactivation of pro-apoptotic Bad increases the resistance threshold of mitochondria to apoptotic insults, thereby reducing the occurrence of mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase-3 activation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NF-kappa B (DNA-binding protein)</field><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Tumor necrosis factor</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2008.0095</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil-cadaver interactions in a burial environment</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kathryn Lisa</field><field name="description">Forensic taphonomy is concerned with investigation of graves and grave sites. The primary aim of forensic taphonomy is development of accurate estimations of postmortem interval (PMI) and/or postburial interval (PBI). Soil has previously been largely ignored, therefore this thesis is designed to investigate changes in decomposition as imparted by the soil. Furthermore the impact of cadaver interment on the surrounding soil may offer prospects for identification of clandestine graves. A series of laboratory controlled decomposition experiments using cadavers (Mus musculus) and cadaver analogues (skeletal muscle tissue (SMT); Sus scrofa, Homo sapiens, Ovis aries and Bos Taurus) were designed to investigate decomposition in burial environments. Sequential destructive harvests were carried out to monitor temporal changes during decomposition. Analyses conducted included; mass loss, microbial activity (CO2 respiration) and soil chemistry (pH, EC and extractable NH4 +, NO3 -, PO4 3- and K+). Several experimental variables were tested; frozen-thawed versus refrigerated SMT, different mammalian sources of SMT, different soil type and contribution of soil versus enteric microbial communities. Mass loss measurements for SMT experiments demonstrated a sigmoidal pattern of mass loss, however, larger cadavers (Mus musculus, 5 weeks) did not. The inhumation of SMT (frozen, unfrozen, different mammalian sources) or cadavers leads to an increase in microbial activity (CO2 respiration) within 24 hours of burial. A peak of microbial activity is attained within a week, followed by a decrease and eventual plateau. The rapid influx in microbial activity is matched by corresponding increases in pH and NH4 + concentration. pH and NH4 + are strongly correlated in soils with acidic basal pH, by comparison highly alkaline soil demonstrated no relationship. NH4 + concentration also appeared to be related directly to NO3 - concentration and cadaver or SMT mass. A decrease in NH4 + corresponds with an increase in NO3 -, however, nitrification was unpredictable. Rapid nitrification was observed in sand systems when SMT was interred, but was not noted when cadavers were interred. By comparison both sandy clay loam and loamy sand soils demonstrated rapid nitrification after inhumation of a cadaver. When cadaver or cadaver analogue mass was larger, so were NH4 + and NO3 - concentrations in systems that experienced nitrification.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic anthropology</field><field name="subject">Forensic taphonomy</field><field name="subject">Human decomposition</field><field name="subject">Soils -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Decomposition</field><field name="subject">Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Forensic taphonomy</field><field name="subject">Burial</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0065</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of multi-scale rainfall variability on flood frequency : a comparative study of catchments in Perth, Newcastle and Darwin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Samuel, Jos Martinus</field><field name="description">Issues arising from climate change and long-term natural climate variability have become the focus of much recent research. In this study, we specifically explore the impacts of long-term climate variability and climate changes upon flood frequencies. The analyses of the flood frequencies are carried out in a comparative manner in catchments located in semiarid-temperate and tropical landscapes in Australia, namely Perth, Newcastle and Darwin, using a process-based derived flood frequency approach. The derived flood frequency analyses are carried out using deterministic rainfall-runoff models that capture the intrinsic water balance variability in the study catchments, and driven by temporal rainfall event sequences that are generated by a stochastic rainfall model that incorporates temporal variabilities over a multiplicity of time scales, ranging from within-event, between-event to seasonal, multi-annual and multi-decadal time scales. Six climate scenarios are considered for Newcastle, that combine the ENSO (El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation) and IPO (Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation) modes of variability, and six different climate scenarios are considered for Perth and Darwin that combine these different ENSO modes and step changes in climate (upwards or downwards) that occurred in 1970 in both regions, which were identified through statistical analysis. The results of the analyses showed that La Ni&#241;a years cause higher annual maximum floods compared to El Ni&#241;o and Neutral years in all three catchments. The impact of ENSO on annual maximum floods in the Newcastle catchment is enhanced when the IPO is negative and for Perth, the impact of ENSO weakens in the post-1970 period, while it strengthens in Darwin in the same period. In addition, the results of sensitivity and scenario analyses with the derived flood frequency model explored the change of dominant runoff generation processes contributing to floods in each of the study catchments. These analyses highlighted a switch from subsurface stormflow to saturation excess runoff with a change of return period, which was much more pronounced in Perth and Darwin, and not so in Newcastle. In Perth and Darwin this switch was caused by the interactions between the out-of-phase seasonal variabilities of rainfall and potential evaporation, whereas the seasonality was much weaker in Newcastle. On the other hand, the combination of higher rainfall intensities and shallower soil depths led to saturation excess runoff being the dominant mechanism in Newcastle across the full range of return periods. Consequently, within-storm rainfall intensity patterns were important in Newcastle in all major flood producing events (all return periods), where they were only important in Perth and Darwin for floods of high return periods, which occur during wet months in wet years, when saturation excess runoff was the dominant mechanism. Additionally, due to the possibility of a change of process from subsurface stormflow to saturation excess when conditions suited this switch, the estimates of flood frequency are highly uncertain especially at high return periods (in Darwin and Perth) and much less in Newcastle (when no process change was involved).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climatic changes -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Flood forecasting -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">Water balance (Hydrology)</field><field name="subject">Watersheds -- Western Australia -- Perth</field><field name="subject">Watersheds -- New South Wales -- Newcastle</field><field name="subject">Watersheds -- Northern Territory -- Darwin</field><field name="subject">Flood frequency</field><field name="subject">Multi-scale rainfall variability</field><field name="subject">Rainfall model</field><field name="subject">Downward approach</field><field name="subject">Climate variability and change</field><field name="subject">Perth, Newcastle, Darwin catchments</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0066</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular changes in the topoisomerase genes, gyrA and parC, and their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance in the pathogenic Neisseria.</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Tiffany Rose, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined molecular changes in the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the topoisomerase genes, gyrA and parC of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis and their contribution to fluoroquinolone resistance (FQR). Initially models of FQR emergence were developed from analysis of resistant mutants generated in vitro. The effects of the nature and order of sequential changes in GyrA and ParC on FQR were explored by correlating QRDR changes with ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations. The in vitro models were validated by comparisons of QRDR changes and MICs in two populations of wild-type FQR N. gonorrhoeae over a wide MIC range (0.09 to 24??g/mL), and in a wild type FQR meningococcus. The in vitro activities of three newer quinolones with differential activity on GyrA and ParC were compared with that of ciprofloxacin. Key findings were that the initial QRDR changes always occurred in gyrA and were the predominant influence on phenotypic expression of FQR. QRDR alterations were acquired sequentially and two GyrA and two ParC changes represented the full complement of changes observed in gonococci and two GyrA and one ParC change those in meningococci. GyrA alterations at Ser-91 in gonococci and Thr???91 in meningococci were pivotal for the development of further resistance. ParC changes required the presence of two GyrA alterations for any major impact on FQR. ParC substitutions, Ser-87???Arg and Glu-91???Gly in gonococci and Cys- 85???Asp and Glu-91???Lys in meningococci led to the expression of the highest FQR levels. Examination of FQR in wild-type meningococci was necessarily restricted, but analyses using the broader MIC range available in in-vitro-derived FQR meningococci (0.09 to 16??g/mL) revealed the first ParC changes in N. meningitidis. The study also redefined QRDR boundaries and described novel mutations within them. The nature of sequence changes in GyrA and ParC in FQR Neisseria also affected the relative activities of the three newer quinolones. Trovafloxacin was the most active quinolone in vitro but MIC differences with ciprofloxacin were mutation-dependent. Grepafloxacin and moxifloxacin were only slightly more active than ciprofloxacin in the presence of multiple QRDR changes. This thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between QRDR alterations and FQR in N. gonorrhoeae and offers insights into the potential for FQR development in N. meningitidis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quinolone antibacterical agents -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</field><field name="subject">Neisseria meningitidis</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance in microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27298</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection, characterization and mitigation of interference in receivers for global navigation satellite systems</field><field name="creator">Tabatabaei Balaei, Asghar, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">GPS has become very popular in recent years. It is used in wide range of applications including aircraft navigation, search and rescue, space borne attitude and position determination and cellular network synchronization. Each application places demands on GPS for various levels of accuracy, integrity, system availability and continuity of service. Radio frequency interference (RFI) which results from many sources such as TV/FM harmonics, radar or mobile satellite systems, presents a challenge to the use of GPS. It can affect all the service performance indices mentioned above. To improve the accuracy of GPS positioning, a continuously operating reference station (CORS) network can be used. A CORS network provides all the enabled GPS users in an area with corrections to the fundamental measurements, producing more precise positioning. A threat to these networks is a threat to all high-accuracy GPS users. It is therefore necessary to monitor the quality of the received signal with the objective of promptly detecting the presence of RFI and providing a timely warning of the degradation of system accuracy, thereby boosting the integrity of GPS. This research was focused on four main tasks: a)	Detection. The focus here is on a power spectral density fluctuation detection technique, in which statistical inference is used to detect narrowband continuous-wave (CW) interference in the GPS signal band after being captured by the RF front-end.  An optimal detector algorithm is proposed. At this optimal point, for a fixed Detection Threshold (DT), probability of false alarm becomes minimal and for a fixed probability of false alarm, we can achieve the minimum value for the detection threshold. Experiments show that at this point we have the minimum computational load. This theoretical result is supported by real experiments. Finally this algorithm is employed to detect a real GPS interference signal generated by a TV transmitter in Sydney.  b)	Characterization. In the characterization section, using the GNSS signal structure and the baseband signal processing inside the GNSS receiver, a closed formula is derived for the received signal quality in terms of effective carrier to noise ratio ( ). This formula is tested and proved by calculating the C/No using the I and Q data from a software GPS receiver. For pulsed CW, a similar analysis is done to characterize the effect of parameters such as pulse repetition period (PRP) and also duty cycle on the received signal quality. Considering this characterization and the commonality between the GPS C/A code and Galileo signal as a basis to build up a common term for satellite availability, the probability of satellite availability in the presence of CW interference is defined and for the two currently available satellite navigation systems (GPS L1 signal and Galileo signal (GIOVE-A BOC(1, 1) in the E1/L1 band)) it is shown that they can be considered as alternatives to each other in the presence of different RFI frequencies as their availability in the presence of CW RFI is different in terms of RFI frequency.  c)	Mitigation. The last section of the research presents a new concept of ?Satellite Exclusion Zone?. In this technique, using our previously developed characterization techniques, and considering the fact that RFI has different effects on different satellite signals at different times depending on satellite Doppler frequency, the idea of excluding the most vulnerable satellite signal from positioning calculations is proposed. Using real data and real interference, the effectiveness of this technique is proven and its performance analyzed.  d)	Hardware implementation. The above detection technique is implemented using the UNSW FPGA receiver board called NAMURU.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interference.</field><field name="subject">GPS.</field><field name="subject">Receiver.</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="subject">Inertial navigation systems.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in surveying.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in navigation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40545</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disturbances of autonomic functions in spinal cord injury: autonomic dysreflexia and thermoregulation</field><field name="creator">Kalincik, Tomas, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Disorders of the autonomic nervous system constitute serious complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) and their treatment is usually highly prioritised by spinal patients. Among these, autonomic dysreflexia and impaired thermoregulation are potentially life threatening conditions and require effective management. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), progenitor cells and polymeric scaffolds have been tested in animal models of SCI and some of them have been considered for clinical trials. However, evaluation of the effect of such interventions on autonomic functions has received only rudimentary attention and would require a more thorough experimental assessment before the methods are utilised in human patients. This thesis tested two potential therapeutic strategies for autonomic dysreflexia and examined disorders of thermoregulatory functions in a rat model of spinal cord transection. Magnitude and duration of autonomic dysreflexia were evaluated with radio telemetry in spinalised animals treated with (i) implants of OECs and olfactory neurosphere-derived cells seeded in poly(lactic co glycolic) porous scaffolds or with (ii) transplants of OECs alone. (iii) Effects of SCI and of OECs on the morphology of sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs; which are involved in pathogenesis of autonomic dysreflexia) stained for NADPH diaphorase were examined. (iv) Doppler ultrasonography and infrared thermography were used to assess responses of tail blood flow and surface temperature to cold. Transplants of OECs alone, but not in combination with olfactory neurosphere-derived cells and polymeric scaffolds, resulted in significantly shortened episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. This may be attributed to the alterations to the morphology of SPNs adjacent to the lesion: a transient increase in the morphometric features of the SPNs was evoked by spinal cord transection and this was further altered by transplantation of OECs. The thesis also showed that local responses of tail blood flow and temperature to cold were not abolished by complete SCI suggesting that temperature homeostasis could still be maintained in response to cold. It is hypothesised that OECs facilitate improved recovery from autonomic dysreflexia through alteration of the morphology of SPNs. Furthermore, it is suggested that the role of the tail in heat conservation can be regulated by mechanisms that are independent of the descendent neural control from supraspinal centres.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermoregulation</field><field name="subject">spinal cord injury</field><field name="subject">autonomic dysreflexia</field><field name="subject">olfactory ensheathing cells</field><field name="subject">olfactory stem cells</field><field name="subject">sympathetic preganglionic neurons</field><field name="subject">infrared thermography</field><field name="subject">radio-telemetry</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43516</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The operating costs of taxing the capital gains of individuals : a comparative study of Australia and the UK, with particular reference to the compliance costs of certain tax design features</field><field name="creator">Evans, Christopher Charles, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the impact of aspects of tax design on the operating costs of the tax system.  The thesis focuses on the Australian and UK regimes for taxing the capital gains of individuals.  It contends that the compliance burden faced by personal taxpayers and the administrative costs incurred by revenue authorities are directly influenced by the design of the capital gains tax ('CGT') regimes in each country.  The study bridges the divide between theoretical analysis of CGT and empirical studies on tax operating costs.  It uses a hybrid research design to test a series of hypotheses that emerge from a review of the literature and the experience of the researcher.  It combines a technical analysis of the relevant Australian and UK legislative provisions (including an analysis of the policy and other background data that underpins those provisions) with empirical research on the views and experience of practitioners who are responsible for the operation of the legislation in the two countries.  The results obtained from this combined methodology indicate that the operating costs of taxing capital gains in Australia and the UK are directly affected by the design of the legislative provisions.  Moreover, the study outcomes indicate that operating costs in both countries are high (on a number of comparative measures), have not reduced over time, and are both horizontally and vertically inequitable.  The research indicates that the primary factors that cause the high operating costs include the complexity of the legislation and the frequency of legislative change, together with record-keeping and valuation requirements.  The thesis identifies specific legislative changes that would address operational cost concerns.  These include the phasing out of the 'grandfathering' exemption together with the introduction of an annual exempt amount, and the rationalisation of business concessions in Australia; and the abolition of taper relief and its possible replacement with a 50% exclusion in the UK.  More importantly, it seeks a more principled approach to the taxation of capital gains in both countries, and emphasises that legislative change can and should only be enacted with a full and clear understanding of the operating cost implications of that change.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">capital gains tax</field><field name="subject">tax compliance costs</field><field name="subject">tax operational costs</field><field name="subject">tax design</field><field name="subject">comparative taxation</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Taxation</field><field name="subject">Compliance costs</field><field name="subject">Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Tax administration and procedure.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20738</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and Numerical Investigation of the Physics of Microstructured Optical Fibres</field><field name="creator">Kuhlmey, Boris T</field><field name="description">We describe the theory and implementation of a multipole method for calculating the modes  of microstructured optical fibers (MOFs).

W. H</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the application of plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) to polymers. PIII requires that a high negative potential be applied to the surface of the material while it is immersed in a plasma. This presents a problem for insulating materials such as polymers, since the implanting ions carry charge to the surface, resulting in a charge accumulation that effectively neutralises the applied potential. This causes the plasma sheath at the surface to collapse a short time after the potential is applied.     Measurements of the sheath dynamics, including the collapsing sheath, are performed using an electric probe. The results are compared to theoretical models of the plasma sheath based on the Child-Langmuir law for high voltage sheaths. The theoretical model predicts well the sheath dynamics for conductive substrates. For insulating substrates the model can account for the experimental observations if the secondary electron coefficient is modified, justified on the basis of the poly-energetic nature of the implanting ions.     If a conductive film is applied to the insulator surface the problem of charge accumulation can be avoided without compromising the effectiveness of PIII. The requirement for the film is that it be conductive, yet transparent to the incident ions. Experimental results are presented which confirm the effectiveness of the method. Theoretical estimates of the surface potential show that a film of the order of 5nm thickness can effectively circumvent the charge accumulation problem. Efforts to produce and characterise such a film form the final two chapters of this thesis. The optimal thickness is determined to be near the percolation threshold, where a marked increase in conductivity occurs. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is shown to be an excellent method to determine the film thickness and percolation threshold non-invasively.     Throughout this work cathodic vacuum arcs are used to deposit thin films and as a source of metal plasmas. The design and construction of a pulsed cathodic vacuum arc forms a significant part of this thesis.

The problem is motivated by the advantages offered by distributed autonomous sensing systems and the challenges they present. The focus of this   study is on Macro Sensor Networks, characterized by platform mobility, heterogeneous teams, and long mission duration. The system under consideration may consist of an arbitrary number of mobile autonomous robots, stationary sensor platforms, and human operators, all linked in a  network.      This work describes a comprehensive framework called Active Sensor Network (ASN) which addresses the tasks of information fusion, decistion making, system configuration, and user interaction. The main design objectives are scalability with the number of robotic platforms, maximum flexibility in implementation and deployment, and robustness to component and communication failure. The framework is described from three complementary points of view: architecture, algorithms, and  implementation.    The main contribution of this thesis is the development of the ASN architecture. Its design follows three guiding principles: decentralization, modularity, and locality of interactions. These principles are applied to all aspects of the architecture and the framework in general. To achieve flexibility, the design approach emphasizes interactions between components rather than the definition of the components themselves. The architecture specifies a small set of interfaces sufficient to implement a wide range of information gathering systems.    In the area of algorithms, this thesis builds on the earlier work on Decentralized Data Fusion (DDF) and its extension to information-theoretic decistion making. It presents the Bayesian Decentralized Data Fusion (BDDF) algorithm formulated for environment features represented by a general probability density function. Several specific representations are also considered: Gaussian, discrete, and the Certainty Grid map.  Well known algorithms for these representations are shown to implement various aspects of the Bayesian framework.    As part of the ASN implementation, a practical indoor sensor network has been developed and tested. Two series of experiments were conducted, utilizing two types of environment representation: 1) point features with Gaussian position uncertainty and 2) Certainty Grid maps. The network was operational for several days at a time, with individual platforms coming on and off-line. On several occasions, the network consisted of 39 software components. The lessons learned during the system's development may be applicable to other heterogeneous distributed systems with data-intensive algorithms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decentralized information fusion;decentralized decision making;active sensor networks;mobile robots</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/661</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Britain 1939-1945: The economic cost of strategic bombing</field><field name="creator">Fahey, John T</field><field name="description">The strategic air offensive against Germany during World War II formed a major part of Britain&#65533;s wartime military effort and it has subsequently attracted the attention of historians.  Despite the attention, historians have paid little attention to the impact of the strategic air offensive on Britain. This thesis attempts to redress this situation by providing an examination of the economic impact on Britain of the offensive.  The work puts the economic cost of the offensive into its historical context by describing the strategic air offensive and its intellectual underpinnings.  Following this preliminary step, the economic costs are described and quantified across a range of activities using accrual accounting methods.  The areas of activity examined include the expansion of the aircraft industry, the cost of individual aircraft types, the cost of constructing airfields, the manufacture and delivery of armaments, petrol and oil, and the recruitment, training and maintenance of the necessary manpower.  The findings are that the strategic air offensive cost Britain &#65533;2.78 billion, equating to an average cost of &#65533;2,911.00 for every operational sortie flown by Bomber Command or &#65533;5,914.00 for every Germany civilian killed by aerial bombing.  The conclusion reached is the damage inflicted upon Germany by the strategic air offensive imposed a very heavy financial burden on Britain that she could not afford and this burden was a major contributor to Britain&#65533;s post-war impoverishment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategic bombing;RAF;Britain;Commonwealth;World War II;Germany;economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/664</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Proximal Soil Sensing System for the Continuous Management of Acid Soil</field><field name="creator">Viscarra Rossel, Raphael A</field><field name="description">The notion that agriculturally productive land may be treated as a relatively homogeneous resource at thewithin-field scale is not sound. This assumption and the subsequent uniform application of planting material,chemicals and/or tillage effort may result in zones within a field being under- or over-treated. Arising fromthese are problems associated with the inefficient use of input resources, economically significant yield losses,excessive energy costs, gaseous or percolatory release of chemicals into the environment, unacceptable long-term retention of chemicals and a less-than-optimal growing environment. The environmental impact of cropproduction systems is substantial. In this millennium, three important issues for scientists and agrariancommunities to address are the need to efficiently manage agricultural land for sustainable production, themaintenance of soil and water resources and the environmental quality of agricultural land.Precision agriculture (PA) aims to identify soil and crop attribute variability, and manage it in an accurate andtimely manner for near-optimal crop production. Unlike conventional agricultural management where anaveraged whole-field analytical result is employed for decision-making, management in PA is based on site-specific soil and crop information. That is, resource application and agronomic practices are matched withvariation in soil attributes and crop requirements across a field or management unit. Conceptually PA makeseconomic and environmental sense, optimising gross margins and minimising the environmental impact ofcrop production systems. Although the economic justification for PA can be readily calculated, concepts suchas environmental containment and the safety of agrochemicals in soil are more difficult to estimate. However,it may be argued that if PA lessens the overall agrochemical load in agricultural and non-agriculturalenvironments, then its value as a management system for agriculture increases substantially.Management using PA requires detailed information of the spatial and temporal variation in crop yieldcomponents, weeds, soil-borne pests and attributes of physical, chemical and biological soil fertility. However,detailed descriptions of fine scale variation in soil properties have always been difficult and costly to perform.Sensing and scanning technologies need to be developed to more efficiently and economically obtain accurateinformation on the extent and variability of soil attributes that affect crop growth and yield. The primary aimof this work is to conduct research towards the development of an &#65533;on-the-go&#65533; proximal soil pH and limerequirement sensing system for real-time continuous management of acid soil. It is divided into four sections.Section one consists of two chapters; the first describes global and historical events that converged into thedevelopment of precision agriculture, while chapter two provides reviews of statistical and geostatisticaltechniques that are used for the quantification of soil spatial variability and of topics that are integral to theconcept of precision agriculture. The review then focuses on technologies that are used for the completeenumeration of soil, namely remote and proximal sensing.Section two comprises three chapters that deal with sampling and mapping methods. Chapter three provides ageneral description of the environment in the experimental field. It provides descriptions of the field site,topography, soil condition at the time of sampling, and the spatial variability of surface soil chemicalproperties. It also described the methods of sampling and laboratory analyses. Chapter four discusses some ofthe implications of soil sampling on analytical results and presents a review that quantifies the accuracy,precision and cost of current laboratory techniques. The chapter also presents analytical results that show theloss of information in kriged maps of lime requirement resulting from decreases in sample size. The messageof chapter four is that the evolution of precision agriculture calls for the development of &#65533;on-the-go&#65533; proximalsoil sensing systems to characterise soil spatial variability rapidly, economically, accurately and in a timelymanner. Chapter five suggests that for sparsely sampled data the choice of spatial modelling and mappingtechniques is important for reliable results and accurate representations of field soil variability. It assesses anumber of geostatistical methodologies that may be used to model and map non-stationary soil data, in thisinstance soil pH and organic carbon. Intrinsic random functions of order k produced the most accurate andparsimonious predictions of all of the methods tested.Section three consists of two chapters whose theme pertains to sustainable and efficient management of acidagricultural soil. Chapter six discusses soil acidity, its causes, consequences and current management practices.It also reports the global extent of soil acidity and that which occurs in Australia. The chapter closes byproposing a real-time continuous management system for the management of acid soil. Chapter seven reportsresults from experiments conducted towards the development of an &#65533;on-the-go&#65533; proximal soil pH and limerequirement sensing system that may be used for the real-time continuous management of acid soil.Assessment of four potentiometric sensors showed that the pH Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET)was most suitable for inclusion in the proposed sensing system. It is accurate and precise, drift and hysteresisare low, and most importantly it&#65533;s response time is small. A design for the analytical system was presentedbased on flow injection analysis (FIA) and sequential injection analysis (SIA) concepts. Two different modesof operation were described. Kinetic experiments were conducted to characterise soil:0.01M CaCl2 pH(pHCaCl2) and soil:lime requirement buffer (pHbuffer) reactions. Modelling of the pHbuffer reactions describedtheir sequential, biphasic nature. A statistical methodology was devised to predict pHbuffer measurements usingonly initial reaction measurements at 0.5s, 1s, 2s and 3s measurements. The accuracy of the technique was 0.1pHbuffer units and the bias was low. Finally, the chapter describes a framework for the development of aprototype soil pH and lime requirement sensing system and the creative design of the system.The final section relates to the management of acid soil by liming. Chapter eight describes the development ofempirical deterministic models for rapid predictions of lime requirement. The response surface models arebased on soil:lime incubations, pHbuffer measurements and the selection of target pH values. These models aremore accurate and more practical than more conventional techniques, and may be more suitably incorporatedinto the spatial decision-support system of the proposed real-time continuous system for the management ofacid soil. Chapter nine presents a glasshouse liming experiment that was used to authenticate the limerequirement model derived in the previous chapter. It also presents soil property interactions and soil-plantrelationships in acid and ameliorated soil, to compare the effects of no lime applications, single-rate andvariable-rate liming. Chapter X presents a methodology for modelling crop yields in the presence ofuncertainty. The local uncertainty about soil properties and the uncertainty about model parameters wereaccounted for by using indicator kriging and Latin Hypercube Sampling for the propagation of uncertaintiesthrough two regression functions; a yield response function and one that equates resultant pH after theapplication of lime. Under the assumptions and constraints of the analysis, single-rate liming was found to bethe best management option.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proximal Soil Sensing System</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/674</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A political ecology of living aquatic resources in Lao PDR</field><field name="creator">Bush, Simon R</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_AU</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laos</field><field name="subject">Aquatic resources</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology</field><field name="subject">Fishery resources</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/975</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Lidcombe program of early stuttering intervention</field><field name="creator">Jones, Mark A</field><field name="description">Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_AU</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stuttering</field><field name="subject">Lidcombe Program</field><field name="subject">RCT Randonised Controlled Trial</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Biostatistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/977</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in lung volume in asthma with particular reference to obesity</field><field name="creator">Schachter, L.

Predicting sediment transport in nearshore regions, however, is one of the most challenging tasks faced by coastal researchers in designing coastal structures or beach nourishment schemes. Although nearshore sediment transport mainly occurs in the longshore direction, cross-shore sediment transport is crucial in determining the shoreline evolution and beach morphology . . . This study investigated the factors influencing sediment re-suspension and cross-shore suspended sediment flux in the frequency domain through a series of field measurements conducted at several different locations and a numerical model. Only oscillatory flow components were examined and the mean flow components were not considered. Although many different factors such as cross-shore location with respect to breaker line, significant wave height to water depth ratio (Hs/h), normalised horizontal velocity skewness (&lt;u&#179;&gt;/&#8249;u&#178;&#8250;&#179;/&#178;), median grain size (d50), breaker type, and wave groupiness appeared to influence the magnitude of cross-shore suspended sediment flux, bed ripples was identified as the major contributing factor in changing the direction of suspended sediment flux due to incident swell waves. Moreover, the direction changed significantly with ripple type. High frequency measurements, obtained to examine the influence of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) on higher sediment suspension events observed under wave groups indicated that higher TKE was generated at the seabed by approaching wave groups, which in turn resulted in higher suspension events.&#176;1</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coastal engineering</field><field name="subject">Coast changes</field><field name="subject">Beach erosion</field><field name="subject">Sediment transport</field><field name="subject">Suspended sediments</field><field name="subject">Sediment re-suspension</field><field name="subject">Bed ripples</field><field name="subject">Cross-shore sediment flux</field><field name="subject">Turbulant kinetic energy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2007.0005</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of some naturally occurring quinones</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, Linda Birgitta</field><field name="description">Naturally occurring quinones have attracted considerable interest due to their widespread occurrence, structural diversity and often potent biological activities.

Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of elecanacin 36, an unusual cyclobuta-fused naphthalene-1,4-dione derivative which has been isolated from the bulbs of the iris Eleutherine americana Merr. et Heyne (Iridaceae), along with the isomeric and well-known pyranonaphthoquinones eleutherin 38 and isoeleutherin 39. Chapter 3 focuses on an approach to 3-hydroxymethylfuro[3,2-b]naphtho[2,3-d]furan-5,10-dione 37, which has been isolated from the wood of the tropical tree Crescentia cujete L.

In recent years, interest has turned toward using RFID in supply chain management, such as monitoring and tracking business processes. There are many businesses that have already invested in an RFID supply chain management solution but little is known about the current state of diffusion of RFID technology and the role of advocacy groups in the diffusion process. This research investigated the current state of RFID diffusion in New Zealand according to diffusion of innovation and Moore&#8217;s theory to provide insight into the role of innovation advocacy groups such as New Zealand RFID Pathfinder Group (referred as the NZ RFID Pathfinder Group). RFID in supply chain management terms is inter-organisational and much of the role of advocacy groups is in networking between players in the supply chain management context. Therefore, this research focused on industry group leaders. The research was conducted in two main parts, an online questionnaire survey and a follow up interview. The online questionnaire survey used a quantitative approach while the interview used a qualitative one. In summary, the result show that: 14% industries (seven out of 51) have already adopted RFID technology, the industries were from importer, research institute, manufacturing, and distribution; 36% have plans (16 out of 44) to adopt RFID technology in the near future, the industries were from importer, research institute, manufacturing, and distribution; and 64% industries (28 out of 44) did not any plan to adopt RFID. The strong recommendation was to standardise each aspect of the technology, making the products available to clients and creating competition between RFID technology service suppliers, thus bringing down the cost through market forces. Increasing the number of members of advocacy group could also encourage RFID adoption. One group of potential RFID adopters in the future will be local branches of international companies with a mandate to adopt RFID technology. The results suggest that the NZ RFID Pathfinder Group should set the direction of NZ RFID adoption; get involved in national pilots; and the activities of lobbying governments and associations and information sharing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Technology and business</field><field name="subject">Innovation theory</field><field name="subject">Diffusion theory</field><field name="subject">Advocates</field><field name="subject">Advocacy groups</field><field name="subject">New Zealand RFID Pathfinder Group</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/543</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What can I understand about children with special needs from the musical offerings that emerge in the music therapy process? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Music Therapy at New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cammell, Shane</field><field name="description">This arts-based research thesis sought to understand two children with special needs, through their musical offerings within the context of their music therapy sessions. The process of understanding the children came through firstly listening to and extracting meaningful musical data from recordings of their sessions. This data included both actual excerpts of the musical interplays between the child and music therapist (myself), and more broadly, underlying themes drawn from the recorded session material. The data was then creatively &#8216;melded&#8217;, resulting in two original instrumental works, herein referred to as 'songs'. Before, during and after writing the songs, rigorous analyses were undertaken utilising both a formal approach, via the use of a contextual question framework, and two creative approaches: free-form narration and data-led imagery. The contextual question framework, involving the repetitive use of two key questions - where? and why? - sought to understand the data&#8217;s context, its purpose for inclusion, and its influence on the respective song. One of the creative approaches, that of free-form narration, sought to, rather than analysing the song through formal structures, instead &#8216;tell the song&#8217;s story&#8217;, narratively conveying the experience of being with the child in his music. The other creative approach, that of data-led imagery, involved creating images during and after being &#8216;immersed&#8217; in the musical data, employing instinctive or subconscious means to further develop the therapist&#8217;s understanding of the child&#8217;s musical offerings, and moreover, the child himself. Upon completion of the two songs, it was discovered that clinical themes present from the sessions strongly influenced the song creation process. Results also strongly supported the validity of arts-based research as a viable means of analysing music created with children with special needs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/861</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative study of the ethical practice of newly graduated nurses working in mental health : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Butters, Katheryn Janine</field><field name="description">Despite nurses having legitimate ethical rights and responsibilities, they are often constrained in practice from acting in ways they believe to be morally correct. This thesis presents a qualitative exploration of factors that influenced eight newly graduated nurses as they endeavoured to practice ethical mental health nursing in New Zealand. Data was gathered from in depth interviews with the participants and analysed using a thematic analysis method. A critical lens was employed to view the data so as to make visible aspects of the social and political context within which the participants were situated. The participants? moral practice was profoundly influenced by a number of relational experiences they had. These relationships were then determinants in their moral development, professional socialization and their ability to practice in accordance to their moral beliefs. Key aspects of these relationships were their experiences with nursing education and the influence of the organisations where they worked. Recommendations are made to both areas to enable and support moral nursing practice for new graduate mental health nurses. New graduate nurses inherently desire to practice in a way that honours the client and is therefore inherently ethical. Moral nursing practice is an everyday occurrence that must be situated in a culture of respect and regard for both clients and nurses. New graduate nurses have much to offer the profession and the tangata whaiora of the mental health services. They must be valued and supported to act in accordance to their moral ideals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychiatric nursing</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">qualitative study</field><field name="subject">moral nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321204 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/860</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurse managers' ethical conflict with their health care organizations : a New Zealand perspective : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Health Service Management at Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chalmers, Linda Maree</field><field name="description">Immersed in a context of constrained health resources, nurse managers are at great risk of the experience and negative consequences of values clashes and ethical conflict, such as burnout and attrition. Replicating a qualitative descriptive study previously conducted in Canada (Gaudine &amp; Beaton, 2002) this research is aimed at increasing knowledge of the experience of nurse managers&#8217; ethical conflict with their health care organizations in New Zealand. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from eight nurse managers in New Zealand, which was analyzed using a general inductive approach to qualitative research. The experience of advocating for values that may be shared by both nursing and the health care organization, such as safety, teamwork and quality patient care, were revealed in the conceptual category of Nursing Management Advocacy. As with their Canadian study counterparts, Isolation was revealed as a key factor that made the experience of ethical conflict worse and involves the social experiences of silencing, employment barriers and invisibility. Support describes the factors that mitigated the experience of ethical conflict and involves personal, professional and organizational support, and are likewise similar to the experiences of Canadian nurse managers. The Bottom Line describes a focal point of the experience of ethical conflict where the health care organizations predominantly fiscal bottom line was confronted and challenged by nurse managers, and where the nurse manager might reach their own bottom line and choose to leave the organization. Being and Becoming Nursing Leaders describes the outcomes of ethical conflict for nurse managers who were not only transformed into nursing leaders, through learning, reflection, and growth but also counted the costs of nursing leadership. This study concludes that supportive colleagues, organizational structures and culture are essential to mitigating the experience of ethical conflict and isolation which nurse managers encounter. The study also concludes that reducing isolation and supporting nurse managers will ensure that nursing values are appropriately represented and articulated in the health care organization&#8217;s decision making systems and processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing management</field><field name="subject">nursing leaders</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321215 Health care administration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/862</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Providing resilient quality of service connections in provider-based virtual private networks</field><field name="creator">Rosenbaum, Gustav Filip, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on efficient provisioning of resilient Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. It first confirms the intuition that network resources can be more efficiently utilized when resilience mechanisms are implemented by a network provider in the physical network than by its VPN customers in their VPNs. Next, a Multiprotocol Label Switching-based programmable VPN architecture is presented that delivers virtual links as resilient quality of service (QoS) connections and virtual sites. Virtual sites allow customers to implement functionality like customized routing and content adaptation ???in the cloud???, as opposed to the current network model where all functionality is implemented at the network edge. To provision a resilient QoS connection, two paths need to be computed from the ingress to the egress nodes, such that both paths meet the given QoS constraints. Two different frameworks have been proposed in the literature to compute resilient QoS connections when the QoS constraints are bandwidth and end-to-end delay. They both use a preprocessing step whereby either all links with less residual capacity than the given bandwidth constraint are pruned, or the given end-to-end delay is converted to an effective bandwidth. The frameworks thus reduce the problem to one with only a single constraint. We argue in this thesis that these frameworks individually lead to poor network utilization and propose a new framework where both constraints are considered simultaneously. Our framework exploits the dependency between endto- end delay, provisioned bandwidth and chosen path through using the provisioned bandwidth as a variable. Here, two link-disjoint paths are computed together with their respective minimum bandwidths such that both the bandwidth and end-to-end delay constraints are satisfied.  Given our framework we first propose a new generic algorithm that decomposes the problem into subproblems where known algorithms can be applied. Then we propose two new linear programming (LP) formulations that return the two paths and their respective bandwidths such that they have the minimum combined cost. To make our framework applicable in a production environment, we develop two new algorithms with low run times that achieve even higher network performance than their LP formulation counterpart. These algorithms systematically use an algorithm that computes non-resilient QoS connections. As no algorithm for computing nonresilient QoS connections with sufficiently low run time has been proposed in the current literature we develop two new algorithms and their respective heuristics with a run time comparable to Dijkstra???s shortest-path algorithm. Our simulations show that exploiting the dependency between end-to-end delay, provisioned bandwidth and chosen path can significantly improve the network performance.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extranets (Computer networks)</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises - Computer networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25989</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talent development in music: a comparative study between Sydney (Australia) and Seoul (Korea) on the emergence of talent, especially the interface between giftedness and talent</field><field name="creator">Park, Jeongmin, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate factors which can influence the emergence of high musical ability during the developmental process of musical talent achievement, comparing students in Seoul (Korea) and those in Sydney (Australia). The main focuses of the investigation concern the comparison of musical giftedness demonstrated in early childhood, the developmental process, and various factors, such as the environmental and intrapersonal, which can affect the emergence of talent, especially in those of different cultural backgrounds. For this purpose, Gagn????s Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT, Gagn??, 2003) was adopted as an analytical tool for the present study, in particular for empirical research.  A total number of 137 students and 88 parents participated in this research. Student participants consisted of two groups: young musicians aged below 10 who show high musical achievements; and teenage students who are musically superior. All students completed a questionnaire, and their parents also completed a questionnaire. Data showed some significant differences between students in the two countries.  Three research instruments are employed based on Harnischmacher (1997). SCI (the Self-Concept Scale of Instrumental Abilities), GOP (Goal Orientation of Practice) and EAD (External Action Distraction) were included in the student questionnaire in order to examine intrapersonal catalysts (motivation) which can affect the developmental process of musical talent. A significant difference was found in SCI between countries. Self-concept of student groups in Sydney was significantly higher than that of students in Seoul among all age groups concerning musical abilities.  However, there were no significant differences in GOP and EAD between students in Seoul and Sydney. Other differences emerged concerning the role of parents, expenditure on music lessons, time spent on practice, and environmental factors. In particular, cultural milieu was revealed as one of important environmental factors in the present study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">talent</field><field name="subject">talent development</field><field name="subject">giftedness</field><field name="subject">musical ability</field><field name="subject">early musical signs</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">phases of musical learning</field><field name="subject">Mozart</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43522</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of synthetic approaches towards molecules with potential SERM activity</field><field name="creator">Da Silva, Paulo Alexandre Reis, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this project was to develop organometallic methodologies for the conversion of aryl benzyl ketones into aryl- and/or aroyl- substituted stilbenes related to Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs): Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, respectively. Consideration was given to target molecules that were acyclic, cyclic or heterocyclic. A secondary aim of the project was to develop methodologies that would allow combinatorial methods to be applied to the synthesis of these compounds, allowing quick access to a diverse range of SERM-candidate libraries of compounds. Primary methodologies that were examined included: Grignard, organocerium, and palladium-catalysed Negishi, Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. In addition, the rearrangement reaction of epoxides and nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides were explored as secondary means of new C-C bond construction. It was found the Grignard chemistry demanded the application of heat and suffered greatly from competing deprotonation reactions of the ketones due to the basicity of the organomagnesium reagents. The corresponding, less basic, organocerium reagents also gave low yields (0-11%). While these methodologies demonstrated some advantages, such as the direct addition of the nucleophilic components to the carbonyl groups of model ketones, they demonstrated some limitations, which were poor yields and restriction to using only carbonyl containing starting materials. Palladium-catalysed Negishi cross-coupling methodology was reliable in C-C bond formation but gave only moderate yields of isolated products. Stille reagents gave crosscoupled products readily and in high yields with sterically unhindered reactants, such as the enol triflate of ??- tetralone. However, they did not readily cross-couple with the corresponding ??-enol triflate and ??-vinyl bromide reactants. This became an insurmountable barrier to their widespread use in SERM synthesis but did provide a sequence with selectivity. The Suzuki methodology was discovered to be superior to other methods of cross-coupling and the most reliable in furnishing both ??- and ??-coupled products in high yields. The yield of the palladium-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction at the ??-position was found to follow the following order of reactivity: I &amp;gt Br &amp;gt OTf, in keeping with literature precedent, while the stability of the palladium-catalyst, and the choices of base and solvent affected the outcome of the reaction. The Suzuki reaction was also employed in a three-component carbonylative reaction to furnish unsymmetrical ketones, in model reactions towards Raloxifene-like structures, but the products were obtained in low to moderate yields. Initial investigations into the synthesis of closer model compounds through two-fold Suzuki cross-coupling reactions were limited by access to suitable precursors and this indicated a direction for future research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogens</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22411</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Edge-transitive homogeneous factorisations of complete graphs</field><field name="creator">Lim, Tian Khoon</field><field name="description">[Formulae and special characters can only be approximated here.  Please see the pdf version of the abstract for an accurate reproduction.]  This thesis concerns the study of homogeneous factorisations of complete graphs with edge-transitive factors. A factorisation of a complete graph Kn is a partition of its edges into disjoint classes. Each class of edges in a factorisation of Kn corresponds to a spanning subgraph called a factor. If all the factors are isomorphic to one another, then a factorisation of Kn is called an isomorphic factorisation. A homogeneous factorisation of a complete graph is an isomorphic factorisation where there exists a group G which permutes the factors transitively, and a normal subgroup M of G such that each factor is M-vertex-transitive. If M also acts edge-transitively on each factor, then a homogeneous factorisation of Kn is called an edge-transitive homogeneous factorisation. The aim of this thesis is to study edge-transitive homogeneous factorisations of Kn. We achieve a nearly complete explicit classification except for the case where G is an affine 2-homogeneous group of the form ZR p x G0, where G0 is less than or equal to &#915;L(1,p to the power of R).   In this case, we obtain necessary and sufficient arithmetic conditions on certain parameters for such factorisations to exist, and give a generic construction that specifies the homogeneous factorisation completely, given that the conditions on the parameters hold. Moreover, we give two constructions of infinite families of examples where we specify the parameters explicitly. In the second infinite family, the arc-transitive factors are generalisations of certain arc-transitive, self-complementary graphs constructed by Peisert in 2001.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complete graphs</field><field name="subject">Factorization (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Homogeneous factorisations</field><field name="subject">Generalised Paley graphs</field><field name="subject">2-transitive permutation groups</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2004.0039</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship Marketing in Australian Professional Sport: An Organisational Perspective</field><field name="creator">Stavros, Constantino</field><field name="description">Relationship marketing has become a fundamental concept within modern marketing thought. Some authors even suggest it is the fundamental concept. Its rise to prominence has seen it become a unifying force within the marketing discipline given its application to a whole range of areas. It promises benefits to organisations that can be distilled down to greater profits over the longer term, with less cost. The focus of relationship marketing is relatively simple. Rather than acquiring customers, the retention and development of customers is emphasised. Regrettably, the implementation of relationship marketing is not as straightforward as its definition. It requires at the very least a long-term outlook, an embracing of technology and a commitment to a customer focus. If relationship marketing is such a critical element in modern marketing, it follows that its application across industry sectors be examined. Sport is one such industry and has coincidentally emerged as a major business sector in the same time-frame as relationship marketing's maturity. As the markets for sport have grown, so too has the sophistication of the sport marketer. From amateur, myopic beginnings, sport continues to claim a strong grip on the cultural identity of countries such as Australia. Buoyed by strong media interest, attendance at sporting events continues to grow, albeit across a much larger choice-set. The road ahead is not necessarily bountiful however. Information presented in Chapter 1 of this thesis suggests that the frequency of individual attendance at major sports in Australia is declining, despite some positive overall attendance figures. In essence, it appears that loyal customers are being replaced by newer, less committed ones. While this might not be instantly damaging, it does require sport marketers to ensure that strong levels of identification with their products are developed. All of this is supported by the existing literature that has recognised that sport can likely benefit greatly from the implementation and application of relationship marketing, but is in urgent need of further study. These scenarios suggest a need to understand where relationship marketing in sport currently rests and this thesis answers the call and asks the following research questions: RQ1) To what extent do professional sporting organisations in Australia undertake relationship marketing; RQ2) what strategies do they employ and RQ3) what are the issues faced in implementing a relationship marketing approach? This thesis takes an organisational perspective, across multiple-cases in major professional sport and considers the sport-consumer relationship exclusively. It is the first study of its kind in this area and adds significantly to the body of knowledge, both within sport marketing and the broader concept of relationship marketing. It indicates that while relationship marketing is acknowledged and indeed welcomed as a concept by practitioners, their efforts at implementation have been primitive, largely unplanned and generally sporadic. More than often they reflect a reactive rather than proactive strategic approach. A range of barriers are presented and discussed as are some examples of organisations that have incorporated some parts of a relationship marketing philosophy into their structure. A conceptual model in the final chapter of this thesis synthesises the issues extracted from the various cases and existing literature. It depicts a challenging road ahead for professional sport organisations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">customer focus</field><field name="subject">sport-consumer relationship</field><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">Australian professional sport</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20090522.165115</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Health And Public Health In Australian Rural General Practice: A Case Series Of Research, Clinical Applications  And Educational Strategies</field><field name="creator">Fraser, John</field><field name="description">Background General practice&#8217;s population health and public health role is being promoted internationally to improve health outcomes. 1-6  This Thesis aims to: &#8226; Describe and evaluate projects which are relevant to exploring the interface of population health and public health with Australian rural general practice; and &#8226; Describe and evaluate projects which can increase population health and public health expertise and capacity amongst our future rural general practice workforce.  Methods This Thesis uses a descriptive design. A series of research papers published in the peer reviewed literature are presented in each chapter.  These papers are used as case studies to explore the aims of this Thesis.  A variety of quantitative and qualitative methods have been used to conduct research in remote communities of the Northern Territory, rural South Australia and New South Wales from 1992 to 2005. Results Public health and population health can interface with Australian rural general practice in sustainable models described in case studies within this Thesis. There is a continuum of roles in this interface from population health in practice, public health, &#8216;new&#8217; public health and leadership.  Population health activities include screening and promotion of lifestyle factors to patients.7 Public health activities can be developed to extend the reach of health programs to the broader community.  This may include participation in population based surveillance systems and health promotion projects. Promoters of &#8216;new&#8217; public health 8,9 support an expansion of  public health&#8217;s scope to include advocating  social development through community participation and empowerment.  Leadership can extend to policy development and liaison with general practice, population health and public health practitioners to promote collaborative models of health care. A sustainable model of increasing rural workforce recruitment via developing workforce capacity in public health and population health has been developed and evaluated as part of this Thesis. Conclusions This Thesis presents rural Australian case studies demonstrating integration of population health and public health roles with general practice.  Vertically integrated workforce models have been developed, as part of this Thesis, which can facilitate recruitment to the rural health workforce. In the long term, educational models have been developed and evaluated as part of this Thesis. These models can increase the population health and public health expertise and capacity of this workforce.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">population health</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">general practice</field><field name="subject">rural health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.13/24740</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and reactivity of some activated heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="creator">Alamgir, Mahiuddin, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An alternate approach to the synthesis of calix[3]indoles has been demonstrated, but further attempted synthetic approaches to calixindoles using new leaving groups led to uncharacterized polymeric products. The synthesis of new 7,7'-diindolylmethane- 2,2'-dicarbaldehydes gives potential for further ligand design and metal complex formation. In addition, 4,6-dimethoxyindole-7- carbaldehydes have been effectively converted to a range of 6-methoxyindole-4,7-diones by Dakin oxidation.  Various electrophilic substitution reactions have been performed on the 4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles. Formylation, acylation, acid catalyzed addition of formaldehyde and nitration revealed that the activated benzimidazoles are less reactive at the specified C-7 position compared to the analogous indoles. The key starting material for a potential calixbenzimidazole was synthesized by the selenium dioxide oxidation of 2-methyl-7-formyl-4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazole and by oxidative cleavage of 4,6-dimethoxy- 2-styrylbenzimidazole by Lemieux-Johnson reagent followed by reduction. Nevertheless, attempted preparation of calixbenzimidazole from 2-hydroxymethyl-4,6-dimethoxy benzimidazole led to formation of a dibenzimidazolyl ether. The synthesis of some novel activated bisbenzimidazoles has been developed. Furthermore, benzimidazoles were incorporated into new ligand systems which have led to a wide range of acyclic quadridentate neutral metal complexes.  Activated benzimidazoles overall illustrate one electron irreversible oxidation to form a radical cation followed by multielectron oxidations. On the other hand, the nickelII and cobaltII benzimidazole metal complexes investigated showed one electron ligand centered reversible reduction. Irreversible radical cation oxidation followed by multielectron oxidation of the metal complexes further demonstrates the rich electrochemical nature of the 4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles.  Some novel 7-(indol-2-yl)-4,6-dimethoxybenzimidazoles were prepared with indolin-2-one and triflic anhydride and an alternate procedure afforded 2-(4,6-dimethoxyindol-7-yl)-benzimidazoles from activated indoles and 2-benzimidazolinone.  Two new isomeric series of 2-substituted-5,7-dimethoxybenzothiazoles and 2-substituted-4,6-dimethoxybenzothiazoles were synthesized via Jacobson cyclization.

The models studied include the union jack model, the alternating Heisenberg chain, the Heisenberg bilayer model, and the spin-Peierls model. The union jack model is a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin model with frustration, and is analyzed using spin-wave theory. For small values of the frustrating coupling $\alpha$, the system is N{\' e}el ordered, while for large $\alpha$ the frustration is found to induce a canted phase. Spin wave theory with second order corrections finds the critical coupling at $\alpha \simeq 0.645$,which agrees quantitatively with series expansion results. No intermediate spin-liquid phase is found to exist between the two phases. The alternating Heisenberg chain is studied using an alternative triplet-wave expansion formalism for dimerized spin systems, modification of the ??bond operator?? formalism of Sachdev and Bhatt. Projection operators are used to confine the system to the physical subspace, rather than constraint equations. Comparisons are made with the results of dimer series expansions and exact diagonalization. The S=1/2 Heisenberg bilayer spin model at zero temperature is studied in the dimerized phase using analytic triplet-wave expansions and dimer series expansions. The occurrence of two-triplon bound states in the S=0 and S=1 channels, and antibound states in the S=2 channel, is predicted with triplet-wave theory and confirmed by series expansions. All bound states are found to vanish at or before the critical coupling separating the dimerized phase from the N{\' e}el phase. The critical behavior of the total and single-particle static transverse structure factors is also studied by series expansion methods and found to conform with theoretical expectations. The Heisenberg spin-Peierls model with dispersive, gapless phonons is studied with Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods. We investigate the zero temperature properties of the model using the crossover method. The calculations were found to converge poorly and no conclusive results could be found using this method.

If meaningful comparisons are to be made at the jurisdictional level, a standardised treatment outcome monitoring system must be developed and implemented, that takes into account differences in client characteristics, treatment settings and modes of service provision. A brief, multi-dimensional instrument, the Brief Treatment Outcome Measure (BTOM) has been developed for routine, ongoing treatment outcome monitoring with clients receiving opioid maintenance pharmacotherapy (OMP) services in New South Wales (NSW), and for use in treatment evaluation research. This is the first time in Australia that an attempt has been made to integrate outcome monitoring into routine clinical practice across an AOD treatment sector. The BTOM contains thirty-three items across the domains of dependence, blood-borne virus exposure risk, drug use, health/psychological functioning and social functioning. The internal reliability of the BTOM is satisfactory; retest reliabilities for the measures are good to excellent and concurrent validation of BTOM scales yielded acceptable agreement. Average completion times of the BTOM were 14.5 minutes when administered by researchers and 21 minutes by clinicians. A 30-month feasibility trial was conducted in selected NSW OMP treatment agencies to determine the practicability of implementing an OMS; to identify issues that would impact on the quality of the data; and identify administrative processes that could facilitate implementation whilst minimising the burden on agency staff. In addition, clinicians who had administered the BTOM were surveyed 18 months into the trial to ascertain their attitudes towards the clinical utility, acceptability of content and the level of support given to them to administer the BTOM as part of routine clinical practice. Results from the trial indicate that the BTOM measures are sensitive to change over time; that the change observed is consistent with that reported in the OMP treatment outcome literature; and that clinicians, whilst generally being positively predisposed towards using the instrument, express concerns relating to the burden of administering and the clinical utility of conducting outcome monitoring.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Opioid habit</field><field name="subject">Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20546</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of bacteria associated with Australian wine grapes using cultural and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Bae, Sung Sook, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a systematic investigation of bacterial species associated with wine grapes cultivated in Australian vineyards during 2001-2004. Grapes, sampled throughout cultivation, were analysed for bacterial species using a combination of cultural and molecular methods. Red (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot) and white (Chardonnay, Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc) grape varieties were examined. Factors affecting the bacterial ecology of grapes were considered. The bacterial populations of mature undamaged grapes at harvest were consistently low at 102-103 CFU/g. Higher populations (103-106 CFU/g) were found on grapes at earlier stages of maturity and correlated with application of Bacillus thuringiensis as a biological pesticide. B. thuringiensis was the most prevalent bacterial species on wine grapes throughout cultivation, as determined by plate culture, enrichment culture and PCR-DGGE. B. thuringiensis carried over into wine processing but did not grow in juice or wine and did not adversely affect the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Oenococcus oeni in liquid culture. B. thuringiensis inhibited the growth of several spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi found on grapes. Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens was the second most prevalent species detected on wine grapes. Its populations rarely exceeded 103-104 CFU/g. Other bacteria (Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas) were sporadically found on grapes. Lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria were rarely detected on undamaged grapes by culture and PCR-DGGE methods. A greater incidence of lactic acid bacteria was detected by specific enrichment procedures, especially on damaged grape berries. Species found were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus mali, Lactobacillus lindneri and Lactobacillus kunkeei. The malolactic organism, O. oeni, was never isolated from any grape sample, raising questions about its enological origin. Enrichment cultures also revealed the presence of other bacteria (e.g. Sporolactobacillus inulinus, Asaia siamensis) not previously found on wine grapes. Atypical, hot and dry conditions during cultivation may account for the low populations of bacteria found on wine grapes. This factor combined with the overwhelming presence of B. thuringiensis prevented meaningful comparisons of data to determine influences of vineyard location, grape variety, grape maturity, climate and viticultural practices on the bacterial ecology of grapes. More systematic and controlled studies of these variables are required.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolution of iron oxides by oxalic acid</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sung Oh, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The iron content of industrial minerals can be reduced by physical and chemical processing. Chemical processing is very efficient to achieve a high degree of iron removal at minimum operating cost. Both inorganic acids and organic acids have been used for clay refining. However, due to environmental pollution and contamination of products with the SO42- and Cl-, inorganic acids should be avoided as much as possible. This research investigated the use of oxalic acid to dissolve iron oxides and the dissolution characteristics of natural iron oxides. The dissolution of iron oxides in oxalic acid was found to be very slow at temperatures ranging from 25??? to 60???, but increased rapidly at a temperature above 90oC with increasing oxalic acid concentration, whereas the pH caused the reaction rate to decrease at pH&amp;gt2.5 and improved the rate from pH 1 to pH 2.5. The iron oxides such as goethite (??-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (??-FeOOH) and iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)3) can be dissolved faster at the presence of magnetite which exhibits an induction period at the initial stage and showed the bell-shaped curves for the dissolution. In titration tests, however, the increase of temperature causes an increase in solubility of the oxalate complexes, resulting in an increased stability of ionized species in solution. During the addition of NaOH, NaHC2O4???H2O was precipitated without forming Na2C2O4???H2O, but it was re-dissolved at pH&amp;gt4.0. On the other hand with NH4OH, NH4HC2O4???H2O and (NH4) 2C2O4???H2O co-precipitated at pH 0.93, but also re-dissolved at over pH 2.03. The reaction temperature was found not to affect the removal of iron from the ferric oxalate complex solution using lime. Iron is removed as iron hydroxide and calcium oxalate is then precipitated during the iron removal step. The formation of Fe(OH)3 in the solution was affected by the dissociation of Ca(OH)2. The thermodynamics of sodium, ammonium and iron oxalate complexes were investigated and the standard free energy, ??Go was calculated using thermodynamic data and solubility products. The dissolution of pure hematite by oxalate was found to follow a shrinking core model of which the kinetic step of the reaction is the controlled mechanism.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23924</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived benefits for customer service of ITIL IT control use</field><field name="creator">Egeler, Markus</field><field name="description">IT service management is becoming more and more important in the current business environment. Especially the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a widely adopted and accepted IT service management framework (Wagner 2006). Organizations that adopt one of the IT service management frameworks expect to achieve a large range of benefits through the use of the frameworks. The major benefits that are expected to be realised include reduced costs, IT services that are tailored to the business needs, a higher quality of IT services, and improved customer satisfaction (OGC 2007a). Despite the growing importance and acceptance of IT service management and ITIL, there is not much literature that is concerned with the benefits that can be realised when one of the relevant IT service management frameworks is in place. Only a few studies were published in conference proceedings (e.g. Hochstein et al. 2005, Potgieter et al. 2005, Cater-Steel et al. 2006). Even though these studies were able to confirm some of the claims made by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), the publisher of the ITIL series, there are still a lot of claims that are not evaluated to date. This thesis is taking a Monte-Carlo method based simulation approach to identify some of the benefits of the ITIL for customer service. To achieve this, an initial research model was developed that represents the four most likely benefits for customer service of the use of ITIL and their relationship with customer service and the generation of business value. Subsequently the different path ways for the relationships were explored and models for each of the possible paths were designed. These models include a mediated model, an unmediated model and a partially mediated model. After defining the estimates and constraints for the simulation, the simulation was executed using a MS Excel spreadsheet. The simulation results presented a large amount of data for each of the models and their relationships. The models produced normal distributions and showed stability for changed input and throughput parameters. The analysis of the findings showed that the changes in estimates for each of the models and the associated results of the simulation followed a linear pattern. The linearity of the models combined with the normal distribution of the results offers a lot of opportunities for the use of the developed models. A further enhancement through a test with real-life data could provide the basis for a tool to quantitatively predict the impact of an ITIL implementation on customer service and the creation of value for the business. In addition the four most likely contributors to improved customer service based on the use of ITIL have been identified from a literature review. The identified contribution towards improved customer service of these four beneficiary factors is supported by the results of the simulation. Therefore the results of this thesis provide the research community with a model that could provide the basis for further exploration of the beneficiary effects of ITIL on customer service.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology infrastructure library</field><field name="subject">Quantitative approach</field><field name="subject">Information technology</field><field name="subject">Business strategy</field><field name="subject">Capability maturity</field><field name="subject">IT service management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/546</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An immunologically inspired self-set for sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Bokareva, Tatiana, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), consisting of many small sensing devices working in concert, have the potential to revolutionise every aspect of our lives. Although the technology is still in its infancy offers an unlimited number of possible applications, ranging from military surveillance to environmental monitoring. These WSNs are prone to physical sensor failures due to environmental conditions such bio fouling and an adverse ambient environment, as well as threats that arise from their operation in an open environment. Consequently, reliability and fault-tolerance techniques become a critical aspect of the research associated with WSNs. In mission critical applications, such as the monitoring of enemy troops, unreliable or faulty information produced by WSNs could potentially lead to fatal outcomes. In such applications, it necessary to receive both a correct notification of event occurrences and uncorrupted data. Developing a fault-tolerance system for WSNs is a challenging task. New self-configuration, self-recognition and self-organisation techniques are needed due to unique aspects of the operation of WSNs. Our current understanding of WSNs leads to an immunologically inspired solution to the design of a fault-tolerant network. One of the main roles of the Natural Immune System(NIS) is the recognition of self and the elimination of non-self proteins. Hence, in order to have an immune system equivalent for a sensor network, we must have a clear and stable definition of what constitutes the Self and the Non-Self Sets in a sensor network. This thesis explores two different approaches to modelling, collection and representation of the Self-Set in distributed sensor networks. We approach this problem, of identifying what constitutes the Self-Set in terms of sensor readings, using pattern recognition techniques from the machine learning field that leverages a small number of past observations of sensor nodes. We have chosen Competitive Learning Neural Network (CLNN) for the construction of the Self-Set. We define and evaluate two approaches for the aggregation of the Self-Set across multiple sensors in a WSN. The first approach is the Graph Theory Based Aggregation (GTBA) which consists of two main parts, namely: classification of the sensor readings by means of CLNN, which provides the multimodal view data and GTBA of the CLNN output, which takes intersections of intervals produced by CLNN. In this thesis we define and evaluate two different interpretations of GTBA, namely: Midpoint Intersection (MPI): one that considers the midpoint of intervals. Midpoint Free Intersection (MFI): one that does not take the midpoints into account but assigns the confidence levels to each of the resulted intersections. We evaluated both interpretations on three different types of phenomena and have shown that the second interpretation, MFI, consistently produced more precise representations of the environment under observation. However, MFI produced a very strict representation of the phenomenon, which consequently led to a large number of systems' retraining. Hence, we defined and evaluated a technique which produced a more relaxed representation of the Self-Set and at the same time preserved the finer variation in the phenomenon. The second approach is based on unsupervised learning. We define and evaluate three related unsupervised learning procedures ?? Divergence and Merging (DMP), Suboptimal Clustering (SOC), and Simple Clustering (SC) for the collection of the Self-Set. We explore the design tradeoffs in unsupervised learning schemes with respect to the clustering quality. We implement and evaluate these related unsupervised learning procedures on a realworld data set. The outcome of these experiments show that, out of the three unsupervised learning procedures studied in this thesis, the Suboptimal Clustering procedure appears to be the most suitable for the classification of sensor readings, provided that the amount of free memory is large enough to store and recluster an entire training set. We evaluate aggregation of the Self-Set produced by means of the distributed implementation of the unsupervised learning procedures. The aggregation is based on extended unsupervised learning and we evaluate the possibilities of the autonomous retraining of the system. Our experiments show that, in a naturally slowly changing environment, 40% of nodes reporting deviations is a large enough number to reinitialise the retraining of the system. The final conclusion is that it is possible to have a distributed implementation of the unsupervised procedure that  produces an almost identical representation of the environment, which  makes unsupervised learning suitable for a large number of sensor network architectures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Self-set</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43396</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smokescreen : black/white/male/female bravery and southeast Australian bushfires</field><field name="creator">Finlay, Christine, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Black/white/male/female struggles over knowledge correctness and who is brave are examined inductively in the field of bushfires. The paradoxes of a white male icon are linked to contradictions in gender theories in disaster. In mainstream literature, assumptions of innate white male superiority in bravery justify white women???s diminution and white male domination. In feminist theory, women???s diminution is the problem and their bravery for struggling against hegemony applauded. Philosophies of bravery are explored in 104 semistructured interviews and 12 months??? fieldwork as a volunteer bushfirefighter. There is great variety in the ways volunteers cope with bushfires. However, evidence of white male hegemony emerges when volunteers complain of state and territory indifference to preventing property and environmental damage and injury and death. Evidence is examined that Indigenous Australians once managed bushfires better than a sprawl of bureaucracy. Bushfire service claims that Aborigines knew nothing about hazard reductions are contradicted. This debate over bushfire management leads to the discovery of a third epistemology breaking with claims of white male iconic bravery and bureaucratic mastery. To generalise about the habitus of claims to knowledge and bravery, I analyse Newcastle Herald articles from 1881-1981. Three competing knowledge fields and their associated struggles are examined; Indigenous Australians and white womens??? emancipatory struggles confront data on bushfirefighting. Bushfires emerge as a serious problem, a bureaucratic power base and a white male icon from the 1920s.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest fires - Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest fighters - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23006</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE  P2X7  RECEPTOR  OF  HUMAN  LEUKOCYTES</field><field name="creator">Gu, Baijun</field><field name="description">Lymphocytes from normal subjects and patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) show functional responses to extracellular ATP characteristic of the P2X7 receptor.  These responses include opening of a cation selective channel/pore which allows entry of the fluorescent dye, ethidium+ and activation of a membrane metalloprotease which sheds the adhesion molecule L-selectin.  In this thesis, the surface expression of P2X7 receptors was measured in normal leucocytes, platelets and B-CLL lymphocytes and compared with their functional responses.   Monocytes showed 4-5 fold greater expression of P2X7 than B-, T- and NK- lymphocytes, while P2X7 expression on neutrophils and platelets was weak.  All cell types demonstrated abundant intracellular expression of this receptor. All 12 subjects with B-CLL expressed surface P2X7 at about the same level as for B-lymphocytes from normal subjects.  P2X7 function, measured by ATP-induced uptake of ethidium, correlated closely with surface expression of this receptor in normal and B-CLL lymphocytes and monocytes. However, the ATP-induced uptake of ethidium into the malignant B-lymphocytes in 3 patients was low or absent.  The lack of P2X7 function in these B-lymphocytes was confirmed by the failure of ATP to induce Ba2+ uptake into their lymphocytes. This lack of function of the P2X7 receptor resulted in a failure of ATP-induced shedding of L-selectin, an adhesion molecule which directs the recirculation of lymphocytes from blood into the lymph node.   To study a possible genetic basis of non-functional P2X7 receptor, we sequenced DNA coding for the carboxyl terminal tail of P2X7.  In 33 of 130 normal subjects a heterozygous nucleotide substitution (1513A--C) was found while 3 subject carried the homozygous substitution which codes for glutamic acid to alanine at amino acid position 496.  Surface expression of P2X7 on lymphocytes was not affected by this 496Glu--Ala polymorphism demonstrated both by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescent staining.  Monocytes and lymphocytes from the 496Glu--Ala homozygote subject expressed non-functional receptor while heterozygotes showed P2X7 function which was half that of wild type P2X7.  Results of transfection experiments showed the mutant P2X7 receptor was non-functional when expressed at low receptor density but regained function at a high receptor density.  This density-dependence of mutant P2X7 function was also seen on differentiation of fresh monocytes to macrophages with interferon-gamma which upregulated mutant P2X7 and partially restored its function. P2X7-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes was impaired in homozygous mutant P2X7 compared with wild type. The data suggest that the glutamic acid at position 496 is required for optimal assembly of the P2X7 receptor.  Apart from the 496Glu--Ala polymorphism, three other single nucleotide polymorphisms, 155His--Tyr, 348Ala--Thr and 568Ile--Asn were also found in the P2X7 receptor. The site directed mutant cDNA were generated for all 3 polymorphisms and transfected into HEK293 cells to study the impact of these polymorphisms on P2X7 function. Results suggested that Ile568 is important for P2X7 protein trafficking to cell surface.  Further study of these two loss-of-function polymorphisms (496Glu--Ala and 568Ile--Asn) may help better understanding of the functional domains in the P2X7 receptor and its role in CLL, lymphoma and infectious diseases.    Conclusions:  1.P2X7 receptor is expressed in human leukocytes, including lymphocytes, natural killer cells as well as monocytes, on both surface and intracellular locations.  2.Both the expression and function of P2X7 are highly variable between in human individuals.  Non-functional P2X7 receptors are found in some subjects, including both normal subjects and CLL patients, and are often associated with defects in ATP-induced cytotoxicity and L-selectin shedding.  3.Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 496Glu--Ala and 568Ile--Asn, are found at low frequency in the human population and lead to the loss-of-function of P2X7.  Both permeabllity function and the downstream effects mediated by P2X7 are affected by these two SNPs.  The mechanisms for the loss-of-function differs between the two polymorphisms.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">P2X7 receptor;single nucleotide polymorphism;chronic lymphocytic leukemia;ATP-induced ethidium uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/501</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Varieties of Capitalism: National Institutional Explanations of Environmental Product Developments in the Car Industry</field><field name="creator">Mikler, John</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multinational corporations, environment, car, institutions, varieties of capitalism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/1736</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Base Forming Materials For Amalgam Restorations</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Roland W</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Dentistry -- Materials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4700</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liminal Sites/ Designing Marginal Space in Broadmeadows</field><field name="creator">Bratoeva, Chaya</field><field name="description">Liminal sites are those on the verge of change, between boundaries and in a temporary state of ambiguity.

I was hoping to tie these together in a more coherent way and write reflectively to deepen those relations.       I declined practicing architecture (late 2003-2006), inflamed an old love affair with 'fine art' and curated sound-art events, designed art-theatre-performance works and installations, continued free-prose writings and visited specific Australian and aboriginal (continent) places and adjacent world destinations.

It makes a consistent critical appraisal of the philosophical presumptions under which architectural theory is made, in particular, the relationship between theories of expression and representation. The thesis presents seven distinct projects by the author which developmentally explore the degree to which architecture is able to represent the sublime - in particular through the concept of horror. In this instance horror emerges as a category of excess that supervenes the uses of the term in the genres of film and literary studies. Within the thesis horror describes an (impossible) objective for representation   The thesis argues that the environment within which these philosophical questions of 'effect' may most resonantly be explored is, ultimately, digital media. The author draws on contemporary commentary by Jacques Derrida and Georges Bataille, in particular Derrida's discussion of the Parergon and contemporary discussion of l'informe, the informal to support these arguments. It is within the apparently 'real' environments of virtual reality that the presentation of the mise-en-scene of horror may be explored. Immersive digital environments, it is argued, provide an appropriate level of freedom and direction for the exploration of the spatial experience of the abyss. The thesis concludes by presenting observations on the antinomy of aspirations that any materialist theory of architectural practice must attend to when working within digital media.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">horror</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">digital</field><field name="subject">virtual reality</field><field name="subject">installation</field><field name="subject">photography</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090525.162052</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I understand it well, but I cannot say it proper back: language use among older Dutch migrants in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crezee, Ineke Hendrika Martine</field><field name="description">The purposes of this study were (a) to examine two groups of healthy older Dutch English bilingual migrants in a New Zealand setting to investigate whether they were showing signs of L2 attrition with accompanying L1 reversion post-retirement, and (b) to identify possible factors which might play a role in the incidence of any L2 attrition and concomitant L1 reversion. Previous research has focused on similar groups of migrants in the Australian context, while New Zealand based research has focused on language shift and maintenance amongst three generations of migrants. The research design involved an analysis of sociolinguistic life, using questionnaires. These included self-assessments of L1 and L2 proficiency at three key times: on arrival in New Zealand, at time of ultimate attainment and post-retirement. Further, an analysis of assessments of respondents&#8217; L1 and L2 proficiency pre-and post-retirement completed by interviewees&#8217; adult children moderated respondents&#8217; self-reports. The findings revealed a considerable overlap between participants&#8217; self-reports and assessments by their adult children. The study also revealed a relationship between participants&#8217; level of prior education and their ultimate attainment in the L2, with those who had come to New Zealand having learned English at Secondary School English very likely to have achieved a &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;very good&#8221; level of L2 proficiency. Conversely, those who had not learned the L2 at secondary school prior to arriving in New Zealand, were less likely to have achieved a &#8220;very good&#8221; level of ultimate attainment as evident both from self-reports and assessments by adult children. The design also included a linguistic analysis of elicited free speech. Data focused on key indicators of age, gender, social class, prior education, occupation and predominant linguistic environment pre- and post-retirement. Free speech was examined for code-switching, response latency and L1 structure in respondents&#8217; spoken L2. Results indicated that a majority of respondents showed minimal if any signs of L2 attrition with concomitant L1 reversion, both as evidenced by their spoken L2 and as indicated by self-reports and assessments by adult children. Any signs of L2 attrition which were found appeared linked to respondents&#8217; level of prior education and L2 proficiency on arrival in New Zealand. Being exposed to a predominantly L1 social environment post-retirement also appeared to result in a lifting of the threshold for L2 lexical items, resulting in a slightly increased response latency in the spoken L2. Three participants said they experienced some problems expressing their healthcare needs to medical professionals, to the extent that they were searching for words. All stated they &#8220;got there in the end&#8221; but needed more time to paraphrase their health needs. Two subjects avoided the use of the L2 during the interview, even when prompted in English.

These include greater expectations, new technology, reduced product lifecycles, high project failure rates, and the pressures from competition. This presents a significant challenge for a product development team as it leaves companies searching for opportunities to gain an advantage in the market place. The low level of research performed in relation to SMEs over the past number of years, especially in the field of New Product Development (NPD), has resulted in an increase in interest by practitioners and academics. This research was aimed at exploring the pre-development phase currently employed by SMEs within the New Zealand manufacturing industry. The purpose was to gauge the understanding and importance of this early stage in NPD amongst practitioners from these SMEs, as the literature highlighted this as an area of weakness requiring empirical research. Specifically, the objectives set for this research investigation were to survey manufacturing SMEs in New Zealand, compare the findings with past and current research on a national and international level, and make conclusions in relation to: &#8226; The nature and complexity of the pre-development activities performed by New Zealand manufacturing SMEs. &#8226; The difficulties and/or limitations New Zealand manufacturing SMEs encounter whilst implementing the pre-development activities. &#8226; The importance of and attitude towards the pre-development phase with regards to the overall NPD process and the company&#8217;s product development efforts. The study consisted of a questionnaire survey, run during June and July 2007 with twenty-two SMEs representing the light engineering/manufacturing, electronics, and food industry sectors. The questionnaire survey was followed up with one-on-one interviews with some of the participating companies allowing for both quantitative and qualitative data to be obtained. The research investigation found that the difficulties in carrying out the five predevelopment activities studied were common, compounded by the lack of skills inhouse to do so. Of the five pre-development activities studied, the preliminary technical analysis was found to be given the most attention by the companies with regard to overall project time, with lesser emphasis placed on the other four activities. Many of the companies developed &#8216;new to the world&#8217; products or entered new markets with existing products where they primarily took part in the business-tobusiness market. Good relationships existed between the manufacturing SMEs and their suppliers, distributors and customers. Management were found to have a high level of involvement in product planning, as they tend to be involved in key decision making in NPD in SMEs. Many of the companies had difficulty when it came to identifying opportunities and customer needs, with the addition of numerous barriers limiting the implementation of NPD. The greatest difficulties arose during the practical implementation of tools and techniques due to several challenges, such as limited budgets, lack of time and resources as well as incompatibility within the existing company culture. Clearly, the pre-development phase is the basis for the remainder of the NPD process with essential development decisions being made here. This phase is therefore crucial in determining the likely outcome of NPD projects. The research findings suggested that greater consideration and effort should be placed on the pre-development phase, even more so with the cost increasing exponentially when mistakes are made later in development. The study highlighted the need to improve the tools and techniques available for use during the pre-development phase, as companies are aware of its importance but find it the most difficult to undertake. High new product failure rates; over-expenditure of project time; lack of awareness, commitment, and formality; and the high level of difficulty experienced by the New Zealand SMEs studied, suggests there is a need for the implementation of better tools and techniques during the predevelopment phase to aid successful NPD in New Zealand manufacturing SMEs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">new product development</field><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">pre-development activities</field><field name="subject">product planning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/863</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient catalysts for heterocycle synthesis-a high throughput approach</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Danielle Frances, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into tandem catalysed synthesis of polycyclic heteroatom containing molecules and the utilisation of high throughput screening (HTS) methodologies to identify active catalysts. Methodology for the high throughput screening of in situ generated metal complexes as catalysts was developed. UV spectroscopy and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) were developed as effective methods of screening combinatorial arrays of complexes as catalysts. HTS methodologies were applied to the screening of in situ generated complexes as catalysts for the hydroamination of 2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline. Two complexes were identified to be highly active hydroamination catalysts in acetone; the in situ combinations of [Rh(CO)2Cl]2/mesBIAN 38/NaBF4 and Ir(COD)Cl]2/NaBF4. Also identified in this work was the formation of the unusual N-(2-methylvinyl)-2-phenylindole catalysed by [IrCp*Cl2]2/NaBF4 from 2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline via the incorporation of one molecule of acetone.  Complexes of the type [Cp*MCl(N-N)][X] were synthesised (M = Rh(III) / Ir(III)), N-N= bpm 31, bim 32, dmbpm 61, bik 62, mesBIAN 38 and mesim-mim 63, X= Cl-, BF4-, [Cp*MCl3]-). Where N-N was bpm 31 or bim 32 and there was no alternate counterion present, bimetallic complexes formed containing the counterion X= [Cp*MCl3]-. The three dimensional, solid state, structures of the cationic fragments of the bimetallic complexes [Cp*MCl(N-N)][X] (M= Ir, X= [Cp*IrCl3]-, N-N= bpm 31 and bim 32; M= Rh, X= [Cp*RhCl3]-, N-N= bpm 31; M= Ir, X= BF4 -, N-N= bim 32, mesBIAN 38 and mesim-mim 63) are presented. Abstraction of the chloride, in complexes of the type [Cp*IrCl(N -N)]BF4, by AgBF4 created active catalysts in situ with the best catalyst in the series for the hydroamination of 2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline [Cp*IrCl(mesBIAN)]BF4/AgBF4.  Investigations performed into the synthesis of N-(2-methylvinyl)-2-phenylindole catalysed by [IrCp*Cl2]2/BF4- have shown that the most likely potential mechanism proceeds via the initial catalysed formation of the imine followed by metal promoted cyclisation. The isolation of the complex [IrCl2(2-(2-phenylethynyl)aniline)Cp*] and investigation into its reactivity showed it to be a potential reactive intermediate in the catalytic cycle. Investigation into catalysed C-C bond formation of N-propargylindole identified the in situ generated complex [Rh(CO)2Cl]2/PPh3 as a catalyst for the generation of pyrroloquinoline as a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heterocyclic chemistry.</field><field name="subject">Catalysts.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40898</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultra-tight integration of GPS/Pseudolites/INS: system design and performance analysis</field><field name="creator">Swarna, Ravindra Babu, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The complementary advantages of GPS and INS have been the principle driving factor to integrate these two navigation systems as an integrated GPS/INS system in various architectural forms to provide robust positioning.  Although the loosely coupled and tightly coupled GPS/INS systems have been in existence for over a decade or two and performed reasonably well, nevertheless, the tracking performance was still a concern in non-benign environments such as dynamic scenarios, indoor environments, urban areas, under foliages etc., where the GPS tracking loops lose lock due to the signals being weak, subjected to excessive dynamics or completely blocked.  The motivation of this research, therefore, was to address these limitations with an integrated GPS/Pseudolite/INS system using ultra-tight integration architecture.  The main research contributions are summarised as below:  (a)	The performance of the tracking loops in dynamic scenarios were analysed in detail with both conventional and ultra-tight software receivers.  The stochastic modelling of the INS-derived Doppler is of utmost importantance in enhancing the benefits of ultra-tight integration, and therefore, two popular stochastic techniques??? Gauss Markov (GM) and Autoregressive (AR), were investigated to model the Doppler signal.  The simulation results demonstrate that the AR method is capable of producing better accuracies and is more efficient.  The algorithms to determine the AR parameters (order and coefficients) were also provided.  (b)	The various mathematical relationships that elicit the understanding of the ultra-tightly integrated system were derived in detail.  The Kalman filter design and its implementation were also provided.  Various simulation and real-time experiments were conducted to study the performance of the filter, and the results confirm the underlying assumptions in the theoretical analyses and the mathematical derivations.  Covariance analysis was also performed to study the convergence and stability effects of the filter.   (c)	Interpolator design using signal processing techniques were proposed to increase the sampling rate of the INS-derived Doppler.  To efficiently realise the interpolator transfer function, two optimal techniques were investigated ??? Polyphase and Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC), and our results show that CIC was more efficient than polyphase in accuracy and real-time implementations.  (d)	 The integration of Pseudolites (PL) with INS in ultra-tight configuration was analysed for an indoor environment.  The acquisition and tracking performances of ???Pseudolites-only??? and ???Pseudolite/INS??? modes were compared to study the impact of the inertial signals aiding.  The results demonstrate that aiding of the inertial signals with the baseband loops (acquisition and tracking) improve the overall tracking performance.  An overview on the effects of the pseudolite signal propagation is also given.  (e)	Simulation and real-time experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms and the overall design of the ultra-tightly integrated system.  A comparison was also done between GPS/PL/INS and GPS/INS integrated systems to study the potential advantages of the pseudolite integration.  The details of the field experiment are provided. The data from a real-time experiment was processed to further evaluate the robustness of the system.  The results confirm that the developed mathematical models and algorithms are correct.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kalman filter</field><field name="subject">GPS, INS, Pseudolites,</field><field name="subject">High dynamics, Receiver tracking loops</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40075</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of rainfall and its importance towards robust catchment simulation, within a hydroinformatic environment</field><field name="creator">Umakhanthan, Kanagaratnam, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rainfall is a natural process, which has a high degree of variability in both space and time. Information on the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall plays an important role in the process of surface runoff generation. Hence it is important for a variety of applications in hydrology and water resources management. The spatial variability of rainfall can be substantial even for very small catchments and an important factor in the reliability of rainfall-runoff simulations. Catchments in urban areas usually are small, and the management problems often require the numerical simulation of catchment processes and hence the need to consider the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall. A need exists, therefore, to analyse the sensitivity of rainfall-runoff behaviour of catchment modelling systems (CMS) to imperfect knowledge of rainfall input, in order to judge whether or not they are reliable and robust, especially if they are to be used for operational purposes. Development of a methodology for identification of storm events according to the degree of heterogeneity in space and time and thence development of a detailed spatial and temporal rainfall model within a hydroinformatic environment utilising real-time data has been the focus of this project. The improvement in runoff prediction accuracy and hence the importance of the rainfall input model in runoff prediction is then demonstrated through the application of a CMS for differing variability of real storm events to catchments with differing orders of scale. The study identified both spatial and temporal semi-variograms, which were produced by plotting the semi-variance of gauge records in space and time against distance and time respectively. These semi-variograms were utilised in introducing estimators to measure the degree of heterogeneity of each individual storm events in their space and time scale. Also, the proposed estimators use ground based gauge records of the real storm events and do not rely on delicate meteorological interpretations. As the results of the investigation on the developed semi-variogram approach, real storm events were categorised as being High Spatial-High Temporal (HS-HT); High Spatial-Low Temporal; (HS-LT); Low Spatial-High Temporal (LS-HT); and Low Spatial-Low Temporal variability.A comparatively detailed rainfall distribution model in space and time was developed within the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The enhanced rainfall representation in both space and time scale is made feasible in the study by the aid of the powerful spatial analytic capability of GIS. The basis of this rainfall model is an extension of the rainfall model developed by Luk and Ball (1998) through a temporal discretisation of the storm event. From this model, improved estimates of the spatially distributed with smaller time steps hyetographs suited for especially the urban catchments could be obtained. The importance of the detailed space-time rainfall model in improving the robustness of runoff prediction of CMS was investigated by comparing error parameters for predictions from CMS using alternate rainfall models, for various degrees of spatiotemporal heterogeneity events. Also it is appropriate to investigate whether the degree of this improvement to be dependent on the variability of the storm event which is assessed by the adopted semi-variogram approach. From the investigations made, it was found that the spline surface rainfall model, which considered the spatial and temporal variability of the rainfall in greater detail than the Thiessen rainfall model resulted in predicted hydrographs that more closely duplicated the recorded hydrograph for the same parameter set. The degree of this improvement in the predicted hydrograph was found to be dependent on the spatial and temporal variability of the storm event as measured by the proposed semi-variogram approach for assessing this feature of a storm event. The analysis is based on forty real events recorded from the Centennial Park Catchment (1.3km2) and the Upper Parramatta River Catchment (110km2) in Sydney, Australia. These two case study catchments were selected to ensure that catchment scale effects were incorporated in the conclusions developed during the study.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Watershed management -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Runoff -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Rain and rainfall -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18668</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of primary/ elementary school music curricula in Australia (NSW), in the UK (England), in the Russian Federation and in the United States of America</field><field name="creator">Petrova, Irina, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">In different countries, the music curricula for primary/ elementary school children has been influenced by many diverse factors including a number of progressive educational practices and a variety of psychological theories. This research gives a detailed analysis of a number of primary/ elementary school programs for general music in Australia (New South Wales, i.e. NSW), in the UK (England), in the Russian Federation and in the United States of America. The research aims to find out to what extent music education in different countries is based on or follows psychological theories of child development and progressive educational practices. Firstly, to acquire an adequate understanding of child education this research examines the philosophical roots of primary/ elementary education and a set of psychological ideas of Piaget and Vigotsky about the nature of children and the nature of knowledge. This provides insight of how children learn (the nature of learning) and the role of the teacher in learning music. Secondly, the research examines the musical content of the syllabae (the nature of subject). It critically compares the following components of curricula and syllabae: philosophy, objectives and contents including musical concepts, activities and music repertoire. This is then subjected to further analysis examining these contents in relation to theories of child development (Piaget and Vigotsky) and traditional and progressive educational practices (where it is applicable). Finally, a questionnaire is aimed at primary school teachers in NSW. These teachers are generalist teachers, there are no specialist music teachers employed as such in public primary schools in NSW. Music is taught in the NSW primary schools by class teachers. The problem is that NSW university faculties of education do not train music teachers as specialists at primary level. They only train generalist teachers. In other countries the situation is different. There are music specialists in the USA, UK and Russia teaching in primary schools. There are also such teachers in primary schools in Queensland, SA, Victoria, and WA and there are some in NSW. The questionnaire was, therefore, designed to enquire into the specific situation in NSW. Finally, issues of further investigation and research of curricula and syllabae in the primary/ elementary school are outlined.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">instruction and study</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time, quasi-temporal change and imaginary numbers</field><field name="creator">Wiszniewski, Witold Roman, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is mainly concerned with the argument for dynamic time. Accepting McTaggart???s proof of the unreality of time, it is argued however, that any description of dynamic time involving static concepts must lead to a contradiction. It is shown that the contradiction arising from this proof is equivalent to the contradiction posed by Aristotle???s definition of change: change is the possession of incompatible properties. A special case of such a change is quasi-temporal change, defined as the possession of incomparable properties at the same time. Furthermore it is claimed that change is a primitive entity. The Block Universe view that three-dimensional dynamic and four-dimensional static representations of the world are equivalent to each other is rejected because of the unknown nature of imaginary numbers describing the time-like dimension of spacetime. It is proposed that the imaginary number i is an mathematical embodiment of change, expressed in the form of quasi-temporal variable: i = [1,-1]. As such i is a scalar variable with two numbers, 1 and ???1, assigned to it. To develop further this idea the Special Theory of Relativity and Hamilton???s theory of the complex numbers are used. It is claimed that the natures of imaginary numbers the time-like dimension are the same. It is shown that this dimension can be given by two opposite displacements of light occurring at the same time. To use Hamilton???s theory a pair of two times is proposed: normal time and dimensional time. The moments of these times are identified with the Hamilton???s primary and secondary moments of time respectively. It is shown that Hamilton???s theory is invariant upon such identification. This allows the extension of the argument forming the theory of the complex numbers. The second theme of the thesis is an argument for multiplicity of times. It is proposed that every being of a natural kind exists in its own time. Individual time is taken as a composition of topologically open time and topologically closed time. Such a composition allows an explanation of the convolution of change and permanence and also formulation of a new interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23401</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A survey of the use of the term vedana (&#8220;sensations&#8221;) in the Pali Nikayas</field><field name="creator">Salkin, Sean</field><field name="description">Master of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pali</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/2075</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structural and cultural dynamics of a multi-campus college : a case study inquiry of four multi-campus colleges in New South Wales</field><field name="creator">"Kivunja, Charles</field><field name="description">This case study of four multi-campus colleges in New South Wales combines both qualitative and quantitative research instruments in a multiple-case study methodology to investigate the reasons why the DET restructured 34 of its comprehensive high schools into 11 multi-campus colleges and to study the interplay of the structural and cultural dynamics in those colleges. The study is situated in the literature on organisational behaviour whose perspective recognises the close interconnectedness between structure and culture but emphasises reculturing as the essence of effective organisational dynamism. In particular, special attention is given to Pace&#8217;s (2002) dynamics model which was redesigned into the Dynamics Paradigm that underpins the data analysis in this thesis. Using 16 structural-cultural dynamics criteria, themes and patterns were identified in the data and through iterative, inductive analysis, they were categorised into the different elements of the Dynamics Paradigm for analysis. Contextual contingency, curriculum, opportunity, economic rationalisation, politics and policies of the DET, plus demonstration effects from other Australian States and Territories were the reasons for the restructuring of the comprehensive high schools.

It adds to the growing literature on the issue of economic integration by throwing the spotlight on several issues hitherto little considered in the existing literature. The thesis especially blends various aspects of economic integration with models of spatial competition, economic geography, regionalisation and globalisation to explain the problems of and prospects for economic integration for the Arab countries. It is important to realise that economic integration has become an important aim for almost all countries in the world; in particular, less developed countries, which need more economic efforts to be able to deal with the current international milieu and the gale of globalisation. The Arab countries have engaged in a number of initiatives to advance economic integration, however despite this the degree of economic integration among them is still relatively insignificant. The thesis also attempts to offer theoretical models to explain the obstacles preventing economic integration in the Arab world. This thesis is, to the best of the author&#8217;s knowledge and belief, the first rigorous study of the extent of and the potential for Arab economic integration through three vital economic perspectives: trade, investment and labour flows. In the first perspective, this study investigates the nature of intra-Arab trade and which particular countries/sub-group of countries may potentially become an integrated regional production system, or hub. This investigation is done within the scope of gravity models, which assume that intra-trade is a function of the GDPs of the involved countries and the distance between them. The thesis extends the literature by introducing spatial models and models of new economic geography to explain how economic integration evolves in the current international milieu concomitantly driven by globalisation and regionalisation. In the second perspective, this study investigates intra-Arab FDI and capital mobility. The postulated model assumes that intra-Arab FDI is a function of a number of economic variables, such as GDP, GDP per capita, inflation and purchasing power parity. The thesis offers a comprehensive theoretical model to explain how successful economic integration can be carried out by FDI flows. In the third perspective, the study investigates intra-Arab labour flows. The proposed model utilises remittances as an indicator of labour flows. It assumes that remittances are a function of some economic variables, such as GDP per capita, the real price of oil, and the oil production of Saudi Arabia, which represents the main Arab host country of Arab labour flows. The proposed theoretical model offers insights into the dynamics of labour flows and oil price movements. The econometric study in the thesis applies panel data for the period 1985-2005, and employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) fixed effects regression. The most important empirical finding of the study is that Arab economic integration has been significantly affected by intra-trade, intra-FDI and intra-labour flows among sub-unions of Arab countries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arab cooperation</field><field name="subject">international economic integration</field><field name="subject">Arab countries</field><field name="subject">foreign economic relations</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38052</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work for all : the Salvation Army and the Job Network</field><field name="creator">Garland, Dennis</field><field name="description">This study explores how one highly institutionalised organisation, namely The Salvation Army engages with policy discourses, how it responds and how it is shaped by its engagement with government. The move from a unified public service to the use of third sector organisations such as The Salvation Army to deliver public services represents a major shift in institutional relationships. This study focuses on the introduction of market discourse throughout the contracting process, in particular how this discourse seeks to reconstruct service users as &#8216;customers&#8217;, and the Salvation Army&#8217;s response to this reconstruction. By exploring the ways in which this religiously and socially motivated non-profit organisation sought to mediate neo-liberal discourses of competition and consumerism, this study seeks to reveal the processes and pressures affecting faith-based and other non-profit organisations which increasingly find themselves acting as agents of government policy under the principles of New Public Management (NPM). The altered relationships brought about by the shift in institutional relationships depend upon new institutional forms to deliver government services, and these new relationships are manifestly displayed in the Job Network. This study focuses on the ways in which The Salvation Army mediates social policy within this new institutional relationship. The changing relationship between government and The Salvation Army, as manifested in the development and implementation of employment policy in Australia between 1998 to 2007 is explored in this study. Neo-institutional theory provides the theoretical framework of this study. Neoinstitutional theory addresses the impact of shifts in the relationships between government and third sector organisations such as The Salvation Army via contracting out of government employment services. This changing relationship between government and The Salvation Army, as played out in the specific institutional field of the employment service through the creation of the Job Network is explored in this study. Within a constructionist approach, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is deployed as the analytical technology. This study uses textual material as its main source of primary data, including extracts from job network contracts, internal and public Salvation Army documents, and utterances by government. The study explores the ways in which The Salvation Army has attempted to mediate social policy and the organisational tensions that arise as the Army seeks to maintain organizational independence. This study reveals that though government as the creator of the new quasi-market and purchaser of services in that market is perhaps the most powerful actor, the new institutional relationships are not completely a master/servant relationship; third sector organisations such as The Salvation Army do have the capacity to influence government. Additionally, this study calls into question the notions that the third sector and the government sector are differentiated realms and suggests that new paradigms should be developed to explore the institutional relationships that are now developing in the provision of welfare services in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salvation Army</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">nonprofit organizations</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">Job Network (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38093</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hooked on humour : achieving rapport in humorous interactions between men and women who are friends</field><field name="creator">Candita, Linda A.</field><field name="description">Based on analyses of recorded real-life social interactions among English men and women friends living in England, this study shows how crucial it is to use a range of communication behaviours to express humour and maintain rapport. Men and women are keen to learn how to improve and preserve their social relationships (Mulac, Bradac and Gibbons, 2001). However, the immense literature on human communication ignores the multifaceted and positive force of humour in the social interactions of friends (Lynch, 2002). In addition, there is an absence of firm theoretical principles on which to develop counselling sessions and teach individuals to develop humour skills. Therefore, this study examines how participants incorporate humour in their ongoing conversation to achieve rapport in face-to-face social interaction in mixed-gender groups. This investigation is situated within the fields of human communication and humour and gender research. The necessarily communicative approach involved qualitative data collection and description, namely conversation analysis (CA) and ethnography, complemented by quantitative analysis. Communication context, that is, interactants&#8217; attitudes and personality, their history, background knowledge, and how they relate to each other, are shown to play an important role in preserving friendships and maintaining rapport. Light is thrown on specific behaviours that could help men and women nurture their friendships and it is explained why there is a need for individuals to view humour as a positive force in their communication with one another. It is argued that misunderstandings may arise if men and women do not understand the way each gender uses humour. Thus, men and women could empower themselves by objectively examining how they interact, challenge the perceptions each may have about their own communication, and gain a more thorough understanding of verbal and non-verbal strategies for facilitating humour. By harmonising their verbal and non-verbal behaviours, men and women can use humour not only to express affiliation and commonality but also as a strategy for testing the boundaries of gender in a non-threatening way, to minimise differences, and to discover more about the opposite gender. In time and with further academic inquiry, humour could be acknowledged as a critical communication tool for establishing and sustaining relationships. The hope is that this study could be a catalyst for future research on promoting humour as a key element of daily social interaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">men</field><field name="subject">interpersonal relations</field><field name="subject">sex role</field><field name="subject">humor</field><field name="subject">friendship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38155</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE AVATAR IN PANAMA: 
MODERN AND POSTMODERN DOUBLES AND DOUBLING IN ENRIQUE JARAMILLO LEVI&#146;S WORLD OF DUPLICACIONES</field><field name="creator">MacLeod, Denise</field><field name="description">The concept of the double in literature has long enjoyed controversy. Originally, its purpose was to function purely as a comic device or to create an atmosphere conducive to the theme of mistaken identity. As the artistic and social milieu changed, the double came to embody unconscious desire in the form of a projected second self. Although its popularity as a theme seems to have waned in recent times, the double has re-emerged with a new twist as it has moved into the realm of postmodernism. Panamanian writer, Enrique Jaramillo Levi, has become synonymous with the concept although to date the theme has not been researched at all in its application to his work. This thesis deals with the treatment of this literary device in the work of Jaramillo Levi from a modern and postmodern perspective by using representative writers from around the world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">doubles</field><field name="subject">doubling</field><field name="subject">doppelganger</field><field name="subject">Panamanian Literature</field><field name="subject">Enrique Jaramillo Levi</field><field name="subject">Duplicaciones</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20090527.161343</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional assessment of the role of cyclic nucleotide-gates channel (CNGC10) and salt overly sensitive (SOS1) antiporter in salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis</field><field name="creator">Guo, Kunmei</field><field name="description">Control of intracellular ion homeostasis is pivotal to plant salt tolerance. Plants have developed a number of mechanisms to keep ions at appropriate concentrations. Both transporters and channels on the plasma membrane play important roles in this function. Plant cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) in the plasma membrane are non-selective monovalent and divalent cation channels. So far, most studies on plant CNGCs have been conducted on heterologous systems. In planta, reverse genetic studies revealed the role of different CNGCs in cation uptake, transport and homeostasis. However, there is little information available about the functional characteristics of plant CNGCs. Among the 20 members of this protein family in Arabidopsis, only AtCNGC2 has been functionally identified as an ion channel; therefore, more functional characterization needs to be done on other members of this protein family. Several CNGCs were suggested to be involved in K+, Ca2+ and Na+ uptake and transport, but available information is scarce. This study investigated the relationship between CNGC10 and ion transport in Arabidopsis, with a particular emphasis on the involvement of CNGC10 in salt tolerance. Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) and two AtCNGC10 antisense lines (A2 and A3) were used to characterise the impact of different level of salt stress on (i) root growth, ion concentration in tissues, ion fluxes across the root surface and intracellular ion concentration and pH at the seedling stage, and (ii) photosynthesis and ion concentration in tissues at the flowering stage. Plants of both antisense lines had higher K+ and lower Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in shoots than WT plants when grown in non-salt control 1/4 Hoagland solution. Altered K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ internal concentrations in AtCNGC10 antisense lines compared with WT plants under non-salt conditions indicated disturbed long distance ion transport, especially xylem loading/retrieval and/or phloem loading. The results of ion fluxes across the root surface also suggested that AtCNGC10 might be involved in transport of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in tissue. Under sudden salt exposure, higher Na+ efflux and smaller K+ efflux in both antisense lines suggested that AtCNGC10 channels are involved in Na+ and K+ transport. The shoots of AtCNGC10 antisense lines A2 and A3 contained higher Na+ concentrations and significantly higher Na+/K+ ratios compared to WT, resulting in impaired photosynthesis and increased salt sensitivity in A2 and A3 than in WT plants. In contrast, seedlings of both antisense lines exposed to salt stress had lower shoot Na+/K+ ratios and longer roots than WT seedlings, indicating that A2 and A3 were more salt-tolerant than WT in the seedling stage, likely because growth is less dependent on photosynthesis in the seedling than in the flowering stage. These results suggested CNGC gene might play a different role during different developmental stages and in various plant organs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arabidopsis -- Effect of salt on</field><field name="subject">Germination -- Effect of salt on</field><field name="subject">Ion channels</field><field name="subject">Nucleotides</field><field name="subject">Seedlings -- Growth -- Effect of salt on</field><field name="subject">Salt resistance</field><field name="subject">CNGC</field><field name="subject">SOS1</field><field name="subject">Ion flux</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0063</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-Domain Content-Based Retrieval of Audio Music through Transcription</field><field name="creator">Suyoto, Iman S. H.</field><field name="description">Research in the field of music information retrieval (MIR) is concerned with methods to effectively retrieve a piece of music based on a user's query. An important goal in MIR research is the ability to successfully retrieve music stored as recorded audio using note-based queries.      In this work, we consider the searching of musical audio using symbolic queries. We first examined the effectiveness of using a relative pitch approach to represent queries and pieces. Our experimental results revealed that this technique, while effective, is optimal when the whole tune is used as a query. We then suggested an algorithm involving the use of pitch classes in conjunction with the longest common subsequence algorithm between a query and target, also using the whole tune as a query. We also proposed an algorithm that works effectively when only a small part of a tune is used as a query. The algorithm makes use of a sliding window in addition to pitch classes and the longest common subsequence algorithm between a query and target. We examined the algorithm using queries based on the beginning, middle, and ending parts of pieces.      We performed experiments on an audio collection and manually-constructed symbolic queries. Our experimental evaluation revealed that our techniques are highly effective, with most queries used in our experiments being able to retrieve a correct answer in the first rank position.      In addition, we examined the effectiveness of duration-based features for improving retrieval effectiveness over the use of pitch only. We investigated note durations and inter-onset intervals. For this purpose, we used solely symbolic music so that we could focus on the core of the problem. A relative pitch approach alongside a relative duration representation were used in our experiments. Our experimental results showed that durations fail to significantly improve retrieval effectiveness, whereas inter-onset intervals significantly improve retrieval effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">information retrieval</field><field name="subject">audio</field><field name="subject">symbolic</field><field name="subject">signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090527.092841</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buddhist Perspectives on Sustainability: Towards Radical Transformation of Self and World</field><field name="creator">TSuwan, Chaiyatorn</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the contribution of Buddhism to sustainability. It explores the impacts of Buddhism on the lives of nine individuals and the implications of these impacts for a sustainable world. This thesis regards sustainability as the most pressing issue at this junction in human history. It believes that the shift to sustainability requires profound individual and social transformations throughout the world and that such transformations necessitate the involvement of the spiritual traditions of the world. As one such tradition, Buddhism has the ability to impart principles and practices that have been applied in daily living for over 2,500 years to contemporary sustainability discourse.       The modern idea of sustainability first became prominent in the international arena in 1980s when the Brundtland Commission enunciated its vision of the path to sustainability and referred to it as 'sustainable development'. However, this thesis contends that the concept of sustainable development was flawed from the beginning because it was founded on the idea of perpetual economic growth as the solution to environmental and social problems. Instead, the thesis forwards a holistic, systems approach to sustainability that regards human well-being as the ultimate goal. It adopts two theoretical conceptions of sustainability developed by Donella Meadows - the pyramidal framework for sustainability and the scheme of leverage points - as tools to analyse the contribution of Buddhism to sustainability.      This thesis examines the literature on Buddhism and sustainability. It finds that Buddhism espouses many ecological and social values conducive to a sustainable philosophy of life. In addition, Buddhist economics has experienced rich theoretical developments in recent years and provides an alternative to mainstream economics based on growth. Buddhist economics has helped propel two Buddhist developmental paradigms - Bhutan's Gross National Happiness and Thailand's Sufficiency Economy - to the forefront of national agendas in their respective countries, thus demonstrating the renaissance of the application of Buddhist thinking in society. At the micro level, many communities around the world are attempting to translate the most fundamental principles of Buddhism into ways for harmonious living and in an attempt to combat the tide of environmental and social degradation. Thus, Buddhism is making an impact on sustainability at many levels around the world. However, this thesis finds little empirical evidence to  demonstrate the effect of Buddhism on forms of personal transformation that leads to sustainable behaviour. This is despite the importance of the idea of transformation and personal growth in Buddhism. This empirical void leads to the aim of the thesis, which is to explore the ways in which the beliefs, practices and transformational tools within Buddhism can contribute to living sustainably.      To achieve this aim, the methodology of mindful inquiry was employed. Mindful inquiry is a methodological union of East and West and integrates four perspectives: critical theory, hermeneutics, phenomenology and Buddhism. It is appropriate for a values-based research such as this one where the orientation of the researcher is critical to the outcome of the research. A method consistent with mindful inquiry is the basic interpretive qualitative study. The basic interpretive qualitative study used in this study combines elements from ethnography, case study, phenomenology and critical research. It was used to explore the lifeworlds of nine Buddhist participants in order to understand the impact of Buddhism on their lives. The major data gathering technique was in-depth interviews although participant observation and document collection were also used. Analysis of data proceeded through the constant comparative method.      The findings from this thesis are divided into three themes. Firstly, the idea of personal sustainability is forwarded as a concept to help understand the impact of Buddhism. Personal sustainability concerns the psychological 'integratedness' of individuals to enable the achievement of higher levels of well-being. The findings suggest that Buddhism has significantly enhanced the personal sustainability level of all nine participants. Secondly, Meadows' ideas of paradigm shift and paradigm transcendence are explored. The findings suggest that paradigm shifts or paradigm transcendence have occurred among the participants through the adoption of Buddhist principles and meditative practices. Thirdly, the notions of happiness and purpose in life are investigated. The findings highlight radical changes in the participants' understandings of these notions and the nature of these understandings that are significantly different from conventional views.      As a result of these findings, the thesis argues that the contribution of Buddhism to sustainability can be considerable because Buddhism contributes to the protection of natural capital, the enrichment of social and human capitals, and a deepened understanding of well-being, which is divorced from simplistic ideas such as material accumulation and sensual gratification. The thesis concludes by highlighting the potentials of Buddhism to instigate profound personal and social transformations that could lead to a sustainable world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Buddhism</field><field name="subject">Personal Spiritual Transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090527.095110</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of Hypericum perforatum with Vitex agnus-catus in the treatment of menopausal symptoms</field><field name="creator">van Die, Margaret Diana</field><field name="description">Background:	Interest in alternatives to hormone therapy (HT) for menopausal symptoms increased following its association with serious health risks.  In terms of phytotherapeutic interventions, while traditional use supports a range of herbs for treating menopausal symptoms, evidence from rigorous scientific trials is limited, and has largely focused on the phytoestrogenic plants.  Because of some safety concerns over long-term use of isoflavones, the present study focused on two non-estrogenic herbs, Hypericum perforatum and Vitex agnus-castus, also employed in this context in the Anglo-American and European traditions.      Both herbs have shown effectiveness for the alleviation of symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which is reported to be more severe during the perimenopause, and may account for many of the so-called 'menopausal symptoms' at this time.     Research on menopausal vasomotor symptoms is prone to substantial placebo responses. There has been much interest in increasing our understanding of the placebo response with a view to controlling it in clinical research and harnessing it in clinical practice.     Methods &amp; Results:	A double-blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT), with a 16-week treatment phase, was conducted on 100 late-perimenopause and early postmenopause women.  The herbal combination (Hypericum and Vitex) was not found to be superior to placebo for any of the endpoints - daily weighted flushing scores, overall menopausal symptoms (on the Greene Climacteric Scale) and depression (on the Hamilton Depression Inventory). However, significant improvements across the treatment phase were observed in both arms for all of these outcome measures. No significant change was found for either group on the Utian quality of life scale.     The effects of the herbal combination were also examined on PMS-like symptoms in the small sub-population of late-perimenopausal women, and found to be superior to placebo for total PMS-like symptoms and the sub-clusters, PMS-D (depression) and PMS-C (cravings).  The active treatment group also showed significant improvements on PMS-A (anxiety) and PMS-H (hydration), although these effects were not superior to placebo.     Predictors of the placebo response were investigated and found to include study-entry anxiety for the outcome measures of flushing, depression and overall menopausal symptoms, and improvement during non-treatment run-in for depression and overall symptoms.  Because no difference had been found between 'active' and placebo groups in the menopause RCT, it was hypothesised that the same predictors would predict the response to the study treatment.  However, low anxiety was significantly associated with improvement in this group.  None of the other variables that predicted the placebo response was relevant to the study treatment response.  This finding is discussed with reference to the possibility that 'drug' effects and placebo effects are not necessarily additive, and that the same magnitude of effect in both arms might not necessarily imply activity via the same pathways.      Conclusions:	This research contributes to the growing body of scientific knowledge about evidence-based complementary therapies that informs the community, health-care providers and regulatory authorities.    The findings may facilitate identification of potential placebo responders in future research.  The need for more research in the area of mechanisms of placebo versus active responses is supported.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Menopause</field><field name="subject">Hot flushes</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="subject">Complementary medicine</field><field name="subject">Phytotherapy</field><field name="subject">Herbal Medicine</field><field name="subject">Hypericum peforatum</field><field name="subject">Vitex agnus-castus</field><field name="subject">Women's Health</field><field name="subject">Clinical trials</field><field name="subject">RCT</field><field name="subject">PMS</field><field name="subject">Placebo response</field><field name="subject">Predictors</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090527.101507</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capacitive Array Resistivity with an Inductive Source</field><field name="creator">Adams, Christopher Hugh</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to develop an instrument that fills a niche in geophysical instrumentation for a tool that is fast, non-contact or minimal contact, and specifically optimised for discrete, near-surface, electrically resistive targets in resistive and conductive environments.  This aim was sought to be achieved through the development of a new Capacitive Array Resistivity with Inductive Source (CARIS) system.      Two CARIS systems were produced and thoroughly tested.  A first prototype instrument CARIS-1, operating at 100KHz, was developed for proof of concept in the laboratory and initial field testing.  A second prototype CARIS-2, operating at 5kHz, was developed for further fielding testing and trial mapping experiments.      Several major conclusions have been reached through the development and testing of the CARIS systems.  Firstly, the CARIS system can clearly detect objects in a conductive homogeneous liquid, with high repeatability of data.  This result reinforced the concept of the CARIS method, and established the stability of the instrumentation in laboratory environments.  The approach was validated by close correlation between measurements and modelling.  Secondly, the CARIS system is able to measure responses to near-surface conductivity variation in field conditions with high repeatability. Data collected also showed spatial consistency with GPR, Resistivity and mapped culture.   It was determined that properties of the near surface, such as moisture content and soil consolidation, can significantly affect the electrical homogeneity of the medium and thus the uniformity of the background reading. The CARIS systems thus had a limitation that they proved to be quite sensitive to variations of this nature. Thirdly, foll owing from the second conclusion, although the aim of the CARIS system was to detect the presence of discrete buried objects, CARIS proved to be more responsive to the effects of the burial process rather than the objects themselves.  It was concluded therefore that the method of excavation, burial, and refill material were of high significance in CARIS interpretation.  This conclusion was reinforced by the results of theoretical modelling which showed that shallow boundaries of small conductivity contrast could quite easily produce more significant anomalies than target objects which are deeper and have higher contrast.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">capacitive</field><field name="subject">resistivity</field><field name="subject">inductive source</field><field name="subject">non-contact</field><field name="subject">electric field</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090527.142304</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Great re-freezing?

The thesis broadened its scope with inclusion of non-ornithorhynchid Mesozoic monotremes from Lightning Ridge, NSW. This change in direction brought an unexpected result: a fossil mammal from Lightning Ridge investigated for this thesis (presumed to be monotreme: Flannery et al., 1995) appears to be a new and unique type of mammal. Specimens were procured through Queensland Museum (Riversleigh material); Australian Museum (Lightning Ridge material); and Museum of Victoria and the South Australian Museum (fossil ornithorhynchids). Specimens were examined under a light microscope and scanning electron microscope; specimens were photographed using light photography and a scanning electron microscope; and illustrations and reconstructions were done with a camera lucida microscope attachment and photographic references. Parsimony analysis utilised the computer programs PAUP and MacClade. Major conclusions: 1) analysis and reconstruction of the skull of the Miocene platypus Obdurodon dicksoni suggest this robust, large-billed platypus was a derived northern offshoot off the main line of ornithorhynchid evolution; 2) the well-preserved skull of Obdurodon dicksoni shows aspects of soft anatomy previously unknown for fossil ornithorhynchids; 3) two upper molars from Mammalon Hill (Etadunna Formation, late Oligocene, central Australia) represent a third species of Obdurodon; 4) the South American ornithorhynchid Monotrematum sudamericanum from the Paleocene of Argentina is very close in form to the Oligocene-Miocene Obdurodon species from Australia and should be considered congeneric; 5) a revised diagnosis of the lower jaw of the Early Cretaceous monotreme Steropodon galmani includes the presence of two previously undescribed archaic features: the probable presence of postdentary bones and a meckelian groove; 6) morphological evidence is presented supporting a separate family Steropodontidae; and 7) analysis of new fossil material for Kollikodon ritchiei suggests that this taxon is not a monotreme mammal as originally identified but is a basal mammal with close relationships to allotherian mammals (Morganucodonta; Haramiyida). Kollikodon is provisionally placed as basal allotherian mammal (Allotheria sensu Butler 2000) and is unique at the ordinal level, being neither haramiyid nor multituberculate.

The thermo-elastic-plastic constitutive equations for stress-strain relations of the solid skeleton and changes in fluid content and entropy for unsaturated soils have been established. A plasticity model is derived from energy considerations. The model derived covers both associative and non-associative flow behaviours and the modified Cam-Clay is considered as a special case. All model coefficients are identified in terms of measurable parameters. To verify the proposed model, an experimental program has been developed. A series of controlled laboratory tests were carried out on a compacted silt sample using a triaxial equipment modified for testing unsaturated soils at elevated temperatures. Imageprocessing technique was used for measuring the volume change of the samples subjected to mechanical, thermal and hydric loading. It is shown that the effective critical state parameters M, ???? and ???? are independent of temperature and matric suction. Nevertheless, the shape of loading collapse (LC) curve was affected by temperature and suction. Furthermore, the temperature change affected the soil water characteristic curve and an increase in temperature caused a decrease in the air entry suction. The simulations from the proposed model are compared with the experimental results. The model calibration was performed to extract the model parameters from the experimental results. Good agreement between the results predicted using the proposed model and the experimental results was obtained in all cases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil moisture</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Models</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Soil structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Soil heating</field><field name="subject">Soils</field><field name="subject">Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">unsaturated soils</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22068</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art of place and displacement: embodied perception and the haptic ground</field><field name="creator">King, Victoria, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between art and place, and challenges conventional readings of the paintings of the late Aboriginal Anmatyerr elder Emily Kame Kngwarray of Australia and Canadian/American modernist artist Agnes Martin. In the case of Kngwarray, connections between body, ground and canvas are extensively explored through stories told to the author by Emily???s countrywomen at Utopia in the Northern Territory. In the case of Agnes Martin, these relationships are explored through personal interview with the artist in Taos, New Mexico, and by phenomenological readings of her paintings. The methodology is based on analysis of narrative, interview material, existing critical literature and the artists??? paintings. The haptic and embodiment emerge as strong themes, but the artists??? use of repetition provides fertile ground to question wholly aesthetic or cultural readings of their paintings. The thesis demonstrates the significance of historical and psychological denial and erasure, as well as transgenerational legacies in the artists??? work. A close examination is made of the artists??? use of surface shimmer in their paintings and the effects of it on the beholder. The implications of being mesmerized by shimmer, especially in the case of Aboriginal paintings, bring up ethical questions about cultural difference and the shadow side of art in its capacity for complicity, denial, appropriation and commodification. This thesis challenges the ocularcentric tradition of seeing the land and art, and examines what occurs when a painting is viewed on the walls of a gallery. It addresses Eurocentric readings of Aboriginal art and looks at the power of the aesthetic gaze that eliminates cultural difference. Differences between space and place are explored through an investigation of the phenomenology of perception, the haptic, embodiment and ???presentness???. Place affiliation and the effects of displacement are examined to discover what is often taken for granted: the ground beneath our feet. Art can express belonging and relationship with far-reaching cultural, political, psychological and environmental implications, but only if denial and loss of place are acknowledged.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22495</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stress and GABAA receptor regulation</field><field name="creator">Skilbeck, Kelly Johanne</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GABAA receptor</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">sex differences</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence</field><field name="subject">quantitative receptor autoradiography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4997</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cannabinoid and neuregulin 1 gene interaction as an animal model of increased vulnerability to schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Boucher, Aurelie Alexandra</field><field name="description">Doctor of Phylosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cannabinoid</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">neuregulin</field><field name="subject">lateral septum</field><field name="subject">mice behaviour</field><field name="subject">stress</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4998</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preparation, optimisation and characterisation of sequence selective compounds</field><field name="creator">Taleb, Robin I.</field><field name="description">DNA is the pharmacological target for most platinum drugs; however, the majority of these drugs show little or no specificity for particular base pairs. Considerable progress has been made in the design of sequence selective compounds, such that an antiparallel association of a polyamide can have high affinity for selected DNA base pairs. Hairpin polyamides have distinct advantages as they achieve affinities and specificities that are comparable to that of DNA-binding proteins. Platinum(II) hairpin polyamides are expected to display antitumour activity and target specific sequences of DNA. Five DNA-sequence-selective hairpin polyamide platinum(II) complexes, containing pyrrole (Py) and imidazole (Im) heterocyclic rings, have been synthesised using a combination of solid and solution phase chemistry. One mononuclear sequence selective complex, &#946;-Ala-PyPyPy-L4-ImImIm-L4-Pt (HLSP-6) [&#946;-Ala is &#946;-alanine, L4 is 4-(Fmoc-amino)butyric acid and Pt is transplatin], and two dinuclear sequence selective complexes, &#946;-Ala-PyPyPy-L4-ImImIm-L6'-Pt-(Pt) (DNHLSP-6) [L6' is 2,6-Fmoc-Lysine-(Fmoc)-OH] and &#946;-Ala-PyPyImImIm-L4'-PyPyPyPyPy-L6'-Pt-(Pt) (DNHLSP-10) (L4' is 2-Boc-4-Fmoc-L-diaminobutyric acid), were synthesised entirely using solid phase chemistry. Two mononuclear sequence selective complexes, Pt-L6-&#946;-Ala-Py-L4-Im (HSP-2) and Pt-L6-&#946;-Ala-PyPyPy-L4-ImImIm (HSP-6), were synthesised using a combination of solid and solution phase chemistry. The synthesis of a trinuclear sequence selective polyamide was also attempted using a combination of solid and solution phase chemistry. The polyamides were synthesised in a series of reaction steps. Each heterocyclic ring and linker was coupled through solid phase chemistry using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-y1)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). Once the organic components were assembled, the platinum(II) group/s was/were added using either solid or solution phase chemistry. The polyamide sequence of PyPyPy-L4-ImImIm was designed to target the guanine rich telomere region of DNA. The metal complexes reported in this study will span sequences between 2, 5 or 7 DNA base pairs (depending on their length), which include 5'-(A/T)GGG(A/T)-3' and 5'-(A/T)(A/T)(A/T)GGG(A/T)-3'. All complexes were characterised using 1H and 195Pt NMR, high resolution mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The binding of HLSP-6 and DNHLSP-6 to guanosine was also monitored by 1H NMR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">drugs</field><field name="subject">polyamides</field><field name="subject">genetic code</field><field name="subject">molecular biology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38214</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of honeybee foraging activity and pollination efficacy in Australian Bt cotton</field><field name="creator">Keshlaf, Marwan M.</field><field name="description">Cotton is a high-value commercial crop in Australia. Although cotton is largely self-pollinating, previous researchers have reported that honeybees, Apis mellifera, can assist in cross-pollination and contribute to improved yield. Until recently, use of bees in cotton had, however, been greatly limited by excessive use of pesticides to control arthropod pests. With the widespread use of transgenic (Bt) cotton varieties and the associated reduction in pesticide use, I decided to investigate the role and importance of honeybees in Bt cotton, under Australian conditions. I conducted two major field trials at Narrabri, in the centre of one of Australia&#8217;s major cotton-growing areas, in the 2005-6 and 2006-7 seasons. In the first trial, I particularly assessed methods of manipulating honeybee colonies by feeding pollen supplements of pollen/soybean patties, and by restricting pollen influx by the fitting of 30% efficient pollen traps. I aimed to test whether either of these strategies increased honeybee flight activity and, thus, increased foraging on cotton flowers. My results showed that although supplementary feeding increased bee flight activity and brood production, it did not increase pollen collection on cotton. Pollen traps initially reduced flight activity. They also reduced the amount of pollen stored in colonies, slowed down brood rearing activity, and honey production. However, they did not contribute to increased pollen collection in cotton. In the second trial, I spent more time investigating honeybee behaviour in cotton as well as assessing the effect of providing flowering cotton plants with access to honeybees for different time periods (e.g. 25 d, 15 d, 0 d). In this year, I used double the hive stocking rate of (16 colonies / ha) than in the previous year, because in 2005-6 I observed few bees in cotton flowers. I also conducted a preliminary investigation to assess whether there was any gene flow over a 16 m distance from Bt cotton to conventional cotton, in the presence of a relatively high honeybee population. Both of my field experiments showed that honeybees significantly increased cotton yield via increased boll set, mean weight of bolls, number of seeds / boll, and weight of lint / boll. It was obvious that cotton flowers, and particularly cotton pollen, were not attractive to honeybees, and this was also reflected in the low proportion (5.3% w/w) of pollen from cotton collected in the pollen traps. However, flower visitation rate was generally above the 0.5% level regarded as optimal for cross-pollination in cotton, and this was reflected in increased yield parameters. I recorded a gene flow of 1.7 % from Bollgard&#174;II cotton to conventional cotton, over a distance of 16 m. This is much higher than had previously been reported for Australia, and may have been a result of high honeybee numbers in the vicinity, associated with my managed hives. In an attempt to attract more honeybees to cotton flowers, I conducted an investigation where I applied synthetic Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP) (Fruit Boost&#174;) at two rates, 50 QEQ and 500 QEQ / ha, and for two applications, 2 d apart. Neither rate of QMP increased the level of bee visitation to flowers, either on the day of application or the subsequent day. There was also no increase in boll set or yield in plants treated with QMP. My observations of honeybee behaviour in cotton brought some interesting findings. First, honeybees totally ignored extra floral nectaries. Second, most flower-visiting honeybees collected nectar, but the overwhelming majority of them (84%) collected floral nectar from outside flowers: this meant these bees did not contribute to pollination. Those nectar gatherers which entered flowers did contribute to pollination. However, they were observed to exhibit rejection of cotton pollen by scraping pollen grains from their body and discarding them, prior to returning to their hives. Pollen gatherers collected only small, loose pellets from cotton. SEM studies showed that cotton pollen grains were the largest of all pollen commonly collected by bees in my investigations, and that they also had large spines. It is likely that these characteristics make cotton pollen unattractive to honeybees. Another possible reason for the unattractiveness of cotton flowers was the presence of pollen beetles, Carpophilus aterrimus, in them. I conducted a series of studies to determine the role of pollen beetles in pollination of cotton. I found that they did not contribute to pollination at low levels; at high populations they damaged flowers (with &#8805; 10 beetles / flower, no flowers set bolls); and that honeybees, when given the choice, avoid flowers with pollen beetles. Because the insecticide fipronil was commonly used in Australian cotton at flowering time, and because I had some experience of its toxic effects against honeybees in my field investigations, I conducted a series of laboratory and potted plant bioassays, using young worker bees. The studies confirmed its highly toxic nature. I recorded an acute dermal LD50 of 1.9 ng / bee, and an acute oral LC50 of 0.62 ppm. Fipronil&#8217;s residual toxicity also remained high for an extended period in both laboratory and potted plant trials. For example, when applied to cotton leaves in weather-exposed potted cotton plants, it took 25 d and 20 d for full and half recommended rates of fipronil, respectively, to become non- toxic to honeybees. I had previously investigated whether a shorter period of exposure of cotton plants to honeybees would contribute adequately to increased yield, and concluded that a 10 d window within a 25 d flowering period would contribute 55% of the increase in total weight of bolls contributable to honeybee pollination, but only 36% of the increase in weight of lint. Given the highly residual activity of fipronil I recorded, the only opportunity for an insecticide-free period during flowering would be at its commencement. I concluded that, while there is evidence that honeybees can contribute to increased cotton yield in Bt cotton in Australia, this is unlikely with the continued use of fipronil at flowering.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pollination by insects</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">honeybee</field><field name="subject">cotton growing</field><field name="subject">bee culture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38265</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Customer comfort as a marketing construct in healthcare</field><field name="creator">Medabesh, Ali Mohemmed M</field><field name="description">Customer comfort is an important factor in developing and maintaining relationships between customers and service providers. For example, it plays essential roles in selecting service provider. In spite of its importance, the concept of comfort has not been fully explained in the service marketing literature. Although, comfort has been discussed as a fundamental element in healthcare, its role in developing and maintaining customer relationships has not been fully explored in the boarder marketing literature. The present study focuses on the concept of comfort (physical and psychological) as a crucial factor in marketing health care services, particularly in Saudi private hospitals This thesis examines a number of the antecedents and consequences of physical and psychological aspects of comfort in the marketing arena. Antecedents investigated included: functional and technical dimensions of service quality, the environmental and social aspects of hospital life and service costs (monetary and non-monetary). Patients&#146; satisfaction was the consequence of customer comfort explored in this thesis. When the relationships between the physical and psychological aspects of comfort and their antecedents were examined, it was concluded that a number of these constructs were shown to have positive effects in the concept of comfort in Saudi private hospitals. For example, the construct of functional service quality appears to have a positive effect in the perception of psychological comfort. The construct of technical service quality, such as staff behaviours, also tends to have a positive effect in the perception of psychological comfort. The social and environmental aspects of hospital life stood out as the only construct that has a positive effect in the perception of physical comfort. While the monetary and non-monetary costs of the service were VII found to have no effect in the perceptions of both physical and psychological comfort. In testing the consequence of the physical and psychological aspects of comfort, it was found that psychological comfort tends to have a positive effect in satisfaction. Finally, the findings showed that the technical dimension of service quality appears to have significant effects in the perceptions of both psychological comfort and satisfaction. This implies that the technical dimension of service quality tends to promote psychological comfort and satisfaction for Saudi patients. The perception of physical and psychological comfort in Saudi private hospitals is also influenced by the roles of the Islamic religion which is based on the holy Quran and Sunnah of Profit Mohammed (peace be upon Him). In addition to the basic dimensions of comfort, these roles can be used to shape the perceptions of the concept of comfort. It may be useful for Saudi private hospitals to direct their efforts towards promoting patients&#146; comfort and satisfaction by providing healthcare quality experience that focuses on the functional and technical dimensions of healthcare services, the environmental and social aspects of hospitals and the costs of their services. Data has been collected using an established questionnaire to examine the relationship between comfort, service quality, hospital life and costs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Customer relations -- Saudi Arabia</field><field name="subject">Hospitals -- Saudi Arabia</field><field name="subject">Medical care -- Saudi Arabia</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Customer comfort</field><field name="subject">Marketing construct in healthcare</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0068</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Partnerships : an opportunity to restore meaning to the 'human' in human services</field><field name="creator">Harkness, Christopher</field><field name="description">This research study is about partnership working in the human services using community mental health as a context. The purpose of this type of research has relevance today as governments at all levels in Australia are adopting partnerships as social policy tools to address social problems. The rationale for these policies appears to be based on recognition that large social problems require holistic responses through the working together of multiple agencies. However despite the volumes of material about the programmatic means for enacting partnerships I found little which attended to the micro practices of partnership. The lack of guidelines on how to engage in partnership becomes problematic as partnerships in social service contexts have complexities and can be difficult to enact. Moreover actors may feel undermined when it is taken for granted that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to enact partnerships. A case study is conducted on how partnerships are enacted within Bethany Outreach Services, a pseudonym used to represent a psychosocial support service in the Perth metropolitan area. Semi-structured in-depth interviews are conducted with seven participants engaged in a partnership within community mental health. The literature is analysed for its contribution to the critical question of how to &#147;do&#148; partnership. Case examples are utilised to contextualise key principles of partnership. Key elements of theoretical perspectives are applied as a way to better understand how partnerships might work better. Narratives from the literature and the experiences of people as seen through this case study are examined to arrive at some key elements of partnership. Despite their complexities partnerships provide an opportunity for actors to engage their humanity and build relationships based on human qualities such as respect, communication and the sharing of resources. These qualities build social capital, which can be developed in new partnership contexts to address new problem domains. It is through these qualities that partnerships might give meaning to the 'Human' in Human Services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human services -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Public welfare -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Public-private sector cooperation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Social service -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Partnerships - a case study</field><field name="subject">Partnerships - social services</field><field name="subject">Key elements of partnerships</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal in partnerships</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0069</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disinfection by-products and public health concerns</field><field name="creator">McAuley, Kimberley</field><field name="description">Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are a major group of water contaminants and their role in causing adverse health outcomes, including adverse pregnancy outcomes, endocrine disruption, respiratory related adverse health outcomes and cancer has been subject to extensive epidemiological and toxicological research and review. Determination of safe exposure to DBPs, particularly within drinking water supplies, has been a topic of extensive debate, with a wide range of acceptable levels set across the industrialized world. The focus of the research in this thesis was on two of the main health outcomes associated with DBP exposure, namely adverse pregnancy outcomes and asthma related symptoms. To assess adverse pregnancy outcomes in Perth, an extensive classification quantification of the major DBPs in Perth drinking water was conducted. A registrybased prevalence study was carried out to assess birth defects in relation to high, medium and low DBP areas (defined by the water sampling and analysis). It was found that women living in high THM areas are 22% (odds ratio (OR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01-1.48) more likely of having a baby with any birth defect. High exposure was also strongly associated with an increased risk of having a baby with a cardiovascular defect (62% increased risk). Low birth weight and prematurity were also assessed; however these outcomes were not associated with an increased risk through an increase in exposure. Following on from this analysis, a population risk assessment model was developed for DBPs in high exposure environments. This involved a three step process: (i) Firstly a questionnaire-based validation and reliability study was used to assess water consumption patterns of a population of pregnant women in Perth. (ii) Secondly a prediction model for teratogenic burden of DBPs in Perth was developed, related to the exposure patterns of the population of pregnant women involved in the validation and reliability study. (iii) Finally, combining the information collected in (i) and (ii), along with the regression slope estimates for birth weight from the prevalence study (defined in Section 2.2.1), a dose-response model for THMs and birth weight was developed. Predictive simulations for birth weights at given THM levels were then conducted. It was estimated that pregnant women in Perth are exposed to between 0.3 &#150; 4.10 &#181;g/day ingested TTHM, and of this, the more toxic brominated forms accounted for between 0.27 &#150; 3.69 &#181;g/day. Based on a dose-response model used, birthweights calculated for the &#145;hypothetical&#146; exposures ranged from 3403.2g for the highest exposure to 3503.5g in the lowest exposure, which is a difference of over 100g. Although the resulting reduction in birth weight is not extreme, there is still a significant reduction in birth weight present as exposure to TTHMs increases. This is the first doseresponse model to be developed to assess an adverse pregnancy outcome based on pregnant women exposure data, and will be a useful tool for assessing varying exposures throughout not only Australia but also throughout the industrialised world, where DBP exposure is highly prevalent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Disinfection and disinfectants -- By-products</field><field name="subject">Drinking water -- Purification -- Disinfection -- By-products</field><field name="subject">Environmentally induced diseases</field><field name="subject">Health risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Disinfection By-products</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Adverse pregnancy outcomes</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0070</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating stable and versatile monolayer systems on carbon substrates for sensors and other applications</field><field name="creator">Liu, Guozhen, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to develop strategies for fabrication of carbon electrode surfaces with a view to creating stable and versatile monolayer systems for sensing and other applications. Glassy carbon (GC) electrodes have been successfully modified with versatile monolayers via the electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium salts. The surfaces modified with diazonium salt monolayers were properly characterised by electrochemistry, AFM and XPS. The rates of heterogeneous electron transfer through organic monolayers on GC, Pyrolysed Photoresist Films (PPF) and gold surfaces have been studied using ferrocene as the redox probe. The diazonium salt monolayers created on GC surfaces demonstrated very stable ability and can serve as a good alternative to alkanethiol selfassembled monolayers on gold electrodes for sensing purposes. Tripeptide Gly-Gly-His modified GC electrodes have been successfully used as the electrochemical copper sensors and were found to be extremely stable. PPF has proved to be a good alternative to the GC electrode for the commercialisation of the fabricated electrochemical sensors. The most important and difficult task of this project is to fabricate glucose biosensors and immunosensors on carbon electrodes. The rigid and conjugated molecular wires (MW) as the efficient conduit for electron transfer, and a molecule with poly(ethylene glycol) chains (PEG) as an insulator for reducing the non-specific protein adsorption were successfully synthesised and introduced in the sensing systems. MW modified on GC electrodes can be used to explore the deeply buried active site of glucose oxidase to achieve direct electron transfer of GOx from the active centre FAD through the MW to the underlying GC electrode, and to fabricate third generation biosensors. The interface comprising mixed monolayers of MW and PEG has the ability to facilitate efficient electron transfer. A label-free immunosensor system has been successfully developed for electrochemical detection of biomolecular pairs such as biotin/antibiotin with low detection limitation based on mixed monolayers of MW and PEG modified GC electrode surfaces. In addition, a displacement assay has shown that the free biotin can compete with the attached biotin for binding antibiotin. SWNTs can be used as an alternative to MW to fabricate another label-free immunosensor system due to the high efficiency of electron transfer that SWNTs have demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrochemical analysis</field><field name="subject">Biosensors</field><field name="subject">Electrodes, Carbon</field><field name="subject">Diazo compounds.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc oxide TCOs (Transparent Conductive Oxides) and polycrystalline silicon thin-films for photovoltaic applications</field><field name="creator">Song, Dengyuan, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-films are very promising for application in photovoltaics. It is extremely challenging to develop cheap TCOs and poly-Si films to make photovoltaic devices. The aim of this thesis is to study sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO TCO and poly-Si films by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) for application in low-cost photovoltaics. The investigated aspects have been (i) to develop and characterize sputtered aluminum-doped ZnO (ZnO:Al) films that can be used as a TCO material on crystalline silicon solar cells, (ii) to explore the potential of the developed ZnO:Al films for application in ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, (iii) to make and characterize poly-Si thin-films on different kinds of glass substrates by SPC using electron-beam evaporated amorphous silicon (a-Si) [referred to as EVA poly-Si material (SPC of evaporated a-Si)], and (iv) to fabricate EVA poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass and improve the energy conversion efficiency of these cells by post-crystallization treatments. The ZnO:Al work in this thesis is focused on the correlation between film characteristics and deposition parameters, such as rf sputter power (Prf), working gas pressure (Pw), and substrate temperature (Tsub), to get a clear picture of film properties in the optimized conditions for application in photovoltaic devices. Especially the laterally non-uniform film properties resulting from the laterally inhomogeneous erosion of the target material are investigated in detail. The influence of Prf, Pw and Tsub on the structural, electrical, optical and surface morphology properties of ZnO:Al films is discussed. It is found that the lateral variations of the parameters of ZnO:Al films prepared by rf magnetron sputtering can be reduced to acceptable levels by optimising the deposition parameters.  ZnO:Al/c-Si heterojunction solar cells are fabricated and characterized to demonstrate the feasibility of the fabricated ZnO:Al films for application in heterojunction solar cells. In this application, expensive indium-tin oxide (ITO) is usually used. Under the standard AM1.5G spectrum (100 mW/cm2, 25 ??C), the best fabricated cell shows an open-circuit voltage of 411 mV, a short-circuit current density of 30.0 mA/cm2, a fill factor of 66.7 %, and a conversion efficiency of 8.2 %. This is believed to be the highest stable efficiency ever reported for this type of cell. By means of dark forward current density-voltage-temperature (J-V-T) measurements, it is shown that the dominant current transport mechanism in the ZnO:Al/c-Si solar cells, in the intermediate forward bias voltage region, is trap-assisted multistep tunneling. EVA poly-Si thin-films are prepared on four types of glass substrates (planar and textured glass, both either bare or SiN-coated) based on evaporated Si, which is a cheaper Si deposition method than the existing technologies. The textured glass is realized by the UNSW-developed AIT process (AIT = aluminium-induced texture). The investigation is concentrated on finding optimized process parameters and evaluating film crystallization quality. It is found that EVA poly-Si films have a grain size in the range 0.8-1.5 ??m, and a preferential (111) orientation. UV reflectance and Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal a high crystalline material quality, both at the air-side surface and in the bulk. EVA cells are fabricated in both substrate and superstrate configuration. Special attention is paid to improving the Voc of the solar cells. For this purpose, after the SPC process, the samples receive the two post-crystallization treatments: (i) a rapid thermal anneal (RTA), and (ii) a plasma hydrogenation. It is found that two post-crystallization treatments more than double the 1-Sun Voc of the substrate-type cells. It is demonstrated that RTA improves the structural material quality of the cells. Furthermore, a hydrogenation step is shown to significantly improve the electronic material quality of the cells. Based on the RTA???d and hydrogenated EVA poly-Si material, the first mesa-type EVA cells are fabricated in substrate configuration, by using sputtered Al-doped ZnO as the transparent front contact. The investigation is focused on addressing the correlation between the type of the substrate and cell performance. Optical, electrical and photovoltaic properties of the devices are characterized. It is found that the performance  of EVA cells depends on the glass substrate topography. For cells on textured glass, the AIT texture is shown to have a beneficial effect on the optical absorption of EVA films. It is demonstrated that a SiN barrier layer on the AIT-textured glass improves significantly both the crystalline quality of the poly-Si films and the energy conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells. For cells on planar glass, a SiN film between the planar glass and the poly-Si film has no obvious effect on the cell properties. The investigations in this thesis clearly show that EVA poly-Si films are very promising for poly-Si thin-film solar cells on glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zinc oxide</field><field name="subject">polycrystalline semiconductors</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">thin films.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative analysis of creativity as misrecognition in the transactions between a visual arts teacher and their senior art students in the final year of schooling</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Kerry Anne, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis researches the proposition that student creativity occurs as a function of misrecognition in the culturally situated context of art classrooms. Following Pierre Bourdieu??s socio-cognitive frameworks of the habitus, symbolic capital and misrecognition this study uses these concepts as a means of navigating teacher-student relationships at moments of creative origination. These concepts predict that exchanges between teachers and students are sites for transactions of symbolic capital where the teacher??s pedagogical role is objectively repressed through the mechanism of misrecognition. The study seeks evidence for creative autonomy as misrecognition as it takes place in classroom transactions and that differing levels of ??tact?? are employed in these exchanges. It emerges that the social reasoning that underscores these exchanges is inferentially sensitive to different contextual points of view, expressed in open secrets, repression, denial and euphemisation. The study finds that the artworks produced evidence degrees of originality that vary in character according to the subtlety of misrecognition that is transacted in these pedagogical exchanges. The case of an art teacher and an art class in the final year of schooling is examined in detail. The design employs an idiographic, qualitative methodology. Methods include observations and interviews which are augmented by digital records. Results are interpreted using a form of semantic analysis and triangulation. Four functions are distilled from the results. These functions govern the way in which misrecognition performs as a contradictory logic in the relationships between the teacher and students which works towards affirming the group??s belief in creative autonomy, while paradoxically, all members take advantage of the contextual inputs that are available. Creative autonomy is revealed as a fiction, nonetheless, a fiction worth nurturing for the successful realisation of creative ends. The study concludes that creativity cannot be strictly taught or learned. Nor is it innate and autonomous. Rather it encompasses a socially intelligent uptake in the culture of artmaking. What is possible is dependent on shared beliefs, desires and intentions which are transformed over time. Broader implications are suggested focusing on the significance of collaboration in creative education and the impact for educational systems, schools and undergraduate programs in art education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social reasoning</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">misrecognition</field><field name="subject">practical reasoning</field><field name="subject">art teaching</field><field name="subject">art making</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of inflammation-associated S100 proteins in fibroblasts and their expression in atherosclerosis</field><field name="creator">Rahimi, Ahmed Farid, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The multigene family of Ca2+-binding S100 proteins comprises 22 members that have various important intra- and extracellular roles. The three inflammation-associated members of this family???S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 (collectively termed &amp;quotcalgranulins&amp;quot)???are constitutive neutrophil and monocyte proteins also expressed by macrophages within acute and chronic inflammatory lesions, but not in tissue macrophages. They are expressed in human/murine wounds and by appropriately activated macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes in vitro. The &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot are implicated in leukocyte activation/deactivation, fatty acid transport, leukocyte/fibroblast chemotaxis, transmigration and adhesion, embryogenesis, wound healing, protection against oxidants and antibacterial defence. Chapter 3 of this thesis explores growth-factor- and cytokine-mediated regulation and expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in fibroblasts, and demonstrates spatio-temporal expression of S100A8 in rat dermal wounds. Fibroblasts are stromal resident cells with important regulatory immune-inflammatory functions in wound healing, tissue remodelling and fibrosis. Fibroblast migration, proliferation, differentiation and their synthetic repertoire are modulated by various factors including extracellular matrix components, growth factors, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and cytokines. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), interleukin-1?(IL-1? and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are potent fibroblast mitogens; PDGF and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-? are fibroblast chemoattractants. FGF-2 and IL-1?promote fibroblast proliferation, whereas TGF-?promotes myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon ?(IFN?, tumour-necrosis factor ? (TNF?, TGF-?and PDGF did not induce the S100A8 gene in fibroblasts whereas FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) maximally induced mRNA 12 hr. after stimulation and this declined over 36 hr. The FGF-2 response was strongly enhanced and prolonged by optimal levels of heparin (1-10 IU/ml), maximally at 18 hr. post-stimulation. FGF-2/heparin-induced responses depended on cell-cell contact in vitro. IL-1?(10 U/ml) alone, or in synergy with FGF-2/heparin strongly induced the gene in 3T3 and primary fibroblasts. Dexamethasone (10???6 M) enhanced LPS- and FGF-2/-IL-1?induced responses. S100A9 mRNA was not induced by any of these mediators. Induction of S100A8 in the absence of S100A9 was confirmed in primary fibroblast-like cells by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction. FGF-2-heparin- and IL-1?induced mRNA expression depended on de-novo protein synthesis and was partially mediated by the mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway of activation. Preliminary promoter deletion analyses indicated that FGF-2-responsive elements in the gene promoter were distinct from those responsive to IL-1? TGF-?(2 ng/ml) significantly suppressed gene induction mediated by FGF-2 ?heparin/LPS/dexamethasone, but not by IL-1? TGF-?may compromise mRNA stability. Protein levels in FGF-2-heparin-IL-1?stimulated fibroblasts correlated well with mRNA levels and expression was mainly cytoplasmic. Immunohistochemistry indicated S100A8 associated with keratinocytes, neutrophils, macrophage-like cells and some hair follicles in wounded rat skin. Rat wounds also contained numerous S100A8- positive fibroblast-like cells 2 and 4 days post-injury; numbers declined by 7 days. Upregulation of S100A8 by FGF-2/IL-1? down-regulation by TGF-? and time-dependent expression of S100A8 in wound fibroblasts suggest a role in fibroblast differentiation at sites of inflammation and repair. Intracellular fibroblast-derived S100A8 may also regulate intracellular redox equilibrium and antioxidant defence. Atherosclerosis is a progressive chronic disease with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. S100A1 and S100B are associated with dendritic cells and lymphocytes in experimental rodent and human atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes and macrophages in plaques of ApoE???/??? mice express S100A9 but not S100A8. Myeloperoxidase and HOClmediated oxidative mechanisms are fundamental in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and S100A8 is exquisitely sensitive to HOCl oxidation which generates sulphinamide bonds, novel non-reducible cysteine-lysine covalent bonds. Chapter 4 of this thesis presents novel evidence that, in contrast to the murine ApoE???/??? model, the three human &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot were expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques, but not in normal arteries. High levels of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were evident in macrophages and foam cells. Some neovessels were anti-S100A8-/anti-S100A9-immunoreactive; S100A9 staining was also evident on the extracellular matrix. Patterns of expression of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were overlapping in serial sections, except that only smooth muscle cells were S100A12-positive. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA were also expressed by macrophages, foam cells and endothelial cells, indicating gene up-regulation rather than passive protein uptake. Western blotting of plaque extracts revealed monomeric S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 and larger complexes. Some were resistant to reduction, suggesting non-disulfide covalent cross-linking, possibly via sulphinamide bonds. Stable S100A8-S100A9 complexes were also detected after immunoaffinity purification. In an in-vitro system, molar ratios of HOCl of &amp;gt1 generated stable complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 whereas ~800 and ~100-fold excess HOCl oxidises apolipoprotein B-100 and BSA, respectively. S100A8 and S100A9 protected low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against HOCl oxidation in a thiol-independent manner. Because HOCl-oxidised S100s did not contain epitopes recognised by an antibody used to detect HOCl-oxidised proteins in plaque, levels of oxidised proteins in plaque are likely to be significantly greater than described. S100A8 and S100A9 may protect LDL by functioning as HOCl-scavengers. However, chronic oxidative cross-linking of S100A8 and S100A9 with other proteins and extracellular matrix components may contribute to plaque pathogenesis. These studies support key roles for the &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot in chronic inflammation, wound healing and atherogenesis possibly by regulating cellular differentiation, activation and modulation of redox-dependent mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Calcium-binding proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20503</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the nature of teacher knowledge needed and used in teaching statistics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctorate in Education (Ed.D.) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Timothy Angus</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the knowledge needed for teaching statistics through investigations at the primary (elementary) school level. Statistics has a relatively short history in the primary school curriculum, compared with mathematics. Recent research in statistics education has prompted a worldwide move away from the teaching of statistical skills, towards a broader underpinning of statistical thinking and reasoning. New Zealand&#8217;s nationally mandated curriculum reflects this move. Consequently, little is known about the types of knowledge needed to teach statistics effectively. Ideas from two contemporary areas of research, namely teacher content knowledge in relation to mathematics, and statistical thinking, are incorporated into a new framework, for exploring knowledge for teaching statistics. The study&#8217;s methodological approach is based on Popper&#8217;s philosophy of realism, and the associated logic of learning approach for classroom research. Four primary teachers (in their second year of teaching) planned and taught a sequence of four or five lessons, which were videotaped. Following each lesson, a stimulated recall interview, using an edited video of the lesson, was conducted with the teacher. The video and interview recordings were analysed in relation to the teacher knowledge and statistical thinking framework. The results provide detailed descriptions of the components of teacher knowledge in relation to statistical thinking that are needed and used in the classroom. Included in the results are profiles of each teacher&#8217;s knowledge. These profiles describe &#8216;missed opportunities&#8217;, which were defined as classroom incidents in which teacher knowledge was needed but not used, and consequently resulted in the teachers not taking advantage of chances to enhance students&#8217; learning. A number of significant themes were revealed, linked to knowledge for teaching statistics. The themes include: problems associated with teacher listening; the need for the teacher to be familiar with the data; students&#8217; difficulties with various components of the statistical investigation cycle; and understanding variation and the development of inference. The study concludes that for effective teaching of statistics through investigations, it is necessary for teachers to have knowledge in each of four categories as related to each component of statistical thinking. If any aspect of knowledge is not available or not used, teachers will not enhance, and could disadvantage, students&#8217; learning. Implications from the findings are considered for initial and on-going teacher education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">teacher knowledge</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of MNEs in shaping the institutional environment of the host country</field><field name="creator">Kim, Joseph Hyosup, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rapid advancement in technology and increased trade across national borders led to an international trend towards valuing technology and knowledge-based assets.

The importance of protecting intellectual property rights is particularly crucial in cultural industries such as music industry.

The move from a unified public service to the use of third sector organisations such as The Salvation Army to deliver public services represents a major shift in institutional relationships. This study focuses on the introduction of market discourse throughout the contracting process, in particular how this discourse seeks to reconstruct service users as &#8216;customers&#8217;, and the Salvation Army&#8217;s response to this reconstruction. By exploring the ways in which this religiously and socially motivated non-profit organisation sought to mediate neo-liberal discourses of competition and consumerism, this study seeks to reveal the processes and pressures affecting faith-based and other non-profit organisations which increasingly find themselves acting as agents of government policy under the principles of New Public Management (NPM). The altered relationships brought about by the shift in institutional relationships depend upon new institutional forms to deliver government services, and these new relationships are manifestly displayed in the Job Network. This study focuses on the ways in which The Salvation Army mediates social policy within this new institutional relationship. The changing relationship between government and The Salvation Army, as manifested in the development and implementation of employment policy in Australia between 1998 to 2007 is explored in this study. Neo-institutional theory provides the theoretical framework of this study. Neoinstitutional theory addresses the impact of shifts in the relationships between government and third sector organisations such as The Salvation Army via contracting out of government employment services. This changing relationship between government and The Salvation Army, as played out in the specific institutional field of the employment service through the creation of the Job Network is explored in this study. Within a constructionist approach, Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is deployed as the analytical technology. This study uses textual material as its main source of primary data, including extracts from job network contracts, internal and public Salvation Army documents, and utterances by government. The study explores the ways in which The Salvation Army has attempted to mediate social policy and the organisational tensions that arise as the Army seeks to maintain organizational independence. This study reveals that though government as the creator of the new quasi-market and purchaser of services in that market is perhaps the most powerful actor, the new institutional relationships are not completely a master/servant relationship; third sector organisations such as The Salvation Army do have the capacity to influence government. Additionally, this study calls into question the notions that the third sector and the government sector are differentiated realms and suggests that new paradigms should be developed to explore the institutional relationships that are now developing in the provision of welfare services in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salvation Army</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">nonprofit organizations</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">Job Network (Australia)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38311</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the extent of and the potential for Arab economic integration</field><field name="creator">Elafif, Mohamed</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to examine the extent of and the potential for Arab economic integration. It adds to the growing literature on the issue of economic integration by throwing the spotlight on several issues hitherto little considered in the existing literature. The thesis especially blends various aspects of economic integration with models of spatial competition, economic geography, regionalisation and globalisation to explain the problems of and prospects for economic integration for the Arab countries. It is important to realise that economic integration has become an important aim for almost all countries in the world; in particular, less developed countries, which need more economic efforts to be able to deal with the current international milieu and the gale of globalisation. The Arab countries have engaged in a number of initiatives to advance economic integration, however despite this the degree of economic integration among them is still relatively insignificant. The thesis also attempts to offer theoretical models to explain the obstacles preventing economic integration in the Arab world. This thesis is, to the best of the author&#8217;s knowledge and belief, the first rigorous study of the extent of and the potential for Arab economic integration through three vital economic perspectives: trade, investment and labour flows. In the first perspective, this study investigates the nature of intra-Arab trade and which particular countries/sub-group of countries may potentially become an integrated regional production system, or hub. This investigation is done within the scope of gravity models, which assume that intra-trade is a function of the GDPs of the involved countries and the distance between them. The thesis extends the literature by introducing spatial models and models of new economic geography to explain how economic integration evolves in the current international milieu concomitantly driven by globalisation and regionalisation. In the second perspective, this study investigates intra-Arab FDI and capital mobility. The postulated model assumes that intra-Arab FDI is a function of a number of economic variables, such as GDP, GDP per capita, inflation and purchasing power parity. The thesis offers a comprehensive theoretical model to explain how successful economic integration can be carried out by FDI flows. In the third perspective, the study investigates intra-Arab labour flows. The proposed model utilises remittances as an indicator of labour flows. It assumes that remittances are a function of some economic variables, such as GDP per capita, the real price of oil, and the oil production of Saudi Arabia, which represents the main Arab host country of Arab labour flows. The proposed theoretical model offers insights into the dynamics of labour flows and oil price movements. The econometric study in the thesis applies panel data for the period 1985-2005, and employs Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) fixed effects regression. The most important empirical finding of the study is that Arab economic integration has been significantly affected by intra-trade, intra-FDI and intra-labour flows among sub-unions of Arab countries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arab cooperation</field><field name="subject">international economic integration</field><field name="subject">Arab countries</field><field name="subject">foreign economic relations</field><field name="subject">economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38359</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scheherazade</field><field name="creator">Missen, Jennifer</field><field name="description">"When we are unconscious of a thing which is constellated, we are identified with it,

Scheherazade is the story of Felicity who is in pursuit of a dream to become a solo violinist. As she ploughs into Year 12, she is so absorbed by her goals that she neglects her social environment: family; friends; relaxation. Sometimes she is barely conscious of their presence. At the Year 12 formal, she is forced to realise the consequences of the choices she is making. Writing Scheherazade, my first novel, was a lesson in dealing with and learning about mastering the writing process. The exegesis shows the journey of taking pieces of unconsciously/subconsciously created writing and turning them into pieces ofa deliberately crafted complex whole. Starting with a premise -If you don't pursue your dreams, you will live with regret -I found it easy to put together a character and give her a dream. Bringing in aspects of adolescent theory, I could contrast her with her friends and her parents. But all of the conflict was external and Felicity was unlikable. When I investigated other Young Adult and Junior fiction I found that I needed to bring the conflict more inside Felicity. Then I had a story.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teenagers</field><field name="subject">fiction</field><field name="subject">girls</field><field name="subject">relationships</field><field name="subject">adolesence</field><field name="subject">friendship</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090526.092224</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discussing the nature of painting through the poetics of transaction and experience</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Sandra</field><field name="description">This research project will explore American philosopher John Dewey&#8217;s theory of transaction, and Shannon Sullivan&#8217;s interpretation of Dewey&#8217;s theory, the &#8216;Transactional Body&#8217;, and their inherent potential for the making and reception of painting.  Dewey stated (Dewey, cited in Sullivan: 1-2) that organisms live as much in processes across and 'through' skins as in processes 'within skins'.  Sullivan&#8217;s &#8216;transactional body&#8217; is always in a state of flux, a morphic body in perpetual motion.  Within an artistic context this raises the possibility of exploring the theory of transaction as it applies to painting, using the concept of automatic intuitive art practice.  Central to this investigation will be direct connection between senses, instincts, intuition, and the painting.  Sullivan suggests that truth and wisdom can be pursued through somatic experience. Therefore the process will be explored by an extension of the corporeal body through the physicality of gesture, movement, rhythm, colour, and mark making.  A recurring subtext throughout this investigation will be that of &#8216;duality&#8217;; specifically that defined as the struggle between the use of the conscious, critical mind, allowing for the transaction between artist, paint and canvas to occur naturally and intuitively.  The conscious mind / intuition duality manifests at various stages during the manufacture and reception of a painting.  Whilst the project relies upon automatic and intuitive praxis, conscious decisions are made regarding the size and shape of the canvas, the medium used, and through reflective analysis of the completed work.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenomenology</field><field name="subject">Heuristics</field><field name="subject">Art and experience</field><field name="subject">Acrylic on canvas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/643</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child road trauma: a profile for children in New South Wales and evaluation of properly-used age-appropriate restraints as a countermeasure</field><field name="creator">Du, Wei, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Child road trauma poses a preventable public health burden to the community. This PhD research aimed to: 1) quantify the magnitude of child passenger injuries in New South Wales (NSW), Australia; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of different restraint use to prevent fatalities among child passengers; and 3) estimate the benefit in the general child population from different intervention targets relating to restraint use. It comprised two studies to validate methodology and four independent epidemiological studies. The first study to validate methodology assessed the data item availability and categorization across different road traffic injury surveillance data collections in NSW in relation to World Health Organization recommended data item lists and necessary data item lists for road traffic injury research. Exclusion of, or insufficient categorization of, crucial data items such as restraint use and injurious outcome existed for each data collection. The other study to validate methodology assessed the performance (in terms of incidence estimates, sensitivity, and specificity) of several methods for removing multiple counting when conducting analyses on hospital separation data for child passenger injuries under either primary-diagnosis or all-diagnoses based injury definition, using linkage methods as a comparison. The "readmission"-based criterion consistently best approximated the linkage-method-derived incidence rate. Two epidemiological studies used NSW hospital separation datasets and quantified the magnitude of child road trauma in NSW in terms of hospitalisation rates. One study examined the trend in hospitalised injury incidence rates during the period of July 1998 to June 2005 using a non-parametric estimation method, and reported a non-significant decline of hospitalised injuries to child passengers over time. The second study used Poisson regression to demonstrate that rural NSW children were two times more likely to suffer hospitalised injuries compared with their urban counterparts. The third epidemiological study used the Fatality Analysis Reporting Systems (FARS) from the United States (US) and estimated the association between different restraint uses and child passenger fatality using a matched cohort method. Improperly using restraints significantly elevated the risk of death for child passengers involved in a crash compared to any other restraint use. The advantage of child restraints over seat belts in terms of fatality reduction was not statistically significant, although previous studies have shown an advantage for serious injury reduction. The last study was performed to quantify the relative public health benefit in terms of reduction in child passenger deaths and injuries for different interventions relating to restraint use in the general population using a case-based population attributable risk fraction method. Results support the ongoing child restraint legislation change in Australia to require compulsory child restraint uses for children up to their 7th birthday, and an increasing proper use of age-appropriate restraints would provide the greatest reduction in fatalities and injuries among child passengers assuming equal population uptake for all interventions.  In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that child road trauma remains a public health burden to the Australian community; and highlights the importance of properly using age-appropriate restraints in preventing injuries to child passengers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Car passengers.</field><field name="subject">Child.</field><field name="subject">Road traffic injuries.</field><field name="subject">Restraints.</field><field name="subject">Motor vehicle.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Point source compensation ??? a backpropagation method for underwater acoustic imaging</field><field name="creator">Yee, Clifford Wing Wei, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The backpropagation method of image reconstruction has been known for some time with the advantage of fast processing due to the use of Fast Fourier Transform. But its applicability to underwater imaging has been limited. At present the shift-and-add method is the more widely used method in underwater imaging. This is due to the fact that backpropagation has been derived for plane wave insonification, with the scattered waves detected in transmission-mode, or synthetic aperture set-up. One of the methods being used for underwater imaging is to use a point source for the insonification of the target and the scattered waves detected in reflection-mode by a receiver array. An advantage of this scanning method is only one transmission of the source is required to capture an image, instead of multiple transmissions. Therefore motion artifacts are kept to minimum. To be able to exploit the processing speed of the backpropagation method, it must be adapted for point source insonification. The coverage of this configuration in the literature has been scant, methods for spherical sources have been proposed for transmission mode and arbitrary surfaces in geophysical applications. These methods are complex and difficult to use. A novel point source compensation method is proposed in this thesis so that the backpropagation image formation method can be used for the point source insonification set-up. The method of investigation undertaken to derive this new backpropagation method was through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental verification. The effect of various compensation factors on the image quality was studied in simulation. In the experimental verification, practical issues relating to the application of the new method was addressed. The final proof of concept of our method was undertaken with our experimental verification. The quality of images formed with the point source compensation methods has also been compared with that with the shiftand- add method. Experimental and simulation results show that the point source compensated backpropagation algorithm can produce images of comparable quality with those formed with shift-and-add method for the set-up of wideband point-source insonification with detection in reflection-mode, with the advantage of faster image formation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustic imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20590</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for sustainability through cleaner production</field><field name="creator">Aschner, Andrew, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The concept of sustainable development is receiving a great deal of attention in industry. However, the operational processes for industrial environmental management are still at an early stage of development and despite the best efforts of operations management and environmental specialists a great many products and services continue to be unsustainable. This presents threats to society and risks for survival to manufacturers. The purpose of the Thesis is to accelerate environmental improvements through the uptake of Cleaner Production concepts by developing a methodology for guiding manufacturing enterprises. The tenets of the proposed methodology include: o oo Reliance on a strategic approach ooo Development of an implementation path similar to those used in introducing other major culture and technology changes ooo Culture and policy change are strategically generated from within manufacturing organisations Specifically, the main objectives of the Project are: 1. to invent a relatively easily implementable methodology for planning for sustainability for manufacturing enterprises of all sizes 2. to address the major industrial environmental management issues at all levels within the enterprise as one seamless process 3. to configure the methodology so that it may be incorporated into an existing body of knowledge, e.g., manufacturing management/manufacturing engineering 4. to minimise complexities by standardising key concepts and terminology The Thesis integrates Sustainability and Cleaner Production concepts, systems and technologies and performance indicators with a planning model to arrive at what has been termed as &amp;quot the Strategy Development and Implementation with Cleaner Production&amp;quot process. This solution addresses the key point of integrating Cleaner Production concepts ii with the manufacturing planning processes, but just as importantly, it also establishes the links between the steps from strategy initiation through to implementation, from the boardroom down to the factory floor. The main modules of the work are: o oo establishing relationships between strategic, business and manufacturing plans using the concepts of Sustainability, Eco-efficiency and Cleaner Production ooo development of links between planning and operations using the concepts of Industrial Ecology and Life Cycle Management ooo development of a classification system, referred to as a Cleaner Production toolkit, to promote optimum selection of hard and soft systems and technologies ooo development of appropriate Cleaner Production Indicators to complete the loop.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial management</field><field name="subject">Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Sustainable development.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20669</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways in context: Background characteristics and demographics in student progression through higher education</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Rosalie Ann</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student progression</field><field name="subject">completion</field><field name="subject">attrition and retention</field><field name="subject">student characteristics</field><field name="subject">performance indicators</field><field name="subject">Pathways Theory</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">course transfer</field><field name="subject">undergraduate study</field><field name="subject">longitudinal data</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4999</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A score for measuring the quality of controlled experiments in computing and health informatics</field><field name="creator">Lui, Keith J.</field><field name="description">The controlled experiment is a highly regarded form of scientific inquiry because its properties permit conclusions with the most scientific rigor. Controlled experimentation is important for the scientific foundation of disciplines that claim to be scientific. It is also important to conduct them properly: they come at a high cost in time, effort and participation; there is an associated esteem that confers credibility; there is often an ethical responsibility to human participants. However, the quality of controlled experiments performed in health informatics and computer science is often poor. One way to address quality issues is to measure quality. This follows the example of the creation of instruments (scales or scores) to measure quality of controlled medical trials, which have also had problems with experimental quality. The rationale for this research was that no satisfactory scales had been developed for informatics.

This thesis focuses on the development of advanced PGSE NMR methods for conducting self-diffusion measurements on magnetically inhomogeneous (i.e., containing materials with different magnetic susceptibilities), aqueous or slowly diffusing samples. PGSE NMR diffusion measurements rely on the accurate encoding of the position of each diffusing particle by the use of pulses of spatially well-defined magnetic gradients. However, for a magnetically inhomogeneous sample, local magnetic field gradients (i.e., background gradients) with unknown intensities and directions, which are normally generated by the differences in magnetic susceptibilities inside and/or around the sample, can also lead to the position encoding of the diffusing particles. This position encoding may couple with the position encoding caused by the applied pulsed gradients and thus cause errors in PGSE NMR diffusion measurements. Although in numerous cases background gradients are assumed to be spatially and temporally constant in order to simply the analysis of the background gradient based position encoding, in general the background gradient experienced by each diffusing particle is non-constant both spatially and temporally because of the complex sample structure and particles diffusing through different magnetic environments. To suppress the deleterious effects of the (non-constant) background gradients, a new stimulated-echo (STE)-based PGSE method with the intensities of pulsed gradients at a magic ratio (MAG), MAG-PGSTE, was developed for the determination of self-diffusion in magnetically inhomogeneous samples. The method was tested on two water saturated glass bead packs (i.e., 212-300 &#956;m and less than 106 &#956;m glass beads). The MAG-PGSTE method was compared to the magic asymmetric gradient STE-based PGSE (MAGSTE or MPFG) method, which is newly developed for the suppression of the deleterious effects of the (non-constant) background gradients in only one transient, and Cotts 13-interval method, one of the most successful suppression methods based on the assumption of constant background gradients, using both glass bead samples. The MAG-PGSTE and MAGSTE method outperformed the Cotts 13-interval method in the measurement of diffusion coefficients; more interestingly, for the less than 106 &#956;m glass bead sample with smaller bead sizes and thus higher background gradients, the MAG-PGSTE method provided higher signal-to-noise ratios and thus better diffusion measurements than the MAGSTE and Cotts 13-interval methods. In addition, when using relatively long pulsed gradients (e.g., 3 ms), the MAG-PGSTE method provided good bead size characterizations. Due to solubility problems, limited sample availability and/or aggregation, solvent (e.g., water) signals in NMR are typically 4-5 orders of magnitude higher than the solute signals. The huge solvent signal not only overlaps with the signals of interest but also saturates the NMR receiver and thus prevents the detection of the weak signals from the molecules of interest. To achieve a high degree of water suppression in PGSE NMR diffusion measurements, a new STE-based PGSE method incorporating the WATERGATE method, which is based on the selective manipulation of the water signal by the use of a binomial-like selective inversion sequence (i.e., a group of radio frequency (RF) pulses with symmetric pulse duration arrangement separated by equal delays), PGSTE-WATERGATE, was developed. The method is simple to set up and particularly suited to measuring diffusion coefficients in aqueous solution, which is commonly required in pharmaceutical and combinatorial applications. The method was tested on a sample containing lysozyme in 10% 2H2O and 90% 1H2O and a sample containing sucrose in 10% 2H2O and 90% 1H2O and provided superb water suppression and accurate diffusion measurements. Importantly, the new method provided the high degree suppression of the phase distortions in NMR spectra caused by the use of selective inversion pulses or sequences. In the NMR spectrum of an aqueous (bio-molecular) sample, especially a protein sample, the water signal almost always overlaps with the signals of interest. Therefore, a good water suppression technique should target only the water signal. The selectivity of the PGSTE-WATERGATE method depends on the selectivity of the binomial-like selective inversion sequence. The traditional way to enhance the selectivity of a binomial-like sequence is to increase the number of RF pulses contained in the binomial-like sequence. This type of selectivity enhancement is very effective but leads to longer sequence durations and thus the signal loss due to NMR relaxation. In this research, two 6-pulse phase-modulated binomial-like inversion sequences were developed by simultaneously optimizing the RF pulse durations and phases instead of increasing the number of the RF pulses. In combination with the excitation sculpting method, which contains two WATERGATE unit and affords the suppression of phase distortions caused by the phase modulations on the binomial-like sequences, both of the new binomial-like sequences outperformed the well-known 3-9- 19 sequence, a 6-pulse binomial-like sequence with a pulse duration ratio of 3:9:19:19:9:3, in selectivity and inversion width. The new sequences provided the similar selectivity and inversion width to the W5 sequence, a 10-pulse binomial-like sequence, but with significantly shorter sequence durations. When used in PGSTEWATERGATE, they afforded highly selective water suppression in diffusion experiments. The hydrodynamics of slowly diffusing molecules (e.g., protein) and small particles (e.g., protein aggregates) has long been of scientific interest due to its importance in the understanding of many biological and biophysical processes such as protein crystallization. However, the diffusion measurements on these molecules and small particles confront the PGSE NMR methods with huge challenges because the diffusion coefficients of these molecules and small particles are normally at or under the lower diffusion determination limit of the PGSE NMR methods, which is mainly controlled by the maximum pulsed gradient strength of the NMR probe (i.e., high pulsed gradient strengths are preferred for measuring slow diffusion), the pulsed gradient durations (i.e., long gradient durations are preferred for measuring slow diffusion), and the observation time (i.e., long observation times are preferred for measuring slow diffusion) which is limited by the NMR relaxation times of the molecules and small particles. To overcome this problem, multi-quantum NMR coherences may be utilized in PGSE NMR experiments as these coherences are more sensitive to the encoding by the pulsed gradients than normal single quantum coherences (e.g., the encoding effect of a pulsed gradient on a single quantum coherence may be doubled by using a double-quantum coherence). In this research, five new multi-quantum coherence encoding STE-based PGSE methods were successfully developed. The new multi-quantum PGSE methods were tested on a sample containing L-[3-13C]-alanine in 2H2O. The quadruple quantum and triple quantum coherences from 13CH3, which can greatly enhance the encoding by pulsed gradients, were successfully selected using these new sequences. This thesis contains eight chapters. In Chapter 1, the focus of this thesis, translational diffusion, is introduced and the difficulties in the PGSE NMR diffusion measurements on magnetically inhomogeneous, aqueous, and slowly diffusing samples are also introduced. In Chapter 2, to facilitate the understanding of how PGSE NMR diffusion measurements work, both the basic principles and simulation methods of NMR and the fundamentals of PGSE NMR diffusion measurements are given. In Chapter 3, a brief review on the current advanced PGSE NMR methods for measuring diffusion in magnetically inhomogeneous, aqueous, and slowly diffusing samples is given. In Chapter 4, the experimental details of the research work in this thesis are given. From Chapter 5 to Chapter 7, newly developed PGSE NMR methods and their applications are discussed in detail. In Chapter 8, the general conclusions are given.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="subject">diffusion</field><field name="subject">molecular dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38466</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doctors at Work: Determinants of Supply and Demand in the Australian General Practice Market</field><field name="creator">McRae, Ian Stewart</field><field name="description">During the period 1996 to 2003 the number of GP services per capita in Australia fell by 14 percent and the proportion of services bulk billed (ie provided at no cost to the patient) fell by 12 percentage points.  The Government responded to these trends by outlaying hundreds of millions of dollars to increase Government medical insurance rebates, to increase the number of GPs in Australia, and to provide incentives for GPs to bulk bill.  
&#182;
There has been no comprehensive modelling of the GP market to assist in understanding the reasons for either the declining trends or whether the Government responses were successful.  This thesis aims to fill that gap.
&#182;
Previous Australian modelling of the GP market has been cross sectional and mostly demand focused.  This thesis uses panel data to minimise the biases caused by unobserved heterogeneity and border crossing, and to estimate explicit supply and demand equations to enable the relationship between supply and demand to be explored.  
&#182;
This approach estimates the impact on GP market outcomes of both policy decisions regarding rebates and GP numbers, and of external changes such as the trends in social attitudes and age.  The likely future paths of the market without further policy change can be considered, and the measures needed to meet given policy targets determined.
&#182;
In addressing these questions it is also shown that supplier induced demand does apply in Australian general practice but is not material, that previous cross sectional analysis was biased due to border crossing by patients, that GPs who charge patients with concession cards less than other patients are behaving economically rationally, and that when the Government increases the Medicare rebate payment, 85% of the increase goes to the GP and 15% to the patient.  The analysis also shows that GP density has no significant effect on mortality in Australia, and was unable to detect any effect of the business cycle on mortality.
&#182;
The demand curve for Australian general practice services is shown to be fundamentally determined by the real value of the MBS rebate in the short term, where the real value adjusted for growth in average weekly earnings. 
&#182;
The supply curve is determined by aggregate numbers of GPs and by the number of services they each provide.  The average number of services provided per GP is determined by GP age and gender, but more importantly by a trend effect thought to be due to attitudinal changes which must be explored further, and must be incorporated into any prediction of GP market outcomes.
&#182;
The thesis provides the first empirically based overview of the behaviour of the GP market at end of the twentieth century, and shows how Government policy levers and other trends interact to generate the market outcomes.  If the Government has targets for service levels or charging patterns in general practice, these models can facilitate determination of the policy options appropriate to achieve those targets.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">General practice</field><field name="subject">supply</field><field name="subject">demand</field><field name="subject">supplier induced demand</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090520.151351</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalized Maximum Entropy, Convexity and Machine Learning</field><field name="creator">Sears, Timothy Dean</field><field name="description">This thesis identi&#64257;es and extends techniques that can be linked to the principle

One common tactic is the use of innovative materials, such as advanced composites. Composite materials are suited to structural connection by adhesive bonding, which minimises the need for inefficient mechanical fastening.      The aim of this PhD project was to investigate the application of existing, yet immature Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques to adhesively bonded composite aerospace structures. The PhD study focused on two emerging SHM technologies - frequency response and comparative vacuum monitoring (CVM). This project aimed to provide missing critical information for each technique. This included determining sensitivity to damage, repeatability of results, and operating limitations for the frequency response method. Study of the CVM technique aimed to address effectiveness of damage detection, manufacture of sensor cavities, and the influence of sensor integration on mechanical performance of bonded structures.      Experimental research work is presented examining the potential of frequency response techniques for the detection of debonding in composite-to-composite external patch repairs. Natural frequencies were found to decrease over a discrete frequency range as the debond size increased; confirming that such features could be used to both detect and characterise damage. The effectiveness of the frequency response technique was then confirmed for composite patch and scarf repair specimens for free-free and fixed-fixed boundary conditions. Finally, the viability of the frequency response technique was assessed for a scarf repair of a real aircraft component, where it was found that structural damping limited the maximum useable frequency.      The feasibility of CVM technique for the inspection of co-cured stiffener-skin aircraft structures was explored. The creation of sensor cavities with tapered mandrels was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the stiffener, including crimping and waviness of fibres and resin-rich zones between plies. Representative stiffened-skin structure with two sensor cavity configurations (parallel and perpendicular to the stiffener direction) was tested to failure in tension and compression. While tensile failure strength was significantly reduced for both configurations (up to 25%), no appreciable differences in compression properties were found.      Two potential sensor cavity configurations were investigated for the extension of the CVM technique to pre-cured and co-bonded scarf repair schemes. The creation of radial and circumferential CVM sensor cavities was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the adhesive bond-line and the architecture of the repair material in the case of the co-bonded repair. These alterations changed the failure mode and reduced the tensile failure strength of the repair. A fibre straightening mechanism responsible for progressive failure (specific to co-bonded repairs with circumferential cavities) was identified, and subsequently supported with acoustic emission testing and numerical analysis. While fatigue performance was generally reduced by the presence of CVM cavities, the circumferential cavities appeared to retard crack progression, reducing sensitivity to the accumulation of fatigue damage.       These outcomes have brought forward the implementation of SHM in bonded composite structures, which has great potential to improve the operating efficiency of next generation aircraft.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">composite</field><field name="subject">adhesive</field><field name="subject">joint</field><field name="subject">repair</field><field name="subject">SHM</field><field name="subject">CVM</field><field name="subject">frequency response</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090602.142122</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Fertiliser Use in the Glenelg Hopkins Catchment</field><field name="creator">Schlapp, Julia Emily</field><field name="description">The improvement of water quality in the streams of the Glenelg Hopkins catchment is a priority of the Glenelg Hopkins regional strategy. A major source of water pollution in the region is linked to agricultural activities as high nutrient levels from runoff have the potential to increase the incidence of blue-green algae in the waterways. Land use change, reduced rainfall, more frequent extreme rainfall events and higher temperatures associated with climate change are likely to exacerbate this trend.  Water testing data of the Total Phosphorus (TP) levels in the Hopkins River and at other sites within the Hopkins Catchment indicate increasing incidence of TP above the Environment Protection Authority's target levels for extended periods of each year.       Earlier research indicated that phosphorus in runoff increases when pasture fertility increases and that fertiliser management practices should be considered as an element of preventative action for reducing nutrient pollution. During our research, a survey was undertaken in the Hopkins River catchment, to determine the current management of phosphorus (P) fertilisers on grazing and mixed enterprise farms, the attitude of farmers to natural resource management and their understanding of nutrient pollution. The survey also gathered information on the way farmers made fertiliser management decisions. If cooperation relating to phosphorus fertiliser application could be facilitated between groups of farmers, it may be possible to reduce nutrient runoff into the Hopkins waterways.      Cooperative game theory has successfully been used worldwide in the resolution of environmental problems where there is an economic impact to the decision making process. In this project, the amount of phosphorus applied per hectare was used in a cooperative game theory model assessing the potential for cooperative action on phosphorus management by groups of farmers, based on the trade off between the economic cost of pollution to the region waterways and the economic production benefits to the individual. The outcome of this work was individual optimal strategies for fertiliser application, allowing individual farmers to reduce their impact of agricultural production on the health of the catchment.      Involving the farmer groups, while undertaking the project, raised awareness amongst the farming population of the regional nutrient pollution caused by runoff from agricultural land, and enlisted their assistance towards adopting a cooperative approach to the problem. In addition, the results have been mapped using a Geographical Information System (GIS) for visual presentation and to demonstrate the use of this process in natural resource management with the farmer groups.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Game Theory Modelling</field><field name="subject">Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">Cooperative Game Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090602.144534</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial distribution of the rodent population at Boundary Stream Mainland Island and determination of the efficacy of different baits used for rodent control</field><field name="creator">Wissel, Silke</field><field name="description">Poison operations are a widely used technique for rodent control in the indigenous forests of New Zealand. This study examined the bait-take and rat monitoring data obtained for continuous poison operations at Boundary Stream Mainland Island (BSMI), Hawke&#8217;s Bay, between 1996 and 2007. Since the beginning of the Mainland Island project at BSMI in 1996, 800 ha of indigenous forest have been treated with an &#8216;Integrated Pest Management&#8217; approach, in which rodents (primarily ship rats) have been targeted by consecutive ground poison operations. The aim of the intensive pest control was to allow the ecosystem to recover and provide a safe environment for threatened native bird species to recover or be re-introduced. Another important aim of this pest control is to provide experience and expert knowledge in management techniques especially applicable to the protection of indigenous habitat on the New Zealand mainland. This research study had two main aims: to identify spatial patterns of the rodent population at BSMI and to determine the efficacy of the different rodenticides applied for their control. The distribution of the rodent population was investigated by spatial analysis of bait-take across the reserve and through time. Visualisation of high and low bait-take areas revealed that there was a noticeable reinvasion from adjacent unmanaged native forests, but not markedly from exotic forest or pasture. Reinvasion from small and isolated adjacent forests ceased to be noticeable consistently after approximately four years of the poison operation, while a large scenic native reserve, as well as a narrow part of the treatment area surrounded by many native bush patches, were continuously affected by reinvasion through the entire project time. Bait-take was visibly higher after the bait had either been removed, or left in the field unserviced, over winter. No consistent areas of no bait-take were identified. Further statistical analysis of bait-take data revealed that bait-take was higher in bait stations within 150 m of the treatment edge than interior bait stations. Bait-take in broadleaf/tawa/podocarp forest was significantly higher than in kamahi/kanuka/rewarewa, beech and cloud-cap forest. The second aim of the study was to determine the efficacy of the various bait types with different active ingredients used during the operation. Rat monitoring data, namely rat tracking indices (RTI) obtained from tracking tunnels, were statistically modelled using Generalised Linear Models. Diphacinone cereal pellets (Pestoff&#174; 50D, 0.05g/kg diphacinone) obtained the lowest RTI, followed by pindone cereal pellets (Pindone Pellets&#174;, 0.5g/kg pindone), brodifacoum cereal pellets (Pestoff&#174; 20p and Talon&#174;, 0.02 g/kg brodifacoum), coumatetralyl paste (Racumin&#174;, 0.375 g/kg) and diphacinone bait blocks (Ditrac&#174;, 0.05 g/kg). Cereal pellet baits worked better than any other bait type used at this location. Season had no statistically significant effect on either RTI or bait-take estimates. The overall goal of the poison operation to decrease rat numbers, and to maintain low levels, has been met. However, the results of this study suggest that baiting needs to be done continuously and over the entire treatment area. Edge bait stations &#8211; particularly next to adjacent native forests &#8211; should be prioritised to target reinvading rodents. Poisons presented in cereal pellet baits should be preferred to other bait types. Both pindone and brodifacoum showed very good results, as well as diphacinone in cereal pellet baits.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rodents</field><field name="subject">ship rats</field><field name="subject">Rattus rattus</field><field name="subject">mainland island</field><field name="subject">native forest</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">pest control</field><field name="subject">ground control</field><field name="subject">bait stations</field><field name="subject">bait efficacy</field><field name="subject">brodifacoum</field><field name="subject">pindone</field><field name="subject">diphacinone</field><field name="subject">coumatetralyl</field><field name="subject">warfarin</field><field name="subject">cholecalciferol</field><field name="subject">1080</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1082</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal confusion: virtuality and utopian space : an exegesis presented with exhibition as fulfillment of the requirements for thesis, Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Trevelyan, Peter Ross</field><field name="description">This exegesis details an investigation into the history and evolution of certain technologies, (binary coding, Platonic cosmology, and the linear perspective system) and the extent to which these technologies have distorted or appropriated our perceptions of reality.

Therapeutic benefits of probiotic bacteria have been shown previously, but the molecular mechanisms and the health-promoting effector components involved are still being elucidated. Some evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria can competitively adhere to intestinal mucus and displace pathogens. The adherence of probiotic bacteria to human intestinal mucus and cells appears to be mediated, at least in part, by secretome proteins. Secretome proteins-encoding open reading frames can be identified in bacterial genome sequences using bioinformatics. However, functional analysis of the translated secretome is possible only if many secretome proteins are expressed and purified individually. Phage display technology offers a very efficient way to purify and functionally characterise proteins by displaying them on the surface of the bacteriophage. While a phage display system for cloning secretome proteins has been previously reported it is not efficient for enrichment and display of Gram-positive secretome proteins. In this study a new phage display system has been developed and applied in direct selection, identification, expression and purification of Gram-positive Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain HN001 secretome proteins. The new phage display system is based on the requirement of a signal sequence for assembly of sarcosyl-resistant filamentous phage virions. Using this system 89 secretome open reading frames were identified from a library of only 106 clones, performing at least 20-fold more efficiently than the previously reported enrichment method. Seven of the identified secretome proteins are unique for L. rhamnosus HN001.  A L. rhamnosus HN001 shot-gun phage display library was also constructed to capture proteins that mediate adhesion or aggregation, initial steps in establishing host-microbe contact or forming multicellular aggregates, both of which may lead to beneficial effects &#8211; colonisation of the gastro-intestinal tract and exclusion of pathogens. In search for proteins involved in adhesion, a L. rhamnosus HN001 shot-gun phage display library was screened against the human extracellular matrix component fibronectin commonly used as binding target by bacteria that colonise diverse tissues. This screen selected, instead of a fibronectin-binding protein, a protein that binds to avidin, used to immobilise biotinylated fibronectin. Affinity screening of the shot-gun library for binding to L. rhamnosus HN001 cells identified a secretome protein, Lrh33, as an HN001-cell surface binding protein. This protein contains two bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains type 3. Analysis of phage-displayed nested deletions of Lrh33 determined that the proximal (N-terminal) immunoglobulin-like domain is not sufficient for binding; only the constructs displaying both domains demonstrated binding to HN001. Lrh33 does not have any similarity to previously identified Lactobacillus-binding proteins and no match in the NCBI database (at a cutoff value of &gt; e-13), hence it represents potentially a new type of bacterial auto-aggregation protein.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">probiotic bacteria</field><field name="subject">secretome proteins</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology::270301 Bacteriology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/869</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the health human resource development provisions of the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Master of Public Policy, Massey University at Albany</field><field name="creator">Tiongco-Cruda, Beatriz</field><field name="description">Republic Act No. 9173, or the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 enunciates a bevy of incentives under its Health Human Resource Production, Utilization and Development provisions, intended to stem the rising tide of Filipino nurses leaving the country to work overseas. Under Sections 30 to 34 of the Nursing Act, these incentives include the following: (1) upgrading the minimum base salary of nurses from salary grade 10 to 15; (2) establishing a nurse specialty program in government hospitals to upgrade the nurses&#8217; skills whereby recipients of the program are required to work in government hospitals for two years; and (3) the provision of other benefits such as scholarship grants, free medical care, etc. These provisions are the government&#8217;s policy response to mitigate the impact of nurses&#8217; migration and retain an adequate supply of skilled Filipino nurses in the country: This research is a qualitative study that seeks to assess the health human resource development provisions and their implementation and aims to help improve them. This study examines the responsiveness of the provisions to the needs of nurses, and identifies the deficiencies of the provisions by looking into the working conditions of nurses in two Philippine government hospitals. It also examines the processes and the factors affecting the implementation of the provisions. This study employed a combination of four data collection methods: (1) focus group interviews of nurses working in two Philippine government hospitals, (2) key informant interviews of officials of government agencies and private organizations tasked to implement the health human resource development provisions, (3) document analyses, and (4) researcher&#8217;s field notes/journal. The researcher conducted five focus group interviews with a total of 15 nurse participants and 12 key informant interviews.  The nurses are working under conditions of low salaries and heavy workload, that is characterized by low nurse-to-patient ratios in the National and LGU Hospitals. The problems of inadequate nurse staffing, large number iii of patients and inadequate supplies in the two government hospitals are identified as causes for the heavy workload of nurses. The nurses want a salary increase that is commensurate to their heavy workload, their professional qualifications and long years of service. For the nurses, a salary increase signifies the government&#8217;s recognition of their dedication, hard work, and commitment to provide health care to Filipinos despite working under dire circumstances. The nurse specialty training program in areas such as oncology, nephrology, critical care, etc. has not been implemented because of the limited capacities of government hospitals to provide this kind of training and the lack of regulatory framework for the practice of nurse specialists in the Philippines. The other benefits have not been implemented as well. The provisions of the Nursing Act are deficient because they do not address the causes of the heavy workload of nurses. To improve the work conditions of nurses, the Philippine government needs to prioritize to the long neglected health sector by increasing the budgetary allocation in order to create more nurse positions in government hospitals, to provide adequate supplies and equipment for government hospitals and to improve the facilities for nurses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filipino nurses</field><field name="subject">government hospitals</field><field name="subject">nurses' working conditions</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/870</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of the ASEAN trade dispute settlement mechanism: from diplomacy to legalism</field><field name="creator">Koesrianti, Koesrianti, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the late twentieth century international trade moved from a political multi-polar system based on the nation-state to a system featuring unified regional trading regimes. An inevitable feature of increased cooperation through bilateral, regional and international arrangements is the emergence of disputes over the interpretation and implementation of the agreed upon commitments. Accordingly, reliable mechanisms for the settlement of trade related disputes have become necessary to ensure the effective and continued functioning of these arrangements. Over the years these dispute settlement mechanisms have evolved from the relatively simple, diplomacy based structures called for in the GATT, to the detailed, legalistic, adjudication based mechanism found in the WTO. Bilateral and regional initiatives, such as NAFTA and MERCOSUR, as well as the EU, have similarly adopted dispute settlement mechanisms which adopt, in varying degrees, legalistic adjudicatory processes. Since 1967 ASEAN has spearheaded the creation of a regional trading bloc in the South East Asian region. As in other trading blocs, this has inevitable led to the need to develop effective and workable dispute settlement mechanisms. This thesis examines the development of trade dispute settlement mechanisms in ASEAN tracing its development from a model based on pragmatic diplomacy to a legalistic adjudicatory system with particular reference to the ASEAN context. It examines the extent to which the ASEAN context has influenced the content and the adoption of trade dispute settlement mechanisms in the region, as well as the extent to which the recently adopted 2004 Enhanced Protocol on Dispute Settlement can adequately address trade disputes in the region while remaining sensitive and responsive to the ASEAN context. Based on a comparative examination of dispute settlement mechanisms in other trade agreements, a range of key procedural issues are identified and examined with a view to identifying the prospects and challenges which ASEAN faces in the implementation of its dispute settlement mechanism.

Semiconducting properties have been determined using simultaneous measurements of two independent electrical properties, including electrical conductivity, ??, and thermoelectric power, S, at elevated temperatures (1073-1323 K) in the gas phase of controlled oxygen activity (10-10 Pa &amp;lt p(O2) &amp;lt 75 kPa). Measurements of s and S were conducted (i) in the gas/solid equilibrium and (ii) during equilibration. Oxygen vacancies have been identified as the predominant defects in TiO2 over a wide range of p(O2). Individual conductivity components related to electrons, electron holes and ions, were determined from the obtained ?? data. The effect of p(O2) on these individual components was considered in the form of a diagram. This work led to the discovery of the formation and diffusion of Ti vacancies. However, the obtained diffusion data indicate that, in the temperature ranges commonly used in studies of semiconducting properties (1000-1400K), the Ti vacancies concentration is quenched and may thus be assumed constant. In addition it was shown that Ti vacancies in appreciable concentrations form only during prolonged oxidation. It was determined that the discrepancies in the reported n-p transition point are related to the concentration and spectrum of impurities as well as the concentration of Ti vacancies. It has been shown that the n-p transition point in high-purity TiO2 is determined by the Ti vacancy concentration. A well defined chemical diffusion coefficient, Dchem, was determined using kinetic data obtained during equilibration. A complex relationship between p(O2) and Dchem was observed. These data showed a good agreement between the obtained diffusion data and defect disorder. Examination of the determined equilibration kinetics, led to the discovery of two kinetic regimes, the result of the transport of defects at different mobilities. The determined data are considered well defined due to the following reasons: 1. The studied specimen was of exceptionally high purity and free of grain boundaries (single crystal) 2. The specimen was studied in the gas phase of controlled and well defined oxygen activity which was continuously monitored. 3. Whenever the experimental data were measured in equilibrium, the gas/solid equilibrium has been verified experimentally. 4. A good agreement between the two, self-confirmatory, electrical properties, including ?? and S has been determined simultaneously and independently. The defect disorder model derived in the present work may be used for tailoring controlled semiconducting properties through the selection of annealing conditions involving the temperature and oxygen activity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Semiconductors</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide cristals</field><field name="subject">Metallic oxides -- Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Electric conductivity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27223</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manifestations of fundamental symmetry violation in solids: a theoretical approach</field><field name="creator">Mukhamedjanov, Timur, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Measurements of atomic parity violation provide important cross-tests of the standard model of electroweak interactions by probing these interactions in the domain of low energies. The effects of parity nonconservation in atoms, both dependent and not dependent on nuclear spin, have been successfully measured in experiments. The existence of permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of a quantum particle requires that fundamental parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries are violated. By the CPT theorem, this would mean violation of the combined CP (charge conjugation-parity) symmetry as well. Studies of T and CP violation in nature provide valuable information for theories of baryogenesis, and for understanding of fundamental interactions in general. Recently, a new wave of experiments has been initiated to measure the effects of P and T violation in solid state materials. The possibility to substantially increase the experimental sensitivity lies in the larger number of particles compared to the atomic experiments and in the specific collective effects in solids. The downside is the typically larger level of systematics. In the present work, the following effects due to violation of T and P at fundamental level in solids are considered: (a) effects due to the nuclear weak charge (violation of P) in rare-earth trifluorides, a possibility exists to measure the Weinberg angle with high precision; (b) effects due to the nuclear anapole moment (nuclear spin-dependent violation of P) in praseodymium and thulium garnets, the NMR-type experiments can possibly be used to measure nuclear anapole moments of Pr and Tm; (c) effects due to the electron EDM in gadolinium garnets, increase of the experimental sensitivity to the electron EDM of several orders of magnitude is possible; (d) effects due to the nuclear Schiff moment of 207Pb in ferroelectric lead-titanate; this possibility looks particularly promising, offering a potential 10 orders of magnitude increase of sensitivity to the nuclear Schiff moment, which puts the standard model prediction for this value within experimental reach. Also discussed are several other possibilities for experimental observation of these effects and the impact of some possible systematic effects on the proposed measurements.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">symmetry violation in solids</field><field name="subject">electron EDM</field><field name="subject">nuclear anapole moment</field><field name="subject">Weinberg angle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28206</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical simulation of fracture in unreinforced masonry</field><field name="creator">Chaimoon, Krit, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis are to study the fracture behaviour in unreinforced masonry, to carry out a limited experimental program on three-point bending (TPB) masonry panels and to develop a time-dependent fracture formulation for the study of mode I fracture in quasi-brittle materials. 	A micro-model for fracture in unreinforced masonry is developed using the concept of the discrete crack approach. All basic masonry failure modes are taken into account. To capture brick diagonal tensile cracking and masonry crushing, a linear compression cap is proposed with a criterion for defining the compression cap. The failure surface for brick and brick-mortar interfaces are modelled using a Mohr-Coulomb failure surface with a tension cut-off and a linear compression cap. The fracture formulation, in nonholonomic rate form within a quasi-prescribed displacement approach, is based on a piecewise-linear constitutive law and is in the form of a so-called ?linear complementarity problem? (LCP). The proposed model has been applied to simulating fracture in masonry shear walls and masonry TPB panels. 	An experimental program was undertaken to investigate the failure behaviour of masonry panels under TPB with relatively low strength mortar. The basic material parameters were obtained from compression, TPB and shear tests on bricks, mortar and brick-mortar interfaces. The experimental results showed that the failure of masonry TPB panels is governed by both tensile and shear failure rather than just tensile failure. The simulation of the masonry TPB tests compared well with the experimental results. 	In addition, the LCP fracture formulation is enhanced to study the time-dependent mode I fracture in quasi-brittle materials. Two main time-dependent sources, the viscoelasticity of the bulk material and the crack rate dependent opening, are taken into account. A simplified crack rate model is proposed to include the rate-dependent crack opening. The model is applied to predicting time-dependent crack growth in plain concrete beams under sustained loading. The model captures the essential features including the observed strength increase with loading rate, the load-deflection and load-CMOD responses, the deflection-time and CMOD-time curves, the predicted time to failure and the stress distributions in the fracture zone.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masonry.</field><field name="subject">Masonry -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Fracture mechanics -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Interface model.</field><field name="subject">Linear complementarity problem.</field><field name="subject">Compression cap.</field><field name="subject">Creep.</field><field name="subject">Crack rate dependency.</field><field name="subject">Finite element.</field><field name="subject">Fracture.</field><field name="subject">Softening.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40757</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbo-generator responses due to the Alford force, the steam excitation force and the dominant unbalanced magnetic pull</field><field name="creator">Cai, Zhemin, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In turbomachinery, extra excitation forces may result from non-idealised operation conditions and may sometime cause excessive vibrations and unsteady rotor motions. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the effects of such excitation forces.  The extra excitation forces investigated here are the Thomas/Alford force due to the blade tip clearance change, the steam excitation force caused by the variation of inlet steam speed and state blade trailing wake and the dominant magnetic pull force due to dynamic eccentricity of the rotor. The main research results in this thesis include: (1)	The modelling of the Jeffcott rotor and the 600MW steam-turbine generator. The used in-house ??transient?? program can only handle the circular short bearings with the modified short bearing method while the simulated steam-turbine should be supported by tilting pad bearings. The first critical speeds of systems supported by tilting pad bearings are more approaching to the lab data for all four rotor models while that of journal bearing supported systems are normally lower than the real operating critical speed. (2)	Applying three sorts of excitation forces into the single-stage rotor-bearing system. The numerical simulation shows that for the model with each single excitation force, all of these three forces need to reach some limit to force the system into the unsteady state. For all the three forces, higher limits are needed if the machine runs at lower running speeds. Furthermore, unbalance loading also can influence the system behaviours. As the unbalance increases, the system will still stay steady while the spectra become noisier, though the amplitude still low comparing to harmonics.  (3)	Combing three types of excitation forces into the assembled rotor-bearing system. The numerical simulation shows that the assembled system presents similar vibration responses as the single stage rotor-bearing system. Furthermore, these three forces cannot cancel each other and the combination will unstabilise the system. Meanwhile, the influence of the dominant magnetic pull force is less than other two forces.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dominant magnetic pull force</field><field name="subject">Thomas/Alford Force</field><field name="subject">Steam excitation force</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43544</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voluntary Disclosure and the Role of Product Market Competition: A Study of Disclosures in Press Releases by U.S. Companies</field><field name="creator">Ramaswami, Narayanaswamy, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">A firm provides voluntary disclosures to the financial market in order to guide the valuation of its shares by mitigating adverse selection. However, voluntary disclosures could cause detriment to the disclosing firm's prospects, as the firm's competitors in the product market observe the disclosures. Prior analytical research has conflicting positions about the role of product market competition in voluntary disclosure. One view (Verrecchia 1983) is that competitive disadvantage resulting from the existence of proprietary costs discourages firms in high competition industries from providing voluntary disclosures. Another view (Darrough and Stoughton 1990) is that firms provide voluntary disclosures to deter potential rivals from entering the industry. This paper examines the association between voluntary disclosure and product market competition after controlling for firm size, analyst following, firm performance, and access to external financing. It looks at disclosures in press releases, an issue that is relatively unexplored, even though press releases have become one of the most important channels of communication in the United States. A total of 5,587 press releases by 156 U.S. firms in 1998 are studied. Product market competition is measured by the Herfindahl- Hirschman Index. It is found that the firms in high competition industries provide, on average, greater voluntary disclosures than the firms in low competition industries. The results are found to be robust to revisions in the specification of the model and modifications in the sample.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disclosure in accounting -- United States</field><field name="subject">Competition -- United States</field><field name="subject">Disclosure of information -- United States</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18643</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanisms of composite fouling in Australian sugar mill evaporators by calcium oxalate and amorphous silica</field><field name="creator">Yu, Hong, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Deposition of amorphous silica (SiO2) and calcium oxalate (CaOx) on the calandria tubes of juice evaporators cause serious processing problems in Australian cane sugar mills. The removal of these deposits by mechanical and chemical means is a timeconsuming and costly experience. The cost of downtime and chemical cleaning can be several million dollars per year for the Australian sugar industry. The interactions between CaOx and SiO2 have not been investigated previously because conventional studies only address fouling by individual components. The present work evaluates their interactions using two experimental approaches: batch tests for assessing kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour, and fouling-loop experiments for examining composite fouling behaviour under different operating conditions. The above two approaches were employed both in the absence and in the presence of sugar to elucidate the effect of sugar on composite fouling mechanisms and to determine the controlling species responsible for composite fouling. The composite fouling experiments were performed in a novel closed-loop circulation system simulating the effect of feed composition of successive stages of evaporation cycle in a single run. In addition, the fouling-loop system was operated in a constant composition mode to study the effects of thermal hydraulic conditions on composite fouling. The combined information obtained from both the batch and fouling-loop tests in this study offer a unique insight into the mechanisms of composite fouling of CaOx and SiO2. Some of the highlights of the obtained results are as follows: ??? Identification of a complex interactive process in calcium oxalate monohydrate ??? silica (COM-SiO2) systems by investigation of the kinetics and thermodynamics of COM-SiO2 coprecipitation in water and sugar solutions, and an understanding of the mechanisms of these interactions; ??? Development of a novel fouling-loop system, which is simple, efficient and cost effective for the study of the effect of juice composition on scale formation in various stages of juice evaporation; ??? Elucidation of composite fouling mechanisms, e.g., a feed composition dependent fouling mechanism is proposed; ??? Isolation and verification of the existence of certain species in composite deposits, which is known to be thermodynamically unstable. In other words, it is established that calcium oxalate trihydrate is stable under certain conditions; ??? Evaluation of the role of thermal hydraulic operating parameters in determining the characteristics of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer and in determining the strength of the composite deposit; ??? Development and validation of an empirical model to predict the subcooled flow boiling heat transfer coefficients in water and sugar solutions; ??? Development of an analytical model incorporating the effects of operating parameters for COM and SiO2 composite fouling in sugar solutions. This model predicted the experimental data better than available models. Results of this work are significant, not only because they have made a valuable contribution to advance the fundamental understanding of heat exchanger fouling, but also because they may play a key role in the development of scale control and removal strategies to minimize the composite fouling in Australian sugar mill evaporators. For example it was found that, in order to effectively minimize the rate of composite fouling and reduce the scale tenacity, it would be necessary to control thermal hydraulic operating conditions, especially the fluid velocity, and to adjust the initial CaOx/SiO2 supersaturation ratio to the optimum value. To achieve the optimal CaOx/SiO2 ratio, certain device can be developed to sequentially measure oxalic acid and SiO2 concentrations in juice so that the correct proportions of chemicals can be added. Model simulations of the composite fouling rate may also effectively and economically provide comparative and relevant information essential for process optimisation and evaporator design</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calcium oxalate</field><field name="subject">Sugar</field><field name="subject">Manufacture and refining</field><field name="subject">Silica</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20527</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subject cultures and pedagogy: Comparing mathematics and science</field><field name="creator">Darby, Linda Maree</field><field name="description">Teaching a subject requires a teacher to understand its language, epistemology and traditions, and how these characteristics govern what is appropriate for teaching and learning. This research examines how teachers' experiences of mathematics and science subject cultures, including traditions of practice, beliefs, and basic assumptions, influence their secondary school mathematics and science teaching. 

Six teachers from two secondary schools were interviewed and their classroom practice observed over a period of eighteen months. The research involved observing and video recording teachers' mathematics and science lessons, then interviewing them about their practice, their views of school mathematics and science, and how they see themselves in relation to these subjects. 

Four themes emerged which highlight similarities and differences between the subject cultures of mathematics and science: the nature of curriculum organisation across the two subjects; the role of learning experientially through hands-on experiences; the translation of 'relevance' as a school culture imperative into teachers' conceptions of, and practices in, the subject; and the role of aesthetic understanding in how teachers experience, situate themselves within, and negotiate boundaries between the two subject cultures.

Significant cultural and individual differences were found in what teachers considered to be at the core of their subject teaching. Cultural differences make the subject identifiably mathematics or science. In mathematics, supporting students to move through sequentially organised curriculum content, and the importance placed on mathematics in the school curriculum, led to a Pedagogy of Support. In science, the more topic-based curriculum, and an imperative to foster student interest in science, led to a Pedagogy of Engagement. A school culture imperative to link the subject matter to students' lives was translated differently in mathematics and science. 

Individual differences between teachers resulted in a diversity of practices across and within the two schools, particularly with respect to how teachers related practical work to theory. The two schools' different approaches to open-ended problem solving resulted in varying degrees of latitude for teachers to move away from traditional teaching modes. In addition, whether or not teachers had stories to tell that related the subject matter to students' lives influenced their approach to making the subject relevant. Teachers' passions, coherence in their understanding of content and pedagogy, and their identity, were shown to be integral to the way they positioned themselves in relation to the subject, and in shaping their confidence and competence.

Teachers experienced different traditions within the subject cultures. Some traditions perpetuated practices that might be considered 'outdated'. Emerging traditions challenged current practices through innovation and new ways of thinking about teaching and learning. Local traditions developed within the school as expectations for practice. Teachers experienced these different traditions in the process of moving forward from basic assumptions that they saw as characterising the subject, while translating school culture imperatives, and as they developed a sense of self in relation to the subject. 

The significance of this research lies in its contribution to improved understanding of the demands associated with subject teaching. Findings relating to the demands associated with negotiating subject boundaries have implications for the support of teachers who are teaching 'out-of-field'. In addition, teachers' experiences of the demands associated with translating school culture imperatives into their subject teaching raise questions about the usefulness of generic descriptions of pedagogy. These findings indicate that teacher and school change processes can be informed by describing subject and individual pedagogies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subject culture</field><field name="subject">pedagogy</field><field name="subject">science education</field><field name="subject">mathematics education</field><field name="identifier">http://tux.lib.deakin.edu.au./adt-VDU/public/adt-VDU20090531.233237</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Papillomatosis and carcinomatosis in the western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville)</field><field name="creator">L.Woolford@rvc.ac.uk</field><field name="description">Conservation efforts to prevent the extinction of the endangered western barred bandicoot Perameles bougainville (WBB) are currently hindered by a debilitating progressive papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Now extinct on mainland Australia, wild populations of the WBB are known only to exist on Bernier and Dorre Islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia. This thesis describes and analyses the pathological (gross, histological, ultrastructural) and immunohistochemical features of a papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the WBB. The detection and characterisation of a novel virus, the bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus type 1 (BPCV1), found in association with cutaneous and muco-cutaneous papillomas and carcinomas, is described. BPCV1 was found to exhibit genomic and morphological features of both the Papillomaviridae and the Polyomaviridae, and may represent the first member of a new family of viruses. The findings of this study provide evidence that BPCV1 is the causative agent of the papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome. Clinical, pathological and molecular evidence of the syndrome and BPCV1 were found in the Bernier Island WBB population at Red Cliff and in captive populations comprising all or a proportion of founder WBBs from this site, but not at all in the WBB population on Dorre Island or Heirisson Prong. The papillomatosis and carcinomatosis syndrome in the western barred bandicoot is a pertinent example of a disease process hampering efforts to prevent the extinction of an endangered species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090512.53806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural network classification based on quantification of uncertainty</field><field name="creator">P.Kraipeerapun@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with feedforward backpropagation neural networks and interval neutrosophic sets for the binary and multiclass classification problems. Neural networks are used to predict &#147;true&#148; and &#147;false&#148; output values. These results together with the uncertainty of type error and vagueness occurred in the prediction are then represented in the form of interval neutrosophic sets. Each element in an interval neutrosophic set consists of three membership values: truth, indeterminacy, and false. These three membership values are then used in the classification process. For binary classification, a pair of neural networks is first applied in order to predict the degrees of truth and false membership values. Subsequently, bagging technique is applied to an ensemble of pairs of neural networks in order to improve the performance. For multiclass classification, two basic multiclass classification methods are proposed. A pair of neural networks with multiple outputs and multiple pairs of binary neural network are experimented. A number of aggregation techniques are proposed in this thesis. The difference between each pair of the truth and false membership values determines the vagueness value. Error occurred in the prediction are estimated using an interpolation technique. Both vagueness and error then form the indeterminacy membership. Two and three dimensional visualization of the three membership values are also presented. Ten data sets obtained from UCI machine learning repository are experimented with the proposed approaches.

The &#145;traditional&#146; full time permanent job is no longer available to many people.

This project examines aspects of the personal and work lives of casual TAFE lecturers in the Perth metropolitan area. It provides a specific case study of workers who have been affected by the changes in the workforce which have developed over the past 25 years. In particular, these are workers who, given their tertiary education and work experience, would not necessarily have expected to be employed on a casual basis but who are now part of the roughly 27% of the workforce employed in this mode.

Supporters of the restructured workforce claim that work flexibility has advantages for the economy and for both the employer and the employee and argue that many are happy to work in this mode. This project seeks to test this assertion, to examine briefly the economic and political features that led to casual work being adopted as the preferred employment model at TAFE in Western Australia, and to consider in detail its consequences for some of those employed in this manner.

Through a series of interviews of 40 casual TAFE lecturers it investigates some of the particular features of such employment; such as how people obtain and maintain work, and whether they regard themselves as having a career, as well as looking at broader aspects such as stigma, insecurity and the place of risk in the workplace. The research reveals that while this mode of employment suits a subset of casual employees, others pine for greater security and certainty in their working lives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">casual work</field><field name="subject">TAFE lecturers</field><field name="subject">casual employment</field><field name="subject">workforce change</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090526.110829</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's experiences, social support and adapting to the offshore lifestyle : my life, my house, my bed..., not my life, shared house, shared bed, shared..., to get yourself back into sharing, because it takes a bit to work out the two</field><field name="creator">watsone@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">In the past two decades the growth of the offshore oil and gas industry of Western Australia has resulted in an increased number of families experiencing the intermittent absence of a partner/parent. The gendered nature of the offshore oil and gas industry means workers tend to be male and the partner left at home tends to be female. This was the case for the participants in this study. For two/three weeks the family experience the absence of the male 'breadwinner', creating a gap within the family as the women and children experiences the loss of the partner/parent. Two/three weeks later the male worker returns home for his rest period and he reengages in his roles and the family is reunited. When the worker is absent the partner at home takes on the worker's gendered roles, tasks and responsibilities; upon his return she surrenders (sometimes willingly) his gendered roles, tasks and responsibilities.

Solheim (1988) state families of offshore oil and gas workers experience three social realities; his life at work, her 'single' life when he is at work, and their couple life when the worker arrives home. The families can develop a range of methods to adjust to the flux that occurs within families due to the work schedule (Forsyth and Gramling 1989). The repeated cyclical patterns of parting and reunion, weaving and balancing their three lives, and renegotiation of family work contribute to the stressors and strains the partners of offshore workers experience.

This study investigated how the offshore lifestyle impacts the at home partner of offshore workers and in addition, how at home partners use their social networks as means to help adapt to the offshore work schedule, and makes two major findings. Firstly, the at home partners of offshore workers participate in exchanging, at various levels, social support with family, friends and neighbours, although the most important form of support which helps the at home partner adapt to the offshore lifestyle is the support they receive from the offshore worker. Secondly, adapting to the offshore lifestyle is highly influenced by a process consisting of four reactions. The reactions are: the beginning; normalising his presence; normalising his absence; and balancing two lives. The identification of the four reactions can provide a greater understanding of how the offshore oil and gas industry impacts on the daily lives of partners of offshore workers as it helps make visible the day-to-day lives of partners of offshore oil and gas workers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Work and family</field><field name="subject">Job stress</field><field name="subject">Shift systems</field><field name="subject">Fly in/Fly out</field><field name="subject">families</field><field name="subject">adapting to FIFO lifestyle</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090527.105256</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">State Building or State Transformation? Risk Management at the Fringes of the Global Order</field><field name="creator">S.Hameiri@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a new framework for explaining the effects and possible trajectories of state building interventions (SBIs). This is for both examining specific interventions and learning about the precise nature of the post-Cold War global order &#150; how power is distributed, exercised, constrained and challenged within and between states.

In the post-Cold War years, but particularly since the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, so-called failed states have become a central security concern for policymakers. In tandem, there has been an influx of practitioner and scholarly interest in international &#145;state building&#146;. Prevalent approaches to state building are premised on a static conception of the state and therefore seek to evaluate SBIs in terms of whether they help create &#145;more&#146; or &#145;less&#146; state. In contrast, this thesis examines SBIs as a new mode of governance in the global political economy that is transformative of both intervened and intervening states, leading to the creation of a transnationalising and transnationally regulated form of statehood. Based on a conception of the state as a site of social and political struggle this study examines the ways in which SBIs affect the distribution, production and reproduction of political power in intervened states: Who rules and how? What social and political conflicts are engendered or exacerbated by SBIs, and how are they managed? What alliances and coalitions support the production/reproduction of power relationships associated with SBIs?
 
The thesis provides a conceptual framework for understanding the complex governance terrain SBIs open up. SBIs are conceptualised as multilevel regimes &#150; sets of social and political relationships, institutions and ideas &#150; that exist simultaneously within and outside intervened states. While preserving the formal sovereignty of intervened states, these regimes are nevertheless established to shape political outcomes by limiting the political choices available to domestic leaders. This is operationalised by opening up and shifting power to multilevel spaces of governance within the apparatus of these countries. Through case studies from Australia, Solomon Islands and Cambodia, the thesis analyses the politics of SBIs and their broader implications for contemporary statehood. Ultimately it establishes that regardless of whether SBIs are successful or otherwise in achieving their stated objectives they are associated with the emergence of increasingly authoritarian, hierarchical and anti-competitive forms of political rule, both within and between states.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">state building</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">the state</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090528.133941</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turning road (Fiction) Bluebeard in Shirley Hazzard&#146;s the transit of Venus (Critical Accompaniment)</field><field name="creator">tristanstein@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">This is a thesis comprising two components: a portion of my novella and a dissertation.

The second component is the critical essay, which considers the extent to which Australian women&#146;s expatriate fiction can be read as a variation of Bluebeard.

It is my contention that reading Bluebeard in The Transit of Venus highlights issues of identity and power in relation to gender and nation.

This paper compares the ideas set by society about the process of becoming an adult and the real life events that triggered this transition period in this particular group of girls.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photographic documentary</field><field name="subject">teenage transition</field><field name="subject">young adulthood</field><field name="subject">self-realisation</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20090603.134738</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talent Quest: Advanced Business Services and the Geography of Innovation</field><field name="creator">Spiller, Marcus Luigi</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates whether the tendency for Advanced Business Services to concentrate in Sydney and Melbourne implies a similar spatial bias in the propensity for innovation across the Australian economy.       The various models of business innovation are reviewed. The traditional Schumpeterian view is characterized by a strategic leap in customer offer, based on some new break-through technology. Alternatively, innovation may proceed in incremental or organic fashion. Other conceptual frameworks for analyzing innovation conceive of it as a network process, which is becoming more prevalent as corporate value chains 'unbundle' with improved communication technologies, reduced barriers to capital transfers and new techniques for managing transaction risk.      Regardless of which model of innovation is applied, Advanced Business Services have a critical role in sparking and facilitating innovation. This is gathering potency as the 'thinking part' of the value chain becomes increasingly separable from the 'making' and 'distribution' aspects of production.       While Advanced Business Services are vital to successful innovation in the modern economy, they continue to operate within primitive commercial models where social networks and trust based relationships are paramount in successful client service. The innovation catalyst function of Advanced Business Services may be prone to a significant distance deterioration effect, because of the difficulty of maintaining the requisite social relationships over an extended geography. This, in turn, suggests an emergent core and periphery geography in innovation.       The thesis examines this hypothesis through both demand and supply side analyses. The latter involves a random sample survey of approximately 100 Advanced Business Service firms in Melbourne. This confirms the tendency of these firms to favour local clients.       The demand side analysis includes case studies of Advanced Business Service use and innovation outcomes amongst six metropolitan Melbourne based firms and six similar firms based some two hours drive away in Bendigo. In line with the hypothesis, the metropolitan cases show much stronger engagement with knowledge intensive advisory services than their counterparts in regional Victoria.       The demand side analysis also includes a quantitative component, which is exploratory in nature owing to data limitations. It considers how innovation outcomes in manufacturing change with increasing distance from key Advanced Business Service centres. Innovation outcomes are proxied by variations in manufacturing worker wages. These results are also consistent with the hypothesis of distance deterioration in the innovation role of Advanced Business Services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field

three-phase electrical power systems under non-sinusoidal and nonlinear conditions</field><field name="creator">Khalsa, Harnaak Singh</field><field name="description">There is a need for generalised definitions of electrical powers to provide a simultaneous common base for measurement, compensation, power quality and identification of source of distortion.  The major problem area today is definitions of powers in the presence of harmonics and nonlinear loads in the electrical power system. In such a scenario, there is a problem to accurately measure especially reactive (nonactive) power. This is important for accurate energy billing. Another important area is the mitigation equipment used to remove unwanted polluting quantities from the power system. Definitions of powers have an important role to play in providing the correct information for the optimal design and performance of such equipment. Evaluation of the quality of the power system to enable appropriate allocation costs to those causing deterioration in the power quality also cannot be discounted. To enable this cost allocation, there is a need to identify the polluters and the definitions should indicate degradation in power quality as well as identify the source of this degradation. Finally, it would be very useful if the definitions could also be used to perform a general analysis of the power system.  This thesis commenced with investigation of the problem with an in-depth study of the existing definitions, and what other researchers have indicated about this problem, from the definitions perspective. The issues identified with current definitions are that some definitions do not possess the attributes that are related to source-load properties, and others are based on mathematical consideration and lack physical meaning. One issue in measurement of nonactive power is its nature of having zero average value. Another contributing factor is that the presence of source impedance is neglected in definitions. The use of RMS quantities to determine powers, especially instantaneous powers, in the presence of multi-frequency voltages and currents also contributes to the problem. Additionally, RMS based definitions are based on heating effect while not all sourceload relationships are totally of a heating nature. The RMS based definitions also do not satisfy the energy conservation principle. Another issue is that though harmonic currents are used, current definitions still utilise the RMS value of the voltage wave thus losing harmonic information.  The solution is to decompose, as accurately as possible, the total instantaneous power into active and nonactive components utilising DC, fundamental and harmonics of voltage and current as well as being based on the power system properties. To enable this, the load model must closely represent the reality. This thesis presents the new instantaneous power definitions to achieve this. In addition to the fundamental, five sub-components for each of the active and nonactive parts are defined. The definitions are based on both the voltage and current DC, fundamental and harmonic components thus retaining harmonic information. Thus these definitions are not only mathematically based but also have a direct relationship with the load. The definitions do not make the assumption of zero source impedance. With good knowledge of the time profile of active and nonactive power components, an accurate time-domain measurement of the active and nonactive power is achieved. The components of powers introduced in the proposed definitions can be utilised to gauge power quality, to identify the source of distortion and to achieve optimal compensation. Based on the new instantaneous power definitions, the definitions for average values of the powers are also proposed. The recognition of positive going and negative going parts of the nonactive power waveform in defining the average nonactive power alleviates the problem of the &#8220;zero average nature&#8221; of nonactive power. It also retains energy information and satisfies the principle of energy conservation.  The new definitions are evaluated for linear and non-linear loads in the presence of harmonics using benchmark case studies. Evaluation results demonstrate good performance of the proposed definitions. The practical applications of the definitions are explored with a number of examples from the areas of measurement of power and energy, compensation, detection of source of distortion and power quality. An application example showing the capability of the definitions in general analysis of a system is also presented. Good and useful results are obtained for all these examples. The proposed definitions are implemented on prototype systems with digital signal processors to demonstrate their practical usability. The proposed definitions are shown to be consistent with the traditional definitions under the conventional sinusoidal conditions, and their relationships to the commonly used existing definitions are also revealed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Active</field><field name="subject">Compensation</field><field name="subject">Definitions</field><field name="subject">Electrical power</field><field name="subject">Instantaneous</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Non-active</field><field name="subject">Non-linear</field><field name="subject">Nonsinusoidal</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/42420</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paul Solanges : soldier, industrialist, translator : a biographical study and critical edition of his correspondence with Antonio Fogazzaro and Henry Handel Richardson</field><field name="creator">O&#8217;Neill, Patrick Nathaniel</field><field name="description">Paul Solanges was one of the most prolific (in correspondence) and enthusiastic fans of Australian author Henry Handel Richardson (HHR).

It promises many valuable practical and humanitarian applications. Most localisation methods require a robot to reactively track an odour plume along its entire length. This approach is time consuming and may be not be possible in a cluttered indoor environment, where airflow tends to form sectors of circulating airflow. Such environments may be encountered in crawl-ways under floors, roof cavities, mines, caves, tree-canopies, air-ducts, sewers or tunnel systems. Operation in these places is important for such applications as search and rescue and locating the sources of toxic chemicals in an industrial setting. This thesis addresses odour localisation in this class of environments.  The solution consists of a sense-map-plan-act style control scheme (and low level behaviour based controller) with two main stages. Firstly, the airflow in the environment is modelled using naive physics rules which are encapsulated into an algorithm named a Naive Reasoning Machine. It was used in preference to conventional methods as it is fast, does not require boundary conditions, and most importantly, provides approximate solutions to the degree of accuracy required for the task, with analogical data structures that are readily useful to a reasoning algorithm. Secondly, a reasoning algorithm navigates the robot to specific target locations that are determined with a physical map, the airflow map, and knowledge of odour dispersal. Sensor measurements at the target positions provide information regarding the likelihood that odour was emitted from potential odour source locations. The target positions and their traversal are determined so that all the potential odour source sites are accounted for. The core method provides values corresponding to the confidence that the odour source is located in a given region. A second search stage exploiting vision is then used to locate the specific location of the odour source within the predicted region. This comprises the second part of a bi-modal, two-stage search, with each stage exploiting complementary sensing modalities. Single hypothesis airflow modelling faces limitations due to the fact that large differences between airflow topologies are predicted for only small variations in a physical map. This is due to uncertainties in the map and approximations in the modelling process. Furthermore, there are uncertainties regarding the flow direction through inlet/outlet ducts. A method is presented for dealing with these uncertainties, by generating multiple airflow hypotheses. As the robot performs odour localisation, airflow in the environment is measured and used to adjust the confidences of the hypotheses using Bayesian inference. The best hypothesis is then selected, which allows the completion of the localisation task. This method improves the robustness of odour localisation in the presence of uncertainties, making it possible where the single hypothesis method would fail. It also demonstrates the potential for integrating naive physics into a statistical framework. Extensive experimental results are presented to support the methods described above.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Odour localisation</field><field name="subject">Odor localization</field><field name="subject">Autonomous robots</field><field name="subject">Robots -- Control systems</field><field name="subject">Airflow</field><field name="subject">Naive physics</field><field name="subject">Folk physics</field><field name="subject">Multiple hypothesis</field><field name="subject">Bayesian</field><field name="subject">Complementary sensing</field><field name="subject">Bimodal search</field><field name="subject">Mobile robots</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/53471</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality in higher education: stories of English and Czech academics and higher education leaders</field><field name="creator">Mertova, Patricie</field><field name="description">The subject of quality has been a pervasive issue on the agenda in higher education around the world for more than a decade. A greater focus on quality in higher education resulted from a range of competing factors, among the most prominent were: political control over higher education (exerted particularly by national governments), the growth in the number of students in higher education (including general changes in the student population and their expectations) and financial control on the part of national governments (frequently related to the previous two factors).  Quality monitoring has become a mechanism for governments worldwide to tackle these competing factors. However, at the same time, it can be argued that it was frequently employed to disguise the dominant focus on accountability in higher education rather than on enhancement. Many of the quality assurance models and systems applied to higher education originated in the business and manufacturing sectors. They have often been found unsuitable or only partially suitable for the higher education sector, because they largely disregarded the nature of higher education and its employees, in particular the academics.  It may be argued that the quality movement has driven higher education more towards greater uniformity, which may be detrimental to what was understood as the &#8220;real&#8221; quality in higher education. For instance, innovation was regarded as an important aspect of academic work. Nevertheless, the present quality development drive seems to be working against the nature of academic work.  Given this background, it is alarming that the academic voice seems to have had little impact to date on the development of quality systems in higher education. Therefore, the present thesis attempted to investigate the academic voice concerning higher education quality.  Overall, this thesis had two main objectives. First, based on the analysis of stories of academics and higher education leaders, the thesis endeavoured to construct a framework of significant quality issues for the potential use in future policy development in higher education in the two countries investigated in this research (the Czech Republic and England), and prospectively in other higher education systems around the world. In particular, it aimed to introduce more human-centred measures into the area of higher education quality. Second, in terms of developing a methodology, the thesis attempted to illustrate the way in which a critical event narrative inquiry study of heterogeneous and complex environments, such as higher education, could be undertaken.  Employing such a critical event narrative inquiry approach, the researcher endeavoured to highlight important aspects of higher education quality, which have been largely overlooked in the area, and thus assist the improvement of the practice of quality development in higher education. The study utilised face-to-face interviews with academics and higher education leaders concerning their perceptions of the issue of higher education quality.  The researcher anticipated that eliciting of &#8220;critical events&#8221; through interviews with individuals involved in the area of quality in higher education (academics and higher education leaders) would uncover some important aspects in higher education quality which would not be revealed using other more traditional empirical methods of inquiry, particularly quantitative research methods.  To investigate the area of higher education quality, the researcher elected to look into the English and Czech higher education systems. The choice of the English higher education system was influenced by the knowledge that England, and more generally the UK, was among the first countries in the world, and certainly the first in Europe, to introduce a formal quality assurance system into higher education. Australia followed this trend soon after it was introduced in the UK. The researcher elected the Czech higher education system, as a culturally different educational system, distinctive from the Anglo-Saxon educational tradition, and which is uniquely placed on the divide between Western and Eastern Europe. In this respect, the critical event narrative inquiry method was proposed as a suitable method for the investigation of significant aspects of cultural difference.  Employing the critical event narrative inquiry method, the researcher uncovered a number of significant issues. Some of these issues were identified by English and Czech academics and higher education leaders as not featuring strongly in their countries&#8217; current higher education quality enhancement practices, and yet they were regarded as important by the academics. Some of the issues uncovered in this research, on the other hand, were highlighted as impacting negatively on the quality enhancement processes in their respective higher education systems. There were a number of issues which were identified as common to both the English and Czech higher education systems. These issues might have been an indication of potential wider relevance of such trends among a broader range of higher education systems worldwide.  This thesis proposed a framework for a human-centred approach to quality enhancement in higher education based on issues which were common to both English and Czech higher education systems. This framework featured: &#8226;	Regard for the academic voice in higher education quality policy development; &#8226;	Attention to human-centred aspects of higher education quality; &#8226;	Need for a collegial approach and reflection on the purposes of quality evaluation processes; &#8226;	Equal value afforded to teaching and research; and &#8226;	Focus on innovation and change.  There were also some culture-specific issues uncovered, particularly in relation to the Czech higher education system. These culture-specific issues may be relevant to certain common trends and features in other higher education systems in Central and Eastern European regions. In this respect, the thesis proposed a framework for a human-centred approach to quality enhancement with regard to culture-specific issues. The framework focused specifically on Czech higher education and may be of potential relevance to other Central and Eastern European higher education systems. This framework included: &#8226;	The significance of transparency in educational processes; &#8226;	The need for a fundamental change in the style of pedagogy in higher education institutions; to focus more on thinking processes and reasoning; &#8226;	The need for a more systematic move towards a student-centred approach across the whole higher education system; &#8226;	The need to address the factor of pressure on Czech academics to publish mainly in English in order to receive international recognition; and &#8226;	The need for education of Czech academic staff to enable a broader and better understanding of the concept of higher education quality in the context of the Czech higher education system.  Investigation of the academic voice in English higher education did not reveal any culture-specific issues. In other words, the English academics and higher education leaders did not identify any issues in higher education quality that were distinctively different from the general issues highlighted also by Czech academics and higher education leaders. Some of the issues pointed out in the English context occurred on a more advanced level due to the different historical, political and socio-economic context of the UK higher education.  It appears that quality in higher education is here to stay. As such, it is essential for the future of higher education that quality enhancement be based on education-focused approaches. Overall, this thesis proposed a human-centred approach to quality enhancement as one way of attaining educational focus.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Higher education quality</field><field name="subject">Academic voice</field><field name="subject">English higher education</field><field name="subject">Czech higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/53585</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the taxation of business profits - especially 'online' profits - in Australia and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Wong, Antonietta Pui-Kwok</field><field name="description">There are two main principles under which jurisdictions tax income &#8211; source and residence. The point of these two principles is to establish a &#8216;nexus&#8217; or link between a taxable transaction, operation or activity and a taxing state. It is this nexus which is used to justify the imposition of taxation by the jurisdiction on a particular taxpayer. Where a taxpayer is a &#8216;resident&#8217; of a jurisdiction, then that person often becomes liable to pay tax on income derived from all sources. Where a taxpayer is a &#8216;nonresident&#8217; of a jurisdiction, then that person often becomes liable to pay tax on income derived from sources within a particular, relevant jurisdiction.  The concept of source of income is fundamentally important to both Australia and Hong Kong. Australia adopts a worldwide tax system that taxes its residents on Australian and foreign income and non-residents on Australian income, whilst Hong Kong adopts a territorial tax system that forgoes taxing foreign income irrespective of who has derived it. The fundamental basis for taxation under a territorial tax system is the source of income; while the fundamental basis for taxation under a worldwide tax system is the concept of residence. In both jurisdictions, the decisions of the courts on the meaning of source have been crucial in defining the concept of &#8216;source of income&#8217; for tax purposes.  The foundations of source-based taxation are less stable today. There is no universal set of source rules that can readily be applied to every circumstance to determine the source or locality of profits. The growth in international trade, supported by the development of electronic commerce, has substantially increased source-related revenue risks. Entities are increasingly able to structure their finances and conduct their affairs without being constrained by geography or national boundaries. Anticipated profits may be shifted to a related party and from one jurisdiction to another to arrive at a reduced overall tax burden. It is becoming increasingly difficult to determine from what and where income originates.  The thesis examines the nature of the current source rules in Australia and Hong Kong and analyses the fundamental adequacy of the source principle generally when confronted, especially, with the challenge of rapidly growing Internet-based commercial activities. Australia and Hong Kong have been chosen for comparative study for the following reasons: the two jurisdictions are good examples of small-medium advanced economies; they are similar in the sense that they are, primarily, knowledge capital-importing jurisdictions; their approaches to &#8216;source&#8217; differ markedly; and these approaches tend towards each end of the &#8216;source spectrum&#8217;.  The thesis identifies certain principal research questions. The basic responses to these questions are: The concept of source of income is, essentially, less clear today in the domestic tax law of Australia and Hong Kong than before. Determining the source of income in Australia and Hong Kong can be a very complex issue. The difficulty related to making such determinations is growing. Searching for the real source of income has become still more problematic with the increase in globalisation and the rapid growth of Internet-based commerce. The traditional concept of source of income has &#8216;lost traction&#8217; as a fundamental basis for effectively imposing income taxation, especially, in today&#8217;s globalised economy. Existing source rules do not deal adequately with certain &#8216;revenue-leakage&#8217; issues confronting us today and, even more, the likely issues of tomorrow. We need to reconsider how we can better address these issues. The thesis establishes that this is so for Australia and Hong Kong. It also reasons that this proposition generally holds true for most developed tax jurisdictions.  The thesis concludes with a detailed review of three of the most prominent optional approaches for addressing the source challenge: (A) a move to a new refundable withholding-tax-based method of taxing cross-border electronic commerce; (B) a shift to far greater reliance on the use of the residence principle of taxation; and (C) a shift to notably greater reliance on (indirect) consumption taxation. Option C, it is argued, offers the best prospects for dealing in the least bad way with the identified issues.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taxation law</field><field name="subject">Business profits</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/56990</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New quantitative methods in analyser-based phase contrast X-ray imaging</field><field name="creator">Vine, David John</field><field name="description">New quantitative methods are developed for analyser-based phase contrast imaging (ABI) with hard X-rays. In the first instance we show that quantitative ABI may be implemented using an extended incoherent source. Next, we outline how complex Green&#8217;s functions may be reconstructed from phase contrast images and we apply this method to reconstruct the thick perfect crystal Green&#8217;s function associated with an ABI imaging system.  The use of quantitative ABI with incoherent X-ray sources is not widespread and the first set of results pertains to the feasibility of quantitative ABI imaging and phase retrieval using a rotating anode X-ray source. The necessary conditions for observation of ABI phase contrast are deduced from elementary coherence considerations and numerical simulations. We then focus on the problem of extracting quantitative information from ABI images recorded using an extended incoherent X-ray source. The results of an experiment performed at Friedrich-Schiller University, Germany using a rotating anode X-ray source demonstrate the validity of our approach. It is shown that quantitative information may be extracted from such images under quite general and practicable conditions.  We then develop a new use for phase contrast imaging systems that allows the Green&#8217;s function associated with a linear shift-invariant imaging system to be deduced from two phase contrast images of a known weak object. This new approach is applied to X-ray crystallography where the development of efficient methods of inferring the phase of rocking curves is an important open problem. We show how the complex Green&#8217;s function describing Bragg reflection of a coherent scalar X-ray wavefield from a crystal may be recovered from a single image over a wide range of reciprocal space simultaneously. The solution we derive is fast, non-iterative and deterministic. When applied to crystalline structures for which the kinematic scattering approximation is valid, such as thin crystalline films, our technique is shown to solve the famous one-dimensional phase retrieval problem which allows us to directly invert the Green&#8217;s function to retrieve the depth-dependent interplanar spacing.  Finally we implement our Green&#8217;s function retrieval method on experimental data collected at the SPring-8 synchrotron in Hyogo, Japan. In the experiment we recorded analyser-based phase contrast images of a known weak object using a thick perfect silicon analyser crystal. It is then demonstrated that these measurements can be inverted to recover the complex Green&#8217;s function associated with the analyser crystal Bragg peak. The reconstructed Green&#8217;s function is found to be in good agreement with the prediction of dynamical diffraction theory.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coherent</field><field name="subject">X-ray</field><field name="subject">Imaging</field><field name="subject">Crystal analyser</field><field name="subject">Phase retrieval</field><field name="subject">Phase problem</field><field name="subject">Green function</field><field name="subject">Optics</field><field name="subject">Diffraction</field><field name="subject">Scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/57830</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of uniform particles via single stream drying and new applications of the reaction engineering approach</field><field name="creator">Patel, Kamleshkumar Chhanabhai</field><field name="description">In this thesis investigations are carried out on two research topics in context to spray drying. The first research topic is the production of dried particles having uniform characteristics. The second research topic is the development of new applications of the reaction engineering approach which, in recent times, has emerged as an effective tool to formulate drying kinetics models. The reaction engineering approach is also implemented to simulate the drying of monodisperse droplets corresponding to the experimental work in the first research topic.  Manufacturing micron- and nano-sized particles having uniform characteristics has recently become a popular research area due to the unique functionalities of these kinds of particles in biomedical, drug delivery, functional foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics and other valuable applications. Spray drying has been a common and economical route to produce dried particles. A typical characteristic of spray dried products is the existence of a significant variation in particle properties such as size and morphology. One possible idea to restrict this product non-uniformity is to achieve a good control over the droplet&#8217;s behaviour and characteristics inside the drying chamber. The current thesis has investigated an innovative spray drying technique, i.e. a single stream drying approach in order to restrict product non-uniformity. In this drying approach, identical sized droplets having vertical trajectories are dried under controlled gas flow conditions. The piezoelectricity-driven monodisperse droplet generator is used as the atomizer to disperse liquid droplets. A prototype single stream dryer was assembled based on the single stream drying approach using various components designed in the laboratory and several parts purchased from the market. Experiments were carried out using aqueous lactose solutions as a model system in order to check the practicability of manufacturing uniform-sized spherical particles. Preliminary results were found to be positive and reported in this thesis. Mathematical models on the drying of monodisperse droplets were developed in order to predict important droplet and gas parameter profiles during single stream drying. These models serve as a platform for design, optimization and scale-up purposes. Several important advantages and drawbacks of single stream drying are also reported. Problems encountered during the experimental work and future recommendations are presented in detail so that a more robust and effective drying research tool can be developed in future. Recently the reaction engineering approach (REA) has emerged as a simple and reliable technique to characterize the drying of various food and dairy materials. In this thesis two new applications of the REA are described for the first time in context to convective drying of aqueous droplets. The REA is used in this study to formulate the drying kinetics model for the drying of aqueous sucrose and maltodextrin (DE6) droplets. The effect of initial moisture content was explicitly demonstrated. The development of a new &#8216;composite&#8217; REA which aimed to model the drying of aqueous droplets containing multiple solutes has been described. The composite REA was found to be suitable to characterize the drying behaviour of aqueous sucrose-maltodextrin mixtures of different proportions.  The second new application of the REA is the development of a procedure to estimate surface properties of aqueous droplets during drying. In literature various droplet characteristics such as surface moisture contents were normally estimated using the diffusion-based drying kinetics model or the receding interface model. Surface moisture content and surface glass transition temperature profiles were evaluated here using a lumped-parameter model (REA) during the drying of aqueous sucrose, maltodextrin (DE6) and their mixtures. The same experimental data used for the development of the composite REA were used to yield predictions. The procedure was found to be useful in estimating surface moisture contents and understanding the stickiness behaviour of sugar droplets during drying. During the formulation of the REA-based drying kinetics model in this thesis, the assumption of uniform temperature within droplets was used. In most studies published in literature the uniform temperature assumption was justified by calculating the heat-transfer Biot numbers at the beginning and end of drying. However, the conventional Biot number concept does not take into account the evaporation effect and therefore would not be suitable to drying scenarios. In this thesis, a new approximation procedure is developed to estimate surface-centre temperature differences within materials following the entire drying process. This new procedure was helpful to check the extent of temperature non-uniformity within skim milk droplets under isothermal laboratory conditions as well as industrial spray drying conditions. Both conventional and drying-based Biot numbers are calculated and compared. Predictions showed that temperature gradients within the droplets were negligible during the drying of suspended droplets under laboratory drying conditions (slow drying), whilst the gradients were small and existed only for a short drying period for small droplets under industrial spray drying conditions (fast drying). Furthermore, it was observed that the maximum temperature gradient within the droplets did not exist at the starting or end points of the drying process, and therefore the estimation of Biot numbers at the starting and end point does not reflect temperature non-uniformity under drying conditions. This is a significant theoretical development in the area.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spray drying</field><field name="subject">Drying kinetics</field><field name="subject">Reaction engineering approach</field><field name="subject">Sugar droplet drying</field><field name="subject">Uniform particles</field><field name="subject">Inkjet nozzle</field><field name="subject">Monodisperse droplets</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/59514</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation behaviour and twinning mechanisms of commercially pure titanium alloys</field><field name="creator">Battaini, Michael</field><field name="description">The deformation behaviour and twinning mechanisms of commercially pure titanium alloys were investigated using complementary diffraction techniques and crystal plasticity modelling. The main motivation for conducting this investigation was to improve understanding of the deformation of titanium to help achieve the long term aim of reducing manufacturing and design costs. The deformation behaviour was characterised with tension, compression and channel die compression tests for three important variables: orientation; temperature from 25 C to 600 C; and composition for two contrasting alloys, CP-G1 and CP-G4. The experimental data used to characterise the behaviour and determine the mechanisms causing it were: textures determined by X-ray diffraction; twin area fractions for individual modes determined using electron back-scatter diffraction; and lattice strains measured by neutron diffraction.  A strong effect of the orientation&#8211;stress state conditions on the flow curves (flow stress anisotropy) was found. The propensity for prism hai slip was the dominant cause of the behaviour &#8211; samples that were more favourably oriented for prism hai slip had lower flow stresses. Twinning was the most significant secondary deformation mode in the CP-G1 alloy but only had a minor effect on flow stress anisotropy in most cases. In the CP-G4 alloy twinning generally did not play a significant role indicating that hc + ai slip modes were significant in this alloy. Differences in the flow stress anisotropy between the two alloys were found to occur largely in the elasto-plastic transition and initial period of hardening. Modelling results indicated that larger relative resolved shear stress values for secondary deformation modes in the higher purity alloy increased the initial anisotropy.  Decreasing flow stresses with increasing temperature were largely caused by a decrease in the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) values for slip, but also by a decrease in the Hall-Petch parameter for slip.  The propagation of twinning was found to be orientation dependent through a Schmid law in a similar way to slip &#8211; it was activated at a CRSS and hardened so that an increasing resolved shear stress was required for it to continue operating. The CRSS values determined for the individual twin modes were &#8211; 65MPa, 180MPa, 83MPa for {1012}, {1122} and {1011} twinning, respectively. Further, twinning was found to be temperature insensitive except when the ability to nucleate twins posed a significant barrier (for {1011} twinning). Also, the CRSS for {1012} twinning was clearly shown to increase with decreasing alloy purity.  A thorough method for determining crystal plasticity modelling parameters based on experimental data was formulated. Additionally, twinning was modelled in a physically realistic manner influenced by the present findings using the visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) model. In particular: the activity of twinning decreased in a natural way due to greater difficulty in its operation rather than through an enforced saturation; and hardening or softening due to changes in orientation and dynamic Hall-Petch hardening were important. The rigorous modelling procedure gave great confidence in the key experimental findings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deformation</field><field name="subject">Titanium</field><field name="subject">Visco-plastic self-consistent</field><field name="subject">Elasto-plastic self-consistent</field><field name="subject">Twinning</field><field name="subject">Crystallography</field><field name="subject">Anisotropy</field><field name="subject">Orientation</field><field name="subject">Temperature</field><field name="subject">Critical resolved shear stress</field><field name="subject">Hexagonal close-packed</field><field name="subject">Electron back-scatter diffraction</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/61321</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy</field><field name="creator">Crosbie, Jeffrey</field><field name="description">This thesis presents interdisciplinary, collaborative research in the field of synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy (MRT).  Synchrotron MRT is an experimental radiotherapy technique under consideration for clinical use, following demonstration of efficacy in tumour-bearing rodent models with remarkable sparing of normal tissue.  A high flux, X-ray beam from a synchrotron is segmented into micro-planar arrays of narrow beams, typically 25 &#956;m wide and with peak-to-peak separations of 200 &#956;m.  The radiobiological effect of MRT and the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood.  The ratio between dose in the &#8216;peaks&#8217;of the microbeams to the dose in the &#8216;valleys&#8217;, between the microbeams, has strong biological significance.  However, there are difficulties in accurately measuring the dose distribution for MRT.  The aim of this thesis is to address elements of both the dosimetric and radiobiological gaps that exist in the field of synchrotron MRT.  A method of film dosimetry and microdensitometry was adapted in order to measure the peak-to-valley dose ratios for synchrotron MRT.  Two types of radiochromic film were irradiated in a phantom and also flush against a microbeam collimator on beamline BL28B2 at the SPring-8 synchrotron.  The HD-810 and EBT varieties of radiochromic film were used to record peak dose and valley dose respectively.  In other experiments, a dose build-up effect was investigated and the half value layer of the beam with and without the microbeam collimator was measured to investigate the effect of the collimator on the beam quality.  The valley dose obtained for films placed flush against the collimator was approximately 0.25% of the peak dose.  Within the water phantom, the valley dose had increased to between 0.7&#8211;1.8% of the peak dose, depending on the depth in the phantom.  We also demonstrated, experimentally and by Monte Carlo simulation, that the dose is not maximal on the surface and that there is a dose build-up effect.  The microbeam collimator did not make an appreciable difference to the beam quality.  The measured values of peak-to-valley dose ratio were higher than those predicted by previously published Monte Carlo simulation papers.  For the radiobiological studies, planar (560 Gy) or cross-planar (2 x 280 Gy or 2 x 560 Gy) irradiations were delivered to mice inoculated with mammary tumours in their leg, on beamline BL28B2 at the SPring-8 synchrotron.  Immunohistochemical staining for DNA double strand breaks, proliferation and apoptosis was performed on irradiated tissue sections. The MRT response was compared to conventional radiotherapy at 11, 22 or 44 Gy.  The results of the study provides the first evidence for a differential tissue response at a cellular level between normal and tumour tissues following synchrotron MRT.  Within 24 hours of MRT to tumour, obvious cell migration had occurred into and out of irradiated zones. MRT-irradiated tumours showed significantly less proliferative capacity by 24 hours post-irradiation (P = 0.002).  Median survival times for EMT-6.5 and 67NR tumour-bearing mice following MRT (2 x 560 Gy) and conventional radiotherapy (22 Gy) increased significantly compared to unirradiated controls (P &lt; 0.0005).  However, there was markedly less normal tissue damage from MRT than from conventional radiotherapy.  MRT-treated normal skin mounts a more coordinated repair response than tumours.  Cell-cell communication of death signals from directly irradiated, migrating cells, may explain why tumours are less resistant to high dose MRT than normal tissue.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbeam radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Dosimetry</field><field name="subject">Synchrotron</field><field name="subject">Radiobiology</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/64948</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Waiting for mum: the impact of maternal incarceration on adolescent children</field><field name="creator">Flynn, Catherine Anne</field><field name="description">In western countries such as Australia, the U.S. and the U.K., the women&#8217;s prison population has increased exponentially over the past decade, far outstripping the rate of growth in male imprisonment. The majority of women in prison are the mothers of dependent children. Subsequently, increasing numbers of children are being separated from their mothers; many displaced from home and effectively left parentless. Despite a growing body of knowledge since the 1960s, and growing numbers of children affected, little is known about these children, particularly older children and adolescents. This study examines the impact of maternal imprisonment on 20 young people, aged between 10 and 18 years, whose mothers were incarcerated in the two women&#8217;s prisons in Victoria (Australia). Data was gathered directly from young people themselves, as well as from their mothers and a small cohort of professionals, after the mother&#8217;s release from prison. To answer the research question, the study sought retrospective and predominantly qualitative data on children&#8217;s lives before, during and after their mother&#8217;s imprisonment. The data was analysed in a variety of ways, initially through the development of case studies and then across cases using thematic content analysis, drawing on themes emerging from the data and a priori categories gleaned from earlier research. The study shows that maternal incarceration has a significant impact on the lives of adolescents, and that it is uncommon for children to have secure care arrangements in place at the time of their mother&#8217;s imprisonment. For children to be displaced from home is also common, although most maintain some contact with their mother over the course of her imprisonment. While the majority of children return home to live with their mother, this is largely influenced by the child&#8217;s pre-prison placement and their visiting patterns during the imprisonment. Interestingly, although many young people are not satisfied with their care arrangements, particularly those who are cared for by their fathers, and cope with difficulties by internalising them, most do not report persistent adverse effects.  The study provides new and challenging ideas. It describes the important role played by care planning in children&#8217;s reaction to maternal incarceration; this has not previously been examined. The findings also illustrate the poor coping mechanisms employed by children and discuss the range of social factors which affect this coping. Finally, factors influential in actual family reunifications are described and examined; very few studies, and none in Australia, have previously sought this data. The study provides a description of family reunification pathways, and highlights the importance of pre-prison placement and children&#8217;s visiting. The study findings stress that the impact of a mother&#8217;s imprisonment begins before sentencing and continues beyond her release. Yet research to date has focused predominantly on the period of a mother&#8217;s imprisonment. Overall, the study finds that limited formal or informal attention is given by adults involved to children&#8217;s needs. They are little seen or acknowledged at any point during their mother&#8217;s contact with the adult criminal justice process. From her arrest, through sentencing, imprisonment and planning for release, they are not considered to be participants in the proceedings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maternal imprisonment</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68388</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of institutions, organisational governance and managerial intentionality on the internationalisation of smaller Indian firms</field><field name="creator">Bangara, Athena</field><field name="description">Emerging economies and the behaviour of firms domiciled in these markets is beginning to develop as a research area; yet little empirical work exists (Bruton, Ahlstrom, &amp; Obloj, 2008; Hoskisson, Eden, Lau, &amp; Wright, 2000; Meyer &amp; Peng, 2005; Peng, Wang, &amp; Jiang, 2008; Wright, Filatotchev, Hoskisson, &amp; Peng, 2005). An extensive and critical review of the literature revealed that there was limited research that focused on the internationalisation of emerging economy firms to other emerging and developed economies. In order to address this clear gap in our understanding, the broad research problem that this thesis sets out to investigate is &#8216;how do institutions, organisational governance and managerial intentionality effect the internationalisation of smaller Indian firms&#8217;? It is argued that in order for research in strategy to make a lasting contribution, there is a need to contemplate whether the theories and methodologies developed in primarily mature and developed economies are applicable to the emerging economy context (Wright et al., 2005). In addressing this concern, this study draws on institutional theory, transaction cost theory, the resource-based view and aspects of the organisational capabilities perspective in order to understand the internationalisation of smaller Indian firms. In particular, the aim of this research was to understand the effect of institutions (Research Question One), organisational governance (Research Question Two) and the moderating effect of managerial intentionality (Research Question Three) on the internationalisation of smaller Indian firms. India was chosen as the context for the study due to its rapid growth in recent years which places it among the four big emerging economies of the world (Wilson &amp; Purushothaman, 2003). The relatively recent liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1991 provides an interesting context within which to study the internationalisation behaviour of firms. Prior to its liberalisation India adopted what was known as an inward-focused, socialist-style, economic framework (Wilson &amp; Keim, 2006). The liberalisation of the Indian economy has increased the country&#8217;s trade linkages with other emerging and developed countries, yet little research has been conducted on the internationalisation of Indian firms (Peng et al., 2008; Wright et al., 2005). Further, India&#8217;s linguistic distance but geographic closeness to emerging markets, yet western Commonwealth past and geographic distance to developed markets makes it a unique context. The research methodology adopted in this study entailed a qualitative design conducted through multiple case studies. The case study firms comprised four smaller manufacturing and four smaller service firms. Cases for the study were selected theoretically (Eisenhardt, 1989) using intensity sampling, snowball sampling, criterion sampling and opportunistic sampling techniques (Patton, 1990). To determine the size of the firms, the definition proposed by the Government of India was used. One key growth region in India was chosen due to the institutional diversity in India. Bangalore was chosen as it is considered a high growth region of the country that is well reputed for its service sector, as well as a competitive manufacturing sector (Ahya, Xie, Roach, Sheth, &amp; Yam, 2006). The adoption of a multiple case study design facilitated an aggregated cross-case analysis. The data was collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with senior management in the selected case study firms. In addition, documentary evidence was collected through newspaper articles, information from trade journals and information from the company websites. The interviews were guided by an interview protocol and a case study database was created for each firm in order to increase the reliability and validity of the data. The data was coded using NVivo (version 7) and analysed using the &#8216;template approach&#8217; (Crabtree &amp; Miller, 1999).  To date, literature originating out of mature markets has regarded institutions as background information due to the stability and maturity of institutions in these markets (Ingram &amp; Silverman, 2002). However, when studied in an emerging market context, the role of institutions is argued to be pushed to the forefront of strategy research due to its relative underdevelopment (Meyer &amp; Peng, 2005). This study used Scott&#8217;s (1995) three institutional pillars (regulative, normative and cognitive) to gain an institution-based view of the business strategies pursued by the smaller Indian firms (Peng et al., 2008). The findings highlighted regulatory institutional influences at the home country, host country and trade policy levels. The findings from this study shed light on the notion of institutional entrepreneurship, thereby extending institutional theory to take into account the strategic behaviour of firms. The findings further emphasised the need to gain legitimacy in international markets as a means to gain access to resources and overcome the liabilities of foreignness and newness. In doing so, the findings from this study extended Mathews&#8217; (2006) &#8216;linkage, leverage and learning&#8217; strategy to a &#8216;linkage, leverage, learning and legitimising&#8217; strategy. Next, the findings from Research Question One extended the U-Model of internationalisation to highlight the importance of domestic market experience when gained in an institutionally complex market such as India. Finally, the findings highlighted the interaction between the path-dependent experience of the founders and the various dimensions of their managerial intentionality in managing the institutional influences on the firm.  In studying organisational governance decisions (Research Question Two), transaction cost theory was used as the key conceptual perspective. This study used Williamson&#8217;s (1975) governance continuum to understand the organisational governance decisions of smaller Indian firms. Interestingly, the findings emphasised a move away from the narrow comparative-efficiency framework developed by Williamson (1975), towards a more eclectic understanding of the effect of transaction costs. The findings highlighted the choice of governance modes not as discrete designs, but as those that overlap as a result of being influenced by institutions, the experience of the firm with a particular mode, the propensity to trust, the constraints on firm behaviour, the managerial intentionality of the founders and the need to gain local knowledge from network partners. In adopting this broader perspective, the findings addressed the call by Madhok (1997) to understand the choice of governance modes from more than a cost minimisation perspective. Hutzschenreuter, Pedersen and Volberda (2007) suggested that the role of managerial discretion to date is downplayed in existing IB literature and hence called for research to focus on the role of managerial intent in the strategies of established multinationals rather than on the process of &#8216;becoming a multinational&#8217;. Research Question Three highlighted the moderating effect of managerial intentionality in managing the institutional influences and governance decisions of the firm. This study extended Hutzschenreuter et al.&#8217;s (2007) conceptualisation of managerial intentionality by emphasising the resilience as well as the reluctance of the founders (due to past experiences) as important in the emerging economy context. This study has practical implications for the case study firms as well as for potential entrants into India. Firstly, for the case study firms it is important to develop clear internationalisation strategies (as opposed to a reactive approach) due to the increasing competition both locally and internationally. Second, for the manufacturing firms, it is important to move beyond their pure low cost advantage. Partnering with other companies to leverage their resources and capabilities in international markets is one possibility. Third, for these firms to remain globally competitive, the sourcing of international talent is likely to increase their legitimacy and reduce their liability of foreignness. Finally, the continued liberalisation of the Indian economy has made it an attractive destination for foreign firms. While the case study companies have recognised the opportunities overseas, they should not ignore their domestic market where they enjoy a &#8216;home court advantage&#8217;. For potential entrants into India, it is important to recognise the potential competitive advantage that local incumbents have with regard to the environment. Second, foreign firms entering India and competing with smaller players need to understand the subtleties of the market and tailor their strategies to meet local needs.  Finally, while this study has made contributions to the field, the findings must be interpreted in light of the limitations of the study. First, this study focused on one key big emerging market; India.  Further, within India only one key region was examined. The findings reflect the business strategies by firms domiciled in Bangalore. Hence future studies could extend this research to other emerging markets and other regions of India to gain a more detailed perspective. Second, given the qualitative nature of the study, only analytical generalisations can be made. However, these insights can provide a basis for future researchers to develop quantitative measures to test the inferences drawn. Finally, this study was cross sectional in nature. In order to gain a more detailed analysis on the effect of institutions, future researchers may consider a longitudinal design to capture the institutional transitions over time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internationalisation of Indian firms</field><field name="subject">Domestic experience</field><field name="subject">Corruption</field><field name="subject">Resilience of founders</field><field name="subject">Networks and contacts</field><field name="subject">Legitimacy</field><field name="subject">Qualitative case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68403</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation, international education and the marketing of TESOL: student identity as a site of conflicting forces</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Md Raqibuddin</field><field name="description">This study provides a critique of institutional discourses that are informed by race, culture and identity, learning constraints and particular constructions of English and offers ways of thinking that encourage multiplicity and complexity. Its principal aim is to probe issues relating to the identity formation of international TESOL students in the context of the globalisation of international education. To achieve this aim, the study poses questions about the commodification of the TESOL machinery through marketing programmes and its impact on international TESOL students. In addressing these questions the study considers Australian universities&#8217; marketing practices, the discursive representation of international students by these universities and the government, as well as wider matters of educational policy. The research draws on poststructuralist and postcolonial theories, particularly on selected aspects of the works of Foucault and Said and in so doing demonstrates the usefulness of such theories for exploring issues associated with international TESOL students. Taking from these theorists the concepts of power/knowledge, subjectivity, identity and agency, it also incorporates the work of cultural theorists such as Althusser and Hall.  The participants were drawn from a wide range of cultural, linguistic and professional backgrounds, enrolled in Masters of TESOL at Australian universities. Through dialogic sessions with them and documentary analysis the discursive practices of the university sites were examined. So too were the subjectivities of students, as they became involved in the various activities of the institution in which they were enrolled, before, during and after their studies.  Overall, the analysis reveals how the subjectivities of international TESOL students are constructed both by the university and the students themselves. The students&#8217; accounts of their experiences broadly conflicted with the sweeping claims made by certain institutes, as well as by the dominant knowledges of marketing, international education and globalisation. The analysis shows how the subjectivities of international TESOL students are constructed by both the university and by the students themselves. It also shows how economics has become firmly entrenched in a market discourse and overall how international students are inscribed within policy shifts. The academic welfare, teaching and learning processes of the university indicated little awareness of the fluidity of culture and language or hybridity of its international students. A consequence of this myopic vision of the university is that students are subjected to constricting, divisive and exclusionary discursive practices that fail to properly acknowledge their complex histories, subjectivities and professional aspirations. An identity has been created for them that is not only superficial but also inaccurate.  The findings point to the benefits of examining through a Foucauldian analytic such discursive practices of the institution alongside the subjectivities of students. The approach adopted in the research points to the possibility of moving beyond the current reductionist dualisms and binaries to the adoption of educational and institutional practices that recognise students&#8217; hybridity and syncretic subjectivity. In such a space, the meaning of &#8216;international students&#8217; and the institutional and educational policies and practices designed for them might be renegotiated. The study concludes that if the goal of genuine internationalisation is to be achieved, there is a need for significant institutional change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TESOL</field><field name="subject">International education</field><field name="subject">Globalisation</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">International education in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68680</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The knowledge commons in Victoria and Singapore: an exploration of community roles in the shaping of cultural institutions</field><field name="creator">Pang, Natalie</field><field name="description">&#8216;The commons&#8217; is a concept originating from the traditional shared use of land, but which now often refers to any social asset, physical or abstract, that is shared. This research concerns one aspect of the commons, namely the knowledge commons.  The thesis explores community roles in developing and sustaining cultural institutions as key components of the knowledge commons. It focuses particularly on processes of participatory design, and on the capacity of digital technologies to support community engagement. The study takes place across the cultural contexts of the State of Victoria (Australia) and Singapore. The three key aims of the thesis are to explore in what ways and to what extent:  I. The emerging concept of the knowledge commons relates to the role of cultural institutions as systems for the creation and sharing of sustainable knowledge resources by their communities. II. The notion of participative design may be applicable to the ongoing development of such systems as multi-stakeholder partnerships to meet community needs. III. Differences in national culture may affect the generality of such an analysis.  The research design employs literature analysis and multiple case studies as a basis for proposing new theorisations and an analytical tool to assist future action by cultural institutions and relevant communities. The main perspective used in framing the literature analysis and case studies is Giddens&#8217; structuration theory. Structuration sees the continuing interplay between social action and social structure as the means by which the cultural patternings known as institutions are recursively produced. A complementary perspective used is Hofstede&#8217;s model of cultural dimensions. Other theorists from a range of disciplines provide perspectives on particular concepts or aspects, such as the commons and participatory design.  Five chapters are headed &#8216;Foundations&#8217;. These seek to explicate key dimensions of the research, namely the knowledge commons, community knowledge, cultural institutions, participatory design, and the cultural contexts of Victoria and Singapore.  Four chapters are headed &#8216;Case Study&#8217; and deal with individual cultural institutions, or clusters of institutions, which were the sites of exploratory enquiry (generally consisting of interviews and observation, but in the case of Museum Victoria also elements of action research). The cultural institutions covered by these chapters are Museum Victoria/Women on Farms Gathering, the Asian Civilisations Museum, Public Libraries in Victoria and Public Libraries in Singapore.  These insights are analysed to propose a series of related typologies. The coverage of these typologies includes resource characteristics, collective processes, and cultural dimensions. The typologies come together as components of an integrated, explanatory conceptual model concerning the relationships between the commons, cultural institutions, communities, collective processes (including the role of information and communication technologies) and participatory design within cultural institutions.  In the final chapter answers are formulated for the initiating research questions. Also the integrated model developed by the thesis is used as the basis for a proposed analytical tool to assist action towards enhanced community engagement in the development of cultural institutions. Use of the tool is illustrated by application to several examples of collective action encountered during the research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge commons</field><field name="subject">Structuration</field><field name="subject">Cultural institutions</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural</field><field name="subject">Collective processes</field><field name="subject">Communities</field><field name="subject">Participatory design</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68708</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc and copper behaviour during stormwater aquifer storage and recovery in sandy aquifers</field><field name="creator">Wendelborn, Anke</field><field name="description">In the light of increasing demand and diminishing supplies a sustainable urban water management for Melbourne and other cities will need to include water recycling and reuse of reclaimed water and stormwater. One key issue in stormwater reuse is the need for storage between times of collection until times of demand. Aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) would be a valuable option as it has limited space requirements and restricts loss from evaporation. However, stormwater commonly contains elevated levels of heavy metals, of which Zn and Cu are the most mobile. Stormwater also contains suspended solids, organic carbon, oxygen and nutrients, which influence the behaviour of injected metals and induce geochemical changes in the aquifer. While stormwater ASR has been practiced in limestone aquifers in South Australia, field data for sandy aquifers, which are more prevalent around Melbourne, are very limited. Risk assessment regarding the potential impact of stormwater ASR on the quality of the aquifer and groundwater resources in sandy aquifer is therefore necessary.  After a characterisation of stormwater from different Melbourne catchments confirmed comparatively high concentrations of Zn and Cu in stormwater, three siliceous aquifer sediments were used in a series of batch sorption experiments as well as column experiments imitating one ASR cycle to assess the impact of different parameters on Zn and Cu behaviour. The reactive geochemical transport model PHT3D was then modified to simulate experimental results with the outlook that it could be used as a predictive tool for long term evaluation.  The study showed that Zn adsorption was limited and desorption of large fractions occurred, indicating that injected amounts of Zn are mobile and would mainly be recovered. In contrast, Cu adsorption was higher and desorption was limited, indicating that injected amounts of Cu would mainly accumulate in the aquifer. The release of metals was triggered by reduction in pH, increase in ionic strength and particle mobilisation. Metal concentrations were also increased after storage phases, while minor sediment constituents, especially organic matter, significantly reduce metal mobility. The different role of dissolved and solid organic carbon is critical in understanding Cu behaviour during stormwater ASR.  Pretreatment of stormwater to reduce the injection of colloids, organic carbon and metals are recommended to limit metal accumulation in the subsurface. Monitoring of water quality throughout the ASR cycle would be encouraged to validate the current findings with field data. Special attention should be paid to backflushed water quality to ensure correct disposal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stormwater</field><field name="subject">Aquifer storage and recovery</field><field name="subject">Heavy metals</field><field name="subject">Column experiments</field><field name="subject">Batch experiments</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68715</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At home in Australia: identity, nation and the teaching of English as a second language to adult immigrants in Australia</field><field name="creator">Faine, Miriam</field><field name="description">This is an autoethnographic study (e.g. Brodkey, 1994) based on &#8216;stories&#8217; from my own personal and professional journey as an adult ESL teacher which I use to narrate some aspects of adult ESL teaching.  With migration one of the most dramatically contested spheres of modern political life world wide (Hall, 1998), adult English as a Second Language (ESL) teaching is increasingly a matter of social concern and political policy, as we see in the current political debates in Australia concerning immigration, citizenship and language. In Australia as an imagined community (Anderson, 1991), the song goes &#8216;we are, you are Australian and in one voice we sing&#8217;. In this study I argue that this voice of normative &#8216;Australianess&#8217; is discursively aligned with White Australians as native speakers (an essential, biological formulation). Stretching Pennycook&#8217;s (1994a) argument that ELT (English Language Teaching) as a discourse aligns with colonialism, I suggest that the field of adult ESL produces, classifies and measures the conditions of sameness and difference to this normative &#8216;Australian&#8217;. The second language speaker is discursively constructed as always a deficient communicator compared with the native speaker. The binary between an imagined homogeneous Australia and the &#8216;migrant&#8217; as essentially other, works against the inclusion of the learner into the dominant groups represented by their teachers, so that the intentions of adult ESL pedagogy and provision are mitigated by this imagining, problematizing and containing of the learners as other. The role of ESL teachers is to supervise (Hage, 1998) the incorporation of this other.  Important policy interventions (e.g. Department of Immigration and Citizenship, 2006; ALLP, 1991a) are based on understanding the English language as a universalist framework of language competences inherent in the native speaker; on understanding language as consisting of fixed structures which are external to the learner and their social contexts; and on a perception that language as generic, transferable cognitive skills can be taught universally with suitable curricula and sufficient funding. Conversely in this study I recognise language as linguistic systems that define groups and regulate social relations, forming &#8216;a will to community&#8217; (Pennycook, op. cit.) or &#8216;communities of practice&#8217; (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). Language as complex local and communal practices emerges from specific contexts. Language is embedded in acts of identity (e.g. Bakhtin, 1981) developing through dialogue, involving the emotions as well as the intellect, so that &#8216;voice&#8217; is internal to desires and thoughts and hence part of identity.  Following Norton (2000) who links the practices of adult ESL learners as users of English within the social relations of their every day lives, with their identities as &#8220;migrants&#8221;, I suggest that the stabilisation of language by language learners known as interlanguage reflects diaspora as a hybrid life world. More effective ESL policies, programs and pedagogies that assist immigrant learners feel &#8216;at home&#8217; within Australia as a community of practice (Wenger, 1998) rest on understanding immigrant life worlds as diasporic (Gilroy, 1997).  The research recommends an adult ESL pedagogy that responds to the understanding of language as socially constituted practices that are situated in social, local, everyday workplace and community events and spaces. Practices of identity and their representation through language can be re-negotiated through engagement in collective activities in ESL classes that form third spaces (Soja, 1999). The possibilities for language development that emerge are in accord with the learners&#8217; affective investment in the new language community, but occur as improvements in making effective meanings, rather than conformity to the formal linguistic system (Pavlenko &amp; Lantolf, 2000).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult English as a second language teaching</field><field name="subject">Identity and ESL</field><field name="subject">Second language acquisition and identity</field><field name="subject">Diaspora and language learning</field><field name="subject">Immigration and language policy in Australia</field><field name="subject">Immigrant language learning</field><field name="subject">Adult ESL teachers</field><field name="subject">Language policy in Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/68741</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Connection</field><field name="creator">Van Polanen Petel, Humphrey P.</field><field name="description">De Saussure (1916:35) held that the nature of language-systems consists in what they have in common with all other semiotic systems. This thesis aims to provide an answer. It starts with the &#8216;parts of speech&#8217; and uses the verb-noun distinction to separate language into a calculus and a protocol. The Principle of Connection is proposed as a structure-forming capacity and defined as a fixed hierarchical mental structure. Language is defined as a &#8216;way of normalising meaning through signalling&#8217;. The linearity of language enforces three types of notational elements: those having no relation, one relation (either direction) and two relations (both directions). Quine&#8217;s (1960:83f) &#8216;quality space&#8217; is combined with the Gestalt notion of figure-ground into a schematic semantics of perception based on the necessarycontingent and the intrinsic-extrinsic distinctions. The Principle of Connection is shown to be the logical operation AND with its operands evaluated as identical, similar, different or contrary. The schema translates into the ontological categories of Universal Grammar (UG) giving as possible types of lexeme: Identifier, Qualifier, Quantifier and Connective. The validity of the schema is verified successfully against the language of the Predicate Calculus (PC). The schema further expresses both the whole-of-parts and the part-of-a-whole perspective as well as the analytic and synthetic method. &#8216;Grammar&#8217; is analysed through a discussion of the possible errors of protocol and grammar proper is shown to consist in the cultural variations of UG. The basic structure of English is found to be (Quantity) (Quality) Essence (Relation). An analysis of verbs is presented on the basis of the schema. Lastly, the prototypical connectives are given as IS, AND, BUT and OR and it is shown how all others are troponymic extensions in a radial network centred on these four.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/7505</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and structural survey of novel rare earth aryloxide and pyrazolate complexes</field><field name="creator">Gitlits, Alexander, 1975-</field><field name="description">Abstract not available</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereochemistry</field><field name="subject">Rare earth metal compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Organometallic compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Complex compounds -- Synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/8996</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The furniture tourist : escaping the habitue : an exegesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a degree of Masters of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Apthorp, Jane Frances</field><field name="description">Kenneth Bayes describes two ways in which we move through space.

The tourist is an &#8220;exploratory through an unknown environment&#8221; (Porter, 1997, p. 44) - which is juxtaposed against the habitu&#233;, who is &#8220;the habitual through a known environment&#8221; (Porter, 1997, p. 44). Each concept is the other&#8217;s polar opposite. The habitu&#233; is bound by routine, while the tourist is active and engaging in their environment, discovering new possibilities and exciting alternatives. The tourist looks upon their environments with fresh eyes. They are open, receptive and able to imagine possibilities where forms in rooms bend, waver and swell. Imagining tells stories which provoke and expand our thoughts. It allows one to escape preconceptions about the nominal nature of objects and our relationship with them. This research explores these characters, the habitu&#233; and the tourist, in relation to furniture and its arrangement within the interior. It investigates how the habitu&#233; may over time become the tourist in their own familiar environment. I am the tourist within this research who activates drawing, making, writing and photography as productive processes of imagining exciting alternatives for furniture.

This prompts the hypothesis of this design thesis, which suggests that statistical data when visually mapped and in the context of its physical environment can provide significant cognitive and ecological awareness for the viewer to understand the economic and environmental implications of the proposed irrigation scheme. Both the areas of cartographic mapping and the dairy industry contain controlled vocabularies, which present opportunity for graphic modeling and explanation through visible phenomena. The Canterbury Plains has a well-established historical and agricultural narrative. However, due to the recent dramatic and substantial transition of the region&#8217;s dairy industry between the periods 1995 &#8211; 2008, subsequent demand for freshwater now represents the real prospect of uncharted future environmental instability. The development of a visual language system capable of the interpretation and construction of the irrigation scheme&#8217;s benefits and potential negative implications, provide this thesis through graphic modeling the possibility to compare the proposed CPW scheme&#8217;s issues. While some industry groups consider public participation as arbitrary and unnecessary, recent surveys indicate water quality and fertiliser management as the most significant areas for environmental concern.

One way of controlling postoperative pain is administration of a single analgesic or a combination of different classes of analgesics prior to the onset of noxious stimuli. A constraint to the perioperative use of traditional opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is their undesirable side effects. In this series of experiments, the preventive (pre-emptive) analgesic efficacy of two popular human analgesics, tramadol (an ?atypical? opioid) and parecoxib (a NSAID with selective COX-2 inhibition) was evaluated in dogs. Initially, the efficacy and renal safety of parecoxib, tramadol and a combination of parecoxib, tramadol and pindolol (a -adrenoceptor blocker and 5-HT1A/1B antagonist) were screened in anaesthetised healthy dogs. These analgesics increased the dogs? nociceptive threshold to mechanical stimuli, without causing significant alterations in the dogs? glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by plasma iohexol clearance. Subsequently, the efficacy of tramadol was compared with morphine, in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy or castration. The Glasgow composite measure pain scale-short form score (CMPS-SF) and changes in intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) responses were used to assess the efficacy of analgesics. Of the three treatment groups (preoperative morphine, 0.5 mg kg-1; preoperative tramadol, 3 mg kg-1; a ?combination? of preoperative low-dose morphine, 0.1 mg kg-1, and postoperative tramadol 3 mg kg-1), dogs given the ?combination? had significantly lower pain scores after ovariohysterectomy. In castrated dogs, preoperative tramadol (3 mg kg-1) and morphine (0.5 mg kg-1) were tested and no significant difference in the CMPS-SF score were observed between them. Changes in EEG variables were not specific between the treatment groups in ovariohysterectomised dogs. Finally, the efficacy of test drugs was evaluated against acute noxious electrical stimulation in anaesthetised dogs, using EEG. Median frequency of the EEG, a reliable indicator of nociception, increased significantly in tramadol and parecoxib groups, compared to morphine, after electrical stimulation. These studies demonstrated that tramadol and parecoxib can produce analgesia in dogs with insignificant side effects. The efficacy of tramadol appears to vary with the type of noxious stimulus. A complete prevention of noxious input by administration of analgesics pre- and post-operatively could have important clinical applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analgesics</field><field name="subject">anaesthesia</field><field name="subject">pain relief</field><field name="subject">dog surgery</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300502 Anaesthesiology and intensive care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/864</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of banking policy in Australia: The Wallis Inquiry, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the "four pillars" policy</field><field name="creator">Bakir, Caner, 1970-</field><field name="description">Abstract not available</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banks and banking -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Financial services industry -- Australia -- State supervision</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/7574</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioprocess development for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) synthesis in aqueous/organic two-phase system</field><field name="creator">Gunawan, Cindy, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">(R)-phenylacetylcarbinol or R-PAC is a chiral precursor for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. PAC is produced through biotransformation of pyruvate and benzaldehyde catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) enzyme. The present research project aims at characterizing a two-phase aqueous/organic process for enzymatic PAC production. In a comparative study of several selected yeast PDCs, the highest PAC formation was achieved in systems with relatively high benzaldehyde concentrations when using C. utilis PDC. C. tropicalis PDC was associated with the lowest by-product acetoin formation although it also produced lower PAC concentrations. C. utilis PDC was therefore selected as the biocatalyst for the development of the two-phase PAC production. From an enzyme stability study it was established that PDC deactivation rates in the twophase aqueous/octanol-benzaldehyde system were affected by: (1) soluble octanol and benzaldehyde in the aqueous phase, (2) agitation rate, (3) aqueous/organic interfacial area, and (4) initial enzyme concentration. PDC deactivation was less severe in the slowly stirred phase-separated system (low interfacial area) compared to the rapidly stirred emulsion system (high interfacial area), however the latter system was presumably associated with a faster rate of organic-aqueous benzaldehyde transfer. To find a balance between maintaining enzyme stability while enhancing PAC productivity, a two-phase system was designed to reduce the interfacial contact by decreasing the organic to aqueous phase volume ratio. Lowering the ratio from 1:1 to 0.43:1 resulted in increased overall PAC production at 4??C and 20??C (2.5 M MOPS, partially purified PDC) with a higher concentration at the higher temperature. The PAC was highly concentrated in the organic phase with 212 g/L at 0.43:1 in comparison to 111 g/L at 1:1 ratio at 20??C. The potential of further two-phase process simplification was evaluated by reducing the expensive MOPS concentration to 20 mM (pH controlled at 7.0) and employment of whole cell PDC. It was found that 20??C was the optimum temperature for PAC production in such a system, however under these conditions lowering the phase ratio resulted in decreased overall PAC production. Two-phase PAC production was relatively low in 20 mM MOPS compared to biotransformations in 2.5 M MOPS. Addition of 2.5 M dipropylene glycol (DPG) into the aqueous phase with 20 mM MOPS at 0.25:1 ratio and 20??C improved the production with organic phase containing 95 g/L PAC. Although the productivity was lower, the system may have the benefit of a reduction in production cost.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzymes - Biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Ephredine</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Chemistry, Organic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25711</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The acoustics of the steel string guitar</field><field name="creator">Inta, Ra Ata, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">To improve the replication of acoustic guitars, measurements of three Martin OOO style steel-string guitars were made at various stages of their construction.

Heterologous expression of a variety of microbial natural compounds has been used to harness their diversity and facilitate their combinatorial biosynthesis. However, these genetic techniques have not been developed for secondary metabolite-producing cyanobacteria. Therefore the genetically manipulable Escherichia coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered in order to develop effective heterologous hosts and promoters for the expression of cyanobacterial-derived compounds. The phosphopanthetheinyl transferase (PPT), Sppt, from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was characterised to determine its ability to activate carrier proteins from secondary metabolite pathways. Despite in silico evidence which suggested Sppt was able to activate a wide range of carrier proteins, biochemical analysis revealed that it is dedicated for fatty acid synthesis. Consequently, E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered to encode a broad-range PPT, from the filamentous cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena NSOR10, for the activation of carrier proteins from nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Cyanobacterial natural product engineering was also explored with the characterisation of two relaxed specificity adenylation domains (A-domains) from the biosynthetic pathway of the toxin microcystin. The wide variety of microcystin compounds produced by cyanobacterial species suggests that multiple amino acids can be activated by the same A-domain. This was supported by preliminary ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays and was subsequently harnessed in the production of a variety of dipeptides using two reconstituted modules in vitro. Transposition was investigated as a potential mechanism for the transfer of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters to heterologous hosts. This was performed via the characterisation of the putative transposase, Mat, physically linked with the microcystin synthetase gene cluster (mcyS). PCR screening, in silico analysis and nitrocellulose filter binding assays indicated that this transposase may have mediated mcyS gene cluster rearrangements but not entire gene cluster mobilisation between species. The potential role of transposases in the natural combinatorial biosynthesis of microcystin has evolutionary implications for the dynamic nature of cyanobacterial genomes and applications for use in the engineering of novel bioactive compounds. Therefore, the results from this study may provide a biotechnological platform for the transfer, expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of novel cyanobacterial-derived natural products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphopantetheinyl transferase</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Transposase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41533</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The (Un) Balancing Act: The impact of culture on women engineering students' gendered and professional identities</field><field name="creator">Powell, Abigail , Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of the engineering culture on women engineering students??? gendered and professional identities. It is simultaneously focused on exploring how identity shapes, and is shaped by, women???s experiences of the engineering culture and, the relationship between gendered and professional  identities.  The research is set within the context of existing research on women in engineering, much of which has focused either on women???s experiences in industry or experiences of staff in academia, failing to recognise the importance of higher education (HE) as a gatekeeper to the engineering professions. Furthermore, despite numerous initiatives aimed at increasing the percentage of women entering engineering, the proportion of women studying engineering has remained stable, around fifteen percent, for the last few years.  The research is grounded in an interpretivist approach, although it adopts a multimethod research design. Specifically it draws upon qualitative interviews with 43 women and 18 men engineering students, a questionnaire with responses from 656 engineering undergraduates and two focus groups with 13 women engineering students from seven departments at one university. These datasets are analysed with the aid of NVivo and SPSS to explore women engineering students??? career choices; women???s experiences of the HE engineering culture; the relationship between engineering education culture and women???s identities; whether there are cultural nuances between engineering disciplines; and, implications for strategies to attract  and retain more women in engineering. Key findings from the research are that women and men make career choices based on similar factors, including the influence of socialisers, knowledge of the engineering professions, skills, ability and attributes, and career rewards. However, the extent to which each of this factors are important is gendered. The research also highlights key characteristics of the HE engineering culture, including competition, camaraderie, gendered humour, intensity, more theoretical than practical, help and support for women students and reinforcement of gender binaries. These findings all suggest that women are assimilated into the engineering culture or, at least, develop coping mechanisms for surviving in the existing culture. These strategies reveal a complex and difficult balancing act between being a woman and being an engineer by claiming a rightful place as an engineer, denying gendered experiences and becoming critical of  other women. The research also tackles two key issues, rarely discussed in the  extant literature. Firstly the help and support women students receive from lecturers  and other staff, and the negative impact this has, and may continue to have, on women. Secondly, the analysis of discipline differences shows that design and technology is significantly different from other engineering disciplines in terms of culture(s) and women???s experiences.  The thesis concludes that women???s enculturation into engineering results in  their ???doing gender??? in a particular way. This means that women???s implicit and explicit  devaluing and rejection of femaleness, fails to challenge the gendered cultures of  engineering and, in many ways, upholds an environment which is hostile to women.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">career choice</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">professionalisation</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salivary IgA responses during the first two years of life: a study of aboriginal and non-aboriginal children</field><field name="creator">Kyaw-Myint, Su Mon</field><field name="description">Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), Streptococcus pneumoniae and
Moraxella catarrhalis are common bacterial agents of otitis media which is a major
cause of morbidity in young children. Mucosal immune responses are an integral part
of the immune defense against middle ear infection and it is known that certain
populations, including Australian Aboriginal children, are highly susceptible to disease.
The current study focussed on the development of the mucosal immunity to the three
bacterial pathogens in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from birth to two years
of age, living in the Kalgoorlie-Boulder region of Western Australia. Salivary and
breast milk IgA levels were measured by the enzyme Linked immunosorbent assay. The
measured IgA levels, combined with socio-economic, demographic and bacteriological
data were analyzed statistically to determine the influential factors on the mucosal IgA
response in these children over time.
This study found that each antigen-specific IgA examined followed a distinct ontogeny
pattern and IgA responses differed significantly according to age, indigenous status and
feeding type. Indoors smoke exposure, maternal smoking, and sibling day care
attendance had some impact on salivary IgA levels in the children. However, household
crowding and the presence of older siblings had the most significant impact on salivary
IgA levels for children of different age groups. These two factors were correlated to
increased nasophayrngeal colonization by H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and M.
catarrhalis and colonization status was also found to influence salivary IgA levels in the
children. No correlation between maternal breast milk IgA levels and child salivary IgA
levels was observed.
The results suggest that the degree of exposure to environmental factors rather than
immunological deficit is responsible for the observed differences in salivary IgA
responses between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and modifying these factors
could lead to a reduction in the burden of otitis media experienced by the children.
Further studies correlating specific salivary IgA levels to diseases such as otitis media
will reveal the role of specific salivary IgA responses in the prevention of infection by
respiratory pathogens.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae</field><field name="subject">immune system</field><field name="subject">IgA</field><field name="subject">Kalgoorlie-Boulder</field><field name="subject">indigenous Australia</field><field name="subject">respiratory pathogens</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20050523.095413</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory of benchmarking</field><field name="creator">Moriarty, John</field><field name="description">Benchmarking is a well established and respected mechanism that contributes to organisational improvement. Its epistemology demonstrates it to be theoretically underdetermined with literature focusing on pragmatism and praxis. Benchmarking's critics hold it to be a-theoretical; failing to provide its practitioners with a reliable basis for distinguishing between effective and ineffective efforts.  The purpose of this thesis is to review Benchmarking's epistemology and identify the necessary or sufficient methodological elements contributing to its effectiveness and to establish them within an acceptable theoretical framework.  A causal approach is applied to the objectives of organisational benchmarking's current definitions and implementation frameworks. The resulting theoretical framework is then validated against current exemplary benchmarking praxis to explain its effectiveness and satisfy historical criticisms. Central to the approach is the application of supervenience and entailment relationships between benchmarking parties within the umbrella of Peircean Causation to determine the feasibility of a benchmarking proposition.  Benchmarking's a priori effectiveness (sufficiency) can be established from an organisational axiom and five logical conditions. This research establishes a new encompassing definition of benchmarking reduces its typology to a single consistent form and establishes an Effective Benchmarking Process that explains current practices and addresses historical criticisms. These logical conditions also explain the effectiveness of empirical frameworks such as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and ISO 9000.  A theoretical foundation for benchmarking provides a platform for extending the theory of organisational improvement. It also has significant potential to enhance organisational sustainability by reducing wasted effort. This research focuses on the causal linkages between benchmarking and organisational sustainability. The research establishes a new definition of benchmarking, specifies necessary and sufficient conditions for its application and frames practitioner efforts within an Effective Benchmarking Process (EBP).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">benchmarking</field><field name="subject">organisations</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">causation</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1085</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modafinil for psychostimulant dependence</field><field name="creator">Shearer, James Douglas, National Drug &amp; Alcohol Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychostimulant dependence is a major public health issue in many parts of the world associated with a wide range of psychological, medical and social problems.  Psychosocial interventions are the mainstay of treatment for psychostimulant problems, although their effectiveness is compromised by poor uptake and compliance. Despite increasing knowledge of the neurobiological consequences of psychostimulant use, no medications to date have been any more successful than placebo in reducing psychostimulant use in dependent patients.  Modafinil is a non-amphetamine type psychostimulant that may have potential as an agonist pharmacotherapy for psychostimulant dependence.  The aim of this thesis was to examine the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of modafinil 200 mg/day over ten weeks plus a four session brief CBT intervention for methamphetamine and cocaine dependence through two concurrent randomised placebo controlled trials.  There were no statistically significant differences between modafinil and placebo in treatment retention, medication adherence, psychostimulant abstinence, psychostimulant craving or severity of psychostimulant dependence.  Methamphetamine-dependent subjects tended to provide more illicit psychostimulant negative urine samples while in treatment than those who received placebo.   There appeared to be a reduction in self-reported days of psychostimulant use among methamphetamine-dependent subjects who received modafinil compared to placebo, but the effect size was too small to be statistically significant in this sample.  The reduction in self-reported psychostimulant use did reach statistical significance in methamphetamine-dependent subjects with no other substance dependence.    Uptake of counselling was the most significant predictor of reduced psychostimulant use post treatment, and the addition of counselling improved the cost-effectiveness of modafinil relative to placebo.    Modafinil appeared to be safe, well-tolerated, and non-reinforcing in this treatment population.  Compared to placebo, there was a significant increase in weight in subjects who completed the 10-week course of treatment, and a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure in methamphetamine-dependent subjects who received modafinil.      The results support further trials of modafinil in methamphetamine-dependent patients, although future trials in cocaine-dependent patients from this treatment population were not likely to be viable.  Modafinil appeared to be modestly effective in reducing, but not stopping, methamphetamine use in selected patients.  Multi-centre trials with larger sample sizes, and measures sensitive enough to detect quantitative changes in psychostimulant use would be needed to confirm the findings.  Blood pressure and weight may be important indicators of clinical outcome, and warrant particular attention in future trials, particularly given the cardio-toxicity of both methamphetamine and cocaine. Strategies to enhance medication adherence including a higher dose and counselling adherence are recommended to improve outcomes.  Given the predominance of behavioural and psychosocial factors in psychostimulant dependence, it is likely that the role of medications such as modafinil will be as an adjunct to psychosocial therapy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmacotherapy</field><field name="subject">Modafinil</field><field name="subject">Psychostimulant dependence</field><field name="subject">Psychopharmacology</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Psychotropic drugs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41423</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pleasure consuming medicine</field><field name="creator">Race, Kane, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pleasure Consuming Medicine investigates the significance of the classification of drugs for conceptions of personhood in the context of consumer citizenship. It examines how drug discourses operate politically to sustain particular notions of personhood and organise bodies. As the normative conception of social life shifts to a discourse of consumer agency and active citizenship, it is argued, drugs come to describe the moral boundaries of a freedom configured around personal consumption. The thesis tracks the parallel rise of two discourses of drug mis/use from the 1970s - a discourse of 'drug abuse' and a discourse of 'patient compliance' - illustrating how these discourses bind personal agency to medical authority through a vocabulary of self-administration. It describes how illicit drugs are constructed as a sign and instance of excessive conformity to consumer culture, and how this excess is opportunistically scooped off and spectacularised to stage an intense but superficial battle between the amoral market and the moral state. Pleasure Consuming Medicine uses a theoretical frame developed from queer theory, corporeal feminism, governmentality studies and cultural studies to explore the political character of drug regimes, tracing some of the ramifications for sex, race, class, and citizenship. Then it turns to the field of gay men's HIV education to conceive some alternative and provisional vocabularies of safety. The thesis develops an argument on the exercise of power in consumer society, with the aim of contributing to cultural and critical understandings of consumption, embodiment, sex, health, and citizenship.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drugs</field><field name="subject">Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Political aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20473</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coal bed methane reservoir simulation studies</field><field name="creator">Karimi, Kaveh, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to perform simulation studies for a specific coal bed methane reservoir. First, the theory and reservoir engineering aspects of coal bed methane reservoirs, such as dual porosity concept, permeability characteristics of CBM reservoirs and mechanism of gas storage and gas transportation in CBM reservoir have been discussed. Next, simulation results for the CBM reservoir presented. Simulation studies were carried out by using the CBM reservoir simulator, SIMED II. Injection/fall-off test pressure data were interpreted based on the pressure history matching method. The interpretation results include the determination of reservoir permeability and identification of the reservoir altered zone. Also available production histories were used to simulate the reservoir production behavior. Then the production model was used to predict the reservoir future production and to carry out sensitivity analysis on reservoir performance. For natural pressure depletion, methane recovery was increased significantly as reservoir permeability was increased. Well-bore fracturing creates a fractured zone with higher permeability. This increases methane production rate during early time of reservoir life. Reservoir matrix porosity has a significant effect on the reservoir performance. Higher production peak rate and also higher methane recovery was obtained for the reservoir with lower porosity values. Any increase in the reservoir compressibility causes greater reduction in reservoir absolute permeability as well as relative permeability to gas throughout the reservoir. Therefore, methane recovery decreased as the reservoir compressibility increased. The reservoir production behavior was strongly affected by changes in reservoir size. The production peak rate was significantly postponed and lowered as reservoir size was increased. The effect of reservoir initial pressure was investigated and the results show that higher initial reservoir pressure leads to higher production rate during early years of production. However, for the later years of reservoir life, the production profile is almost identical for different initial pressures. Coal desorption time constant affects the methane production by its own scale. In this study, the range of desorption time did not exceed longer than three days and therefore the difference in production rate was observed only in the first few days of production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coalbed methane</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22449</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS in China: a case study for the engendering of human security discourse</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Anna</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Since the 1990s, the discourse of security has undergone profound change. Rather than merely pertaining to a more traditional, narrow interpretation of security primarily focusing on nation-states instead of people, a human dimension, known as human security has been added. While such discussions on human security have attempted to encompass threats to humanity as a whole, interpretations of such threats have largely failed to recognise the exceptional threats faced by women. Although threats found in analytical discussions of human security do relate to women, it is imperative that a sharper focus be placed on the additional threats women face in terms of their security; ones that might become blurred in general discourse, such as economic, educational and employment disparities, gender discrimination, substandard healthcare, restricted access to healthcare facilities, human trafficking and male violence.This dissertation seeks to provide a gendered analysis of human security, using women in China as its focus. To provide a focused examination, it takes a global source of human insecurity, HIV/AIDS, and examines why women in China are increasingly at risk from HIV/AIDS. In addition to assessing the impact that this pandemic poses for their security, it also attempts to investigate the social impacts HIV/AIDS is having on women in China and what measures the government has put in place to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS. The extent and nature of the role played by intergovernmental organisations (IGOs), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) in China&#8217;s HIV/AIDS epidemic is also explored. This research was prompted by the limited nature of a gendered analysis in the mainstream human security literature, and the need to identify the unique threats to human security faced by women. The realisation that the &#8216;disempowered status&#8217; of women increases their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and that HIV/AIDS is becoming a major source of insecurity for many women around the world (and in China in particular), provides a relevant focus for such an investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">human security</field><field name="subject">gender inequality</field><field name="subject">HIV transmission</field><field name="subject">the People's Republic of China</field><field name="subject">gender roles</field><field name="subject">enabling environments</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00005238/</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Getting into the guts of a salty problem : poor animal production from saltbush pastures is due to inefficient rumen fermentation</field><field name="creator">Mayberry, Dianne</field><field name="description">The main hypothesis tested in this thesis was that poor animal production from saltbush pastures is due to the negative effects of high sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl) on the ruminal environment, and subsequent effects on microbial populations and products of rumen fermentation. This main hypothesis was tested in two experiments. In the first experiment (Chapter Four) the effects of saltbush and a formulated high-salt diet on the ruminal environment and microbial populations were measured over 24-hours following feeding. Feeding both the saltbush and high-salt diet increased the salinity of the rumen fluid, but the formulated high-salt diet caused a decrease in ruminal pH while the saltbush caused an increase. This resulted in differences in the composition of the ruminal microbial populations between the sheep fed different diets. In the second experiment (Chapter Five) the effects of saltbush and a formulated highsalt diet on rumen fermentation were measured. Sheep fed saltbush had inefficient rumen fermentation and this was only partially explained by the high salt content of the diet. Diets containing high levels of NaCl and KCl provided low levels of net energy to sheep, but sheep fed saltbush lost more energy as methane and faecal energy compared to sheep fed the formulated high-salt diet. Inefficient rumen fermentation could help to explain poor animal production from saltbush pastures. Energy supplements such as barley grain can improve the value of saltbush pastures as feed for sheep, but there is no information on how much supplement is required. A third experiment (Chapter Six) was designed to test the hypothesis that there would be an optimal amount of barley required to improve the efficiency of rumen fermentation in sheep fed saltbush. Barley and straw were combined in a pellet and substituted for saltbush at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% of the maintenance ration. Feeding barley and straw improved the efficiency of rumen fermentation in sheep fed saltbush, with an optimal level of supplementation at 60% of the maintenance diet. This is likely to be lower (approximately 20% of maintenance) if barley is fed without straw.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feed utilization efficiency -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Effect of salt on -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Sheep -- Feeding and feeds -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Rumen fermentation</field><field name="subject">Salt-bush -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Barley as feed -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Sheep nutrition</field><field name="subject">Methane production</field><field name="subject">Saltbush</field><field name="subject">Atriplex nummularia</field><field name="subject">Methane production</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0071</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the experiences of gifted preschool and primary age children</field><field name="creator">Grubb, Karen Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This research is a Case Study of the experiences of two groups of gifted children, including two preschoolers (3-5 years old) and three primary age children (6 - 9 years old), and their families in Victoria.

A Semiotic Study of the Interpretation of Western Brand Images in China</field><field name="creator">Fu, Linda</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to shed some light on the study and practice of visual communication
across cultural boundaries, Using a semiotic approach, it examines how a selected
range of Western brand images that are promoted in the People's Republic of China are
'read' and interpreted by the local urban population. The case studies include symbolic
images, such as logomarks and logotypes, as well as iconic images such as
photographic material in advertisements. The political, economic and social context,
and cultural aspects, such as attitudes, values and various cultural codes, are
considered as influencing factors tha t affect the decoding of the meaning of visual
unages.
The research indicates that the intended and perceived meanings of a branding image
rarely match when there is a significant difference between the cultures in which the
image is encoded and decoded. While in a few instances the local population interprets
the Western brand images in the manner intended by the Western communicator, most
are interpreted differently. Some images are interpreted with a positive, albeit
different, connotation, others are seen as rather negative. In the worst-case scenario,
the messages are severely misunderstood and totally rejected by the readers due to
cultural incompatibility.
Rather unexpectedly, symbolic images, acknowledged as arbitrary and culture-specific
in nature, are more readily interpreted in a positive way and close to the intended
meaning than are the iconic images. The latter tend to be interpreted almost exclusively
in the reader's (rather than the author's) cultural context and thus may be prone to
misunderstanding or even rejection.
The thesis concludes that the challenge in communicating visually across cultural
boundaries is to recognise cultural differences, and draw on cultural compatibility to
generate shared meaning and avoid cultural clashes that cause negative interpretation</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross cultural</field><field name="subject">visual communication</field><field name="subject">semiotic</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">logo</field><field name="subject">brand image</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090605.155440</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three essays on ownership concentration in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Haiyan</field><field name="description">There are two competing theoretical debates about the impact of ownership concentration on organisational outcomes, namely efficient-monitoring hypothesis and conflict-of-interest (strategic-alignment) hypothesis. New Zealand has a distinctively concentrated ownership structure. This raises an important research question: Does concentrated ownership in New Zealand perform an efficient monitoring or opportunistic function? This question remains unanswered due to the very limited research on ownership structure in New Zealand. This research considers three specific where studying the function of ownership concentration is likely to be insightful. Three contexts are: CEO compensation scheme, corporate voluntary disclosures and investor perception of ownership structure in the stock market. This research further contributes to the existing literature by decomposing ownership into four mutually exclusive groups, namely financial institution-, government-, management- and other company-controlled ownership structures. The different impacts of ownership concentration under each type of controlling ownership structure are investigated.  The findings of Essay One reveal that concentrated ownership is a significant contributor to the poor CEO compensation pay-for-performance relationship in New Zealand listed companies. However, reduced ownership concentration promotes the alignment between CEO compensation and firm performance. These results imply that large shareholders in New Zealand do not play a monitoring role in curbing managerial power; rather it exacerbates the poor relationship between CEO compensation and firm performance. In Essay Two, regression results show that companies characterised by financial institution-controlled ownership structure tend to make significantly fewer (more) disclosures at high (low) concentration levels. In contrast, firm observations in the high concentration group with government- and management-controlled ownership structures have considerably higher voluntary disclosure scores compared with their low concentration counterparts. With respect to the linearity assumption, the relationship between ownership concentration and voluntary disclosure practices unveil a non-linear pattern, indicating that the efficiency of large shareholders&#8217; monitoring varies with the level of intensity of ownership concentration.  The results of Essay Three demonstrate that ownership concentration in general is positively associated with information asymmetry observed around annual report release date. This is supportive of investor-adverse selection towards ownership concentration, and such an adverse selection problem is strongly associated with financial institutional and managerial shareholdings. Also, ownership concentration decreases stock liquidity, so no result is found in line with the ownership concentration liquidity hypothesis. When voluntary disclosure is taken into account, regression results suggest that disclosure significantly attenuates information asymmetry risk related to ownership concentration. This effect is particularly pronounced for firms with management-controlled ownership structure. Findings highlight the importance of corporate disclosures under concentrated ownership structure in eliminating information asymmetry and enhancing market efficiency in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ownership concentration</field><field name="subject">ownership structure</field><field name="subject">CEO compensation pay-for-performance relationship</field><field name="subject">corporate voluntary disclosure</field><field name="subject">information asymmetry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340203 Finance economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/974</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double jeopardy: occupational injury and rehabilitation of temporary agency workers</field><field name="creator">Underhill, Elsa, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the occupational health and safety risks facing labour hire employees (also known as temporary agency workers) in the Australian state of Victoria. Three questions are considered. First do labour hire employees face greater risk of injury and disease than direct hire employees? Second, if so, which characteristics of labour hire employment contribute to a higher rate of injury? Third, what characteristics of labour hire employment reduce the likelihood of injured employees returning to work and being rehabilitated?  The first question is answered by an aggregate analysis of data drawn from all workers' compensation claim files in Victoria between 1994/5 and 2000/1 contrasting the frequency of injury for both temporary agency employees and direct hire employees. Second a unique sub sample of individual investigated claim files was then examined to test employment factors that could account for the higher frequency of injury amongst agency workers. A third data source involved a survey and focus groups of temporary agency workers. This provided supplementary data on the work experiences of labour hire employees.  A number of conclusions are drawn. Labour hire employees are more likely to be injured at work than their direct hire counterparts. Factors explaining this include economic pressures, disorganisation at the host workplace, and regulatory failure for agency employees. Several of these factors are uniquely related to the triangular nature of labour hire arrangements. Once injured at work, labour hire employees are especially disadvantaged relative to direct hire employees through the reluctance of many labour hire employers to offer further employment. This reduces the capacity of labour hire workers to return to meaningful employment. Regulatory failure stemming from both employment and occupational health and safety legislation underpins the greater likelihood of agency workers being injured at work and then dispensed with by employers. Until the uniqueness of their triangular relationship with employers and hosts is recognised through appropriate regulatory intervention, their greater occupational health and safety risks will not be overcome.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workplace injury.</field><field name="subject">Temporary agency workers.</field><field name="subject">Occupational health and safety.</field><field name="subject">Return to work.</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41099</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The research and design of a two-seater lounge</field><field name="creator">Machaalani, Roland, Department of Industrial Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">To document the design, prototype and manufacture of a lounge, which stimulates communication and human interaction. The lounge will also question conventional seating arrangements, and redefine how two people can sit in relation to each other, converse, interact and exchange body language.  The process began with an initial design sketch, and producing a prototype. This step was required, as it was the starting point for the major project. It provided me with an initial design to criticize and improve on.  The major project is intended to test the validity of the initial design, analyse the markets, and improve the design in relation to ergonomic issues, material/manufacturing resolution and produce a marketing plan.  The next stage of the process was the gathering and analysis of relevant information in order to redefine the design brief. This involved preliminary research into marketing, ergonomics, materials and manufacturing processes.  With the design brief now established, concepts were prepared and compared against the products criteria. The design solution which best met the criteria was further detailed and developed.  Finally, a business plan was put together to test the commercial viability of the lounge.

The technique uses separate numerical simulations of the fluid flow and the ultrasound propagation within a meter duct.  A new flow meter geometry has been developed, having a significantly improved (smooth and monotonic) calibration curve.  In this work the complex fluid flow field and its influence on the propagation of ultrasound in a cylindrical flow meter duct is investigated.  A geometric acoustics (ray tracing) propagation model is applied to a flow field calculated by a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package.  The simulation results are compared to measured calibration curves for a variety of meter geometries having varying lengths and duct diameters.  The modelling shows reasonable agreement to the calibration characteristics for several meter geometries over a Reynolds number range of 100...100000 (based on bulk velocity and meter duct diameter).  Various CFD simulations are validated against flow visualisation measurements, Laser Doppler Velocimetry measurements or published results.  The thesis includes software to calculate the acoustic ray propagation and also to calculate the optimal shape for the annular gap around the transducer housings in order to achieve desired flow acceleration.  A dimensionless number is proposed to characterise the mean deflection of an acoustic beam due to interaction with a fluid flow profile (or acoustic velocity gradient).  For flow in a cylindrical duct, the 'acoustic beam deflection number' is defined as  M g* (L/D)^2, where: M is the Mach Number of the bulk velocity; g* is the average non-dimensionalised velocity gradient insonified by the acoustic beam (g* is a function of transducer diameter - typically g* = 0.5...4.5); L is the transducer separation; and D is the duct diameter.  Large values of this number indicate considerable beam deflection that may lead to undesirable wall reflections and diffraction effects.  For a single path coaxial transducer ultrasonic flow meter, there are practical limits to the length of a flow meter and to the maximum size of a transducer for a given duct diameter.  The 'acoustic beam deflection number' characterises the effect of these parameters.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrasonic flow meter</field><field name="subject">ultrasonic flowmeter</field><field name="subject">flow meter shape</field><field name="subject">flow meter geometry</field><field name="subject">ray tracing</field><field name="subject">geometric acoustics</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">cfd</field><field name="subject">flow meters</field><field name="subject">ultrasonics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22044</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring quality outcomes in patient care: the example of trauma services</field><field name="creator">Willis, Cameron David</field><field name="description">As healthcare and health systems become increasingly complex, expectations of what constitutes high quality care continue to evolve.  Stakeholders now require contemporary and meaningful measures of system performance.  As such, valid healthcare quality metrics are rapidly becoming essential for those providing and receiving healthcare to assess performance and motivate change.  This thesis investigates the utility of quality indicators in trauma care.  Multiple in-hospital indicators have been promulgated by various bodies for assessing quality of trauma care.  The properties of ideal indicators have been widely documented however few published data have reported these properties for many trauma measures.  The emphasis on trauma process measures (eg. time to interventions) highlights the need for indicators with known links to patient outcomes.  This process-outcome link may be viewed as a measure of an indicator&#8217;s construct validity.  As this property is unknown for many trauma indicators, this thesis focuses on the construct validity of a number of routinely utilised trauma indicators. In this thesis, the available in-hospital indicators proposed by The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and additional indicators used in the Victorian State Trauma System were investigated for their relationships with patient outcomes.  A small number of indicators were found to have statistically significant relationships with patient outcomes, however many indicators demonstrated counter-intuitive relationships, whereby high quality care was linked with poorer patient outcomes.  These results suggested that links between indicators and outcomes may not be best measured using individual indicators for individual patients.  Rather, a strategy for measuring patient outcomes at the hospital level may be needed.  To combine multiple indicators into a single measure of hospital level performance, a number of composite methods were explored using two trauma registries.  Three composite weighting schemes were employed.  As composite measures are often used for provider ranking or benchmarking, the stability of hospital ranks between providers and over time was investigated.  The composites were found to have moderate to strong correlations (0.76-0.99) however variability in composite hospital rankings existed, particularly for middle ranking facilities.  The construct validity of each available indicator and composite score was investigated through the relationship with hospital level risk-adjusted mortality using Poisson regression models, risk adjusting for expected deaths using the TRISS formulation.  Each composite measure demonstrated a significant association with mortality, with the mortality decrease across the middle 50% of each composite score ranging from 12.06% &#8211; 16.13%.  These findings suggest that complex measures such as trauma composite indices may be better able to measure the interactions between processes within complex systems that influence quality of care.  This thesis adds valuable insight into the use of indicators for assessing quality of care in trauma systems.  The combination of individual indicators into composite forms appears to strengthen the construct validity of these measures.  By demonstrating the process-outcome link for trauma composite indices, this thesis has identified a means of utilising process measures to assess hospital level performance that may become important for future public reporting and hospital funding schemes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality</field><field name="subject">Indicators</field><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="subject">Patient care</field><field name="subject">Health systems</field><field name="subject">Healthcare</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/62206</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creativity in the bioglobal age: sociological prospects from seriality to contingency</field><field name="creator">Huthnance, Neil Peter, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is the first dedicated sociological attempt to offer a critical response to cultural studies and allied discourses that concern themselves with the relationship between technology and violence. A critical reconstruction is necessary because these cultural theorists have failed to adequately contextualize their arguments in relation to both the globally ascendant neoliberal policy outlook and its associated social Darwinian technoculture: the combined pernicious effects of which could be described as the logic of ???social constructionism as social psychosis???. The most prominent manifestation of this theoretical psychosis has to do with an interest in biotechnology in particular. The problem I identify in the treatment of this theme is how easily it can be used to support a technologically determinist position. One undesirable side effect is that these determinists are able to project from present trends a dystopian exhaustion of all critique through their focus on violence. In the thesis of ???bioglobalism??? this state of affairs is also deployed to take sociologists to task for insufficient recognition of processual ???network??? forms of distributed agency in technological processes. At stake therefore is the recovery of sociological critique. It follows that the core of my thesis is the radical reworking of two related heuristic devices: seriality and contingency. Seriality is taken to refer to social practices as diverse as the possible relationships between the social problem of rationality, case studies of individuals who have run amok, and the functioning of network characteristics. I use contingency to eschew seriality???s deterministic accounting of the social. Here I propose a new conceptual relationship between creativity and action. Emphasis is accordingly placed upon two related normative projects: Raymond Williams???s cultural materialism, and three of the ???problematiques??? Peter Wagner has identified as inescapable for theorizing modernity: the continuity of the acting person, the certainty of knowledge, and the viability of the political order. I conclude with a renewed conception of the role of normative critique as a form of conceptual therapy for bioglobal projections of seriality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative ability - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Technology - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Social change</field><field name="subject">Biology - Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Crime - Sociological aspects</field><field name="subject">Contingency (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25954</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composite fouling of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate in a dynamic seawater reverse osmosis unit</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yuan, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) causes serious processing problems and limits the productivity of seawater reverse osmosis (RO) desalination. The interactions between CaSO4 and CaCO3 in the dynamic seawater RO systems have been neglected previously because conventional studies mainly focused on individual compounds or mixed compounds in batch systems. The present work evaluates composite fouling behavior of CaSO4 and CaCO3 in a dynamic RO unit. The fouling experiments were performed at constant pressure and velocity by a partial recycling mode which permeate was withdrawn from the system during the recirculation of retentate to simulate the increasing of water recovery level. The fouling phenomena were monitored by the decline of flux. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a combination of elemental dispersive x-ray microanalysis (EDS), and x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the morphological features, chemical compositions and crystalline phases of foulants. The interactions of CaSO4 and CaCO3 were investigated by the comparison between individual CaSO4 or CaCO3 fouling and composite fouling, and by varying SO42-/HCO3- molar ratio of the feed. A recently developed approach, Scaling Potential Index (SPI) incorporated with measured concentration polarization modulus (CP), for assessing the fouling tendency of inorganic salts on the membrane surface was validated in the dynamic tests. In addition, the effectiveness of two generic scale inhibitors, polyacrylic acid (molecular weight =2100, PA) and sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) were evaluated. Some of the highlights of the obtained results are as follows: ??????The precipitation kinetics, morphology and adhesive strength of composite scales were different from pure precipitates ??????CaSO4 precipitated as gypsum while CaCO3 precipitated as two crystalline phases: calcite and aragonite ??????The crystalline phases as well as precipitation kinetics were affected by SO42-/HCO3- ratio ??????Scaling Potential Index was able to predict the fouling tendency of CaSO4 and CaCO3 accurately ??????The dosage of PA and SHMP was effective to mitigate fouling Results of this work are significant, not only because they have made contribution to the fundamental understanding of composite inorganic fouling in RO membrane systems which was ignored previously, but also because they may play a key role in the development of scale control.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calcium sulphate</field><field name="subject">Calcium carbonate</field><field name="subject">Reverse osmosis</field><field name="subject">Saline water conversion</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26007</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the credit default swap market</field><field name="creator">Wang, Peipei, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The focus of this dissertation is the European Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) market. CDSs are the most popular credit derivative products. Three issues are discussed, the first, which is covered in chapter 2, is the investigation of non-diversifiable jump risk in iTraxx sector indices based on a multivariate model that explicitly admits discrete common jumps for an index and its components. Our empirical research shows that both the iTraxx Non-Financials and their components experience jumps during the sample period, which means that the jump risks in the iTraxx sector index are not diversifiable. The second issue, which is covered in chapter 3 is the component structure of credit default swap spreads and their determinants. We firstly extract a transitory component and a persistent component from two different maturities of the Markit iTraxx index and then regress these components against proxies for several commonly used explanatory variables. Our results show that these explanatory variables have significant but differing impacts on the extracted components, which indicates that a two-factor formulation may be needed to model CDS options.  The last issue, which is covered in chapters 4, 5 and 6 is the investigation of the linkage between the credit default swap market and the equity market within the European area. We innovatively calibrate the CDS option with the Heston Model to get the implied volatility in the CDS market, which allows us to investigate both the characteristic of implied volatility in the CDS market and the relationship of the two markets not only on the level of daily changes but also with regard to its second moment.  Our analysis shows that the stock market weakly leads the CDS market on daily changes but for implied volatility, the stock market leads the CDS market. A VECM analysis shows that only the stock market contributes to price discovery. For sub-investment grade entities, the interactivities between the implied volatility of the CDS market and the implied volatility of the stock market are stronger, especially during the recent credit crunch period.  All these results have important implications for the construction of portfolios with credit-sensitive instruments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jump risk.</field><field name="subject">Credit default swap.</field><field name="subject">Kalman filter.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43722</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethics of reproductive choice : genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Morrigan, Viviane, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">For this project I describe the socio-historical development of a particular application of genetic prenatal diagnosis, in terms of changing social relations that govern an ethics of reproductive choice. I examine ways that medicine and government articulate prenatal diagnosis to problematise the maternal body and govern women's reproductive choices about chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. Since its introduction in the early 1970s, the major use of prenatal diagnosis has been to detect chromosomal abnormalities-in particular, Down syndrome-in the fetus. Medico-scientific knowledge claims negotiated in everyday practices in the genetic counselling clinic between health professionals and their clients are situated within broader social relations. Negotiations between medicine and government have produced technoscientific possibilities, realised with greater or lesser success in the co-construction of a workable prenatal diagnosis standardised package. I describe how these socio-technical relations have produced similarities and differences across time, and national and professional boundaries. My analysis draws on observations in three genetic counselling clinics, and of the health professionals' other work activities. I also draw on interviews with them and other actors in that arena, as well as claims made about prenatal diagnosis technologies in the medico-scientific literature. I analyse my data using concepts developed in social worlds/arenas theory within a Foucauldian framework of social relations that govern the body. Since the early formation of a standardised package of genetic counselling about amniocentesis, ethical decisions about prenatal diagnosis have identified multiple parts of the self to be governed. This ethics has relied on a duty to make genetically responsible decisions as a particular way to relate to oneself, although it has been expressed in different ways. Newer technologies have articulated greater ethical possibilities for governing the self by co-constructing new ways of assembling the constituent components. Throughout, there have been tensions between two major aims for governing the self: that of giving birth to a healthy baby, and that of managing maternal rationality in order to act as an autonomous rational individual. I have thus described how a woman's use of prenatal diagnosis is not simply one of individual choice. Her decision is a complex ethical one that is historically and socially contingent on relations between medicine and government that present the maternal body in certain ways for her to act upon herself.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human reproduction -- Moral and ethical aspects</field><field name="subject">Genetic counselling</field><field name="subject">Prenatal diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19396</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for sustainable building tools</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yu, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sustainable building (SB) tools have been recognized and explored in different regions as among the most effective means to encourage, regulate and assist SB development. A large variety of SB tools have been developed and applied in the marketplace, while a number of new tools emerge each year. While the early-developed SB tools provide general references and resources, it is still not easy either to select from existing tools, to develop new tools, or to customize existing tools for any specific region. On the one hand, the quickly expanding number of tools is developed with different styles, contents, functions, underlying assumptions as well as limitations relating to the specific conditions in their origin regions. Without a comprehensive framework to classify the tools, it is difficult to select the right ones out for any specific task in hand. On the other hand, the conditions and requirements for developing SB tools in a specific region are multi-faceted and complex. Without a proper understanding of them from a holistic point of view, it is difficult to say which tools or which type of tools are indeed needed and appropriate in a region. Recognizing the demand for developing and applying specific SB tools in different regions and the confusion surrounding existing tools, this research establishes two comprehensive conceptual frameworks to classify SB tools and SB issues. The framework for SB tools includes four related categories that focus on building stakeholders, building activities, buildings, and building performances. The framework for SB issues constitutes two combined hierarchy structures each for the performance (P) factors and the decision-making (D) factors respectively. These two frameworks not only serve as guides toward identifying the types of tools (existing or not) that are needed and suitable in a specific region, but also facilitate the selection and customization of existing tools for specific regions.  Guided by the two generic frameworks established in the research, China specific conditions and requirements for SB tools are investigated. China specific SB issues are first identified from three preliminary SB tools in the country and classified according to the generic frameworks for SB issues. A questionnaire survey targeting local architects is then conducted in four selected cities. Answers in the replied questionnaires are analysed with the SPSS software and the Content Analysis method. Local architects??? perception about the relative importance of SB issues and their preferences and expectation about the characters, orientations, functions and styles of SB tools are identified and compared with that in existing SB tools. Accordingly, similarities and contradictions between existing tools and local architects??? perceptions, preferences, and expectations regarding China specific SB tools are summarized and discussed. Synthesizing the above research and investigation about the generic and regionally specific aspects of SB tools, this thesis finally proposes a holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools. First, a more balanced approach for developing SB tools in both the broad and narrow senses is proposed and discussed; second, a suite approach for developing SB tools in both the functional and spatial dimensions is proposed and discussed. Conceptual frameworks are established in the discussions; examples are provided to illustrate the concepts; and recommendations are made for further development of the generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools in China.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable buildings</field><field name="subject">sustainable architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22919</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AUTOMATED Gmax MEASUREMENT TO EXPLORE DEGRADATION OF ARTIFICIALLY CEMENTED CARBONATE SAND</field><field name="creator">Mohsin, AKM</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bender Element, Small Strain Stiffness, Gmax, Cement Degradation, Shear Stiffness, Toyoura Sand, Carbonate Sand, Cemented Sand, Hall Effect Transducer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analyzing Bank Negara Malaysia's Behaviour in Formulating Monetary Policy: An Empirical Approach</field><field name="creator">Shaari, Mohamad Hasni</field><field name="description">Existing studies which analyze a central banks' behaviour in formulating monetary
policy, are mostly concentrated on the experience of developed economies. However, developing economies face a different institutional structure, as well as a different set of constraints and shocks, hence, it would be interesting to analyze how a central bank under this different economic environment performs its monetary policy mandate. This thesis looks at the behaviour of Bank Negara Malaysia (The Central Bank of Malaysia) in formulating monetary policy in Malaysia during the period 1975-2005. 
&#182;
There are four major aspects of Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) policy behaviour that are examined in this thesis. Firstly, with regard to its policy reaction function - does BNM set interest rates according to some form of policy rule or purely on a discretionary manner? After identifying the systematic component of its policy action, we try to establish BNM's policy objectives and preferences. This will help in understanding the
rationale behind its policy action. The third aspect is whether BNM's policy behaviour changes over time. Lastly, with the use of an estimated Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, we conduct some policy experiments to observe the possible impact on the Malaysia's economic outcomes were BNM to behave differently to what we envisaged its policy behaviour has been.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monetary policy</field><field name="subject">central bank</field><field name="subject">policy preferences</field><field name="subject">DSGE model</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090603.134826</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE MAINTENANCE OF THE FRIULAN-ITALIAN
COMMUNITY IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Bal, Louise</field><field name="description">The aim of the study was to develop an in-depth understanding of the migration
experiences of the Italian community of Australia, with a case study of the regional
Friulan community of Sydney. For the ways in which people identify themselves at
different times and in different environments may not always be consistent. The purpose
of the study was to add to the exploration of the diversity, cultural variety and richness
cultural communities have brought to Australia. The study set out to fulfill an important
function in adding to the accounts of the diversity of ethnic groups in Australia, their
structure and cultural backgrounds and the values of family members. Since culture is
concerned with meaning, there is of course a very close relationship between culture and
language, through which kin relationships, obligations and duties are expressed and
appropriate behaviour defined. It is that meaning and relationship that led me to
investigate the Italian and Friulan communities.
The study took on the form of an ethnography enabling me, the researcher, to participate
in order to develop an in depth understanding of the experiences of the Italian migrants,
in particular the Friulan community. The data was collected by using key informant
interviewing. The participants were encouraged to freely reflect on their past and present
experiences to enable them to make a comparative analysis of their experiences in
Australia and in their country of origin. This enabled the migrants to take on the role of
culturally knowledgeable informants supplying information which was significant to them
and which reflected their perceptions of their life experiences. The data has been
faithfully recorded to represent the immigrant's point of view.
The study revealed that many of the first and second-generation are highly involved with
their Italian heritage and operate comfortably with a bicultural ethnic identity. The
second generation have reconstructed the Italian-Australian family, thus changing the
Italian community and providing links between the Italian, the Anglo-Australian and the
other ethnic communities. Ethnicity is continually negotiated and is a constant source of
transformation for people of immigrant background. If Italian-Australians continue to
associate, both through family and cultural practices then the Italian-Australian identity
will continue. The big question is what will happen in the third and fourth Italian-Australian
generation. It is here that the question of ethnic and national identity becomes
highly relevant.
Cultural diversity presents challenging issues for Australia: what it means to be an
Australian; the relationship between national and personal identities; identifying and
working in both the cohesive and divisive forces in a multicultural society; and the form
and flavour of a future republic. None of these issues are new, yet all are of immediate
concern, and the symbolic importance of the approach of the twenty-first century invests
them with particular meaning.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Italian</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">cultural diversity</field><field name="subject">immigrant population</field><field name="subject">Friulan community</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Italian migrants</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090609.081955</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Need for Higher Education

Adult and Community
Education Sector
in the ACT</field><field name="creator">Hurrell, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis has as its origins a desire by the Ministerial Advisory Council on Adult
and Community Education in the Australian Capital Territory to learn more about the
sector with whom they interact.
There was a clear perception that, due to its diversity, a strong reliance on volunteers
and an underlying mistrust of beaurocracy, the sector was quite poorly delineated. If
this was in fact the case, then the capacity of the Council to support the sector - for
example through the grants scheme - was being greatly handicapped. In the case of
grants, it was known that requests commonly outnumbered available grant funds by
three or four to one. What was not known was the extent of other worthwhile ACE
activity that was either electing not to apply for funding or was simply unaware that
the facility even existed.
The research, based on the results of a broad ranging questionnaire distributed to all
known ACE providers in the ACT, has furthered the level of understanding of the
sector. The research approach was modeled on the South Australian Pathfinder
Project (1996).
Key findings include that:
? the ACE sector is extremely diverse and active in the ACT;
? it is client focussed in that it develops its programs in response to the
identified needs of its target group(s);
? in the twelve months covered by the survey there were over 190 000
attendees in ACE programs;
? a range of programs are available to most community groups;
? there is a strong reliance on volunteers;
? the sector generally feels that there is a demand for even more programs
than are currently offered;
? many individual providers do not see themselves as part of the overall
ACE sector.
While there are some marked similarities between the ACT ACE sector and the South
Australian findings, there also some clear differences. For example, many of the
factors that restrict access to ACE in other parts of Australia are less relevant to the
ACT. An example of this is that travel distances/times for participants to access
programs are generally less of a problem in the ACT than in some other jurisdictions
due to the small area and the concentration of population in the ACT.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">adult education</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090609.115250</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aude sapere - knowledge management and its implications for strategic management in organisations : an analysis of small and medium enterprises in New Zealand and the United Kingdom based on an original knowledge management model</field><field name="creator">Handtrack, Christian</field><field name="description">This study set out to provide important empirical evidence on the role of knowledge management (KM) within Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in New Zealand and the United Kingdom and to explore how such companies handle their planning and strategic choices. In today&#8217;s knowledge economies the management of knowledge has become vital. In the context of SMEs, this is even more critical because they often operate under difficult conditions and are subject to global pressures from large corporations and demanding customers. In spite of the significance of SMEs as essential for any nation&#8217;s growth and success, and even though many scholars and business managers claim that knowledge management is highly relevant for SMEs, there has been little research about this concept in SMEs, in general, and in New Zealand, in particular. The few studies in the literature conclude that this concept is mostly neglected by SMEs even though it is vital and has high potential benefits for them.  A quantitative research method approach was adopted. Self-completion questionnaires were sent to the senior management of firms with 100 employees or less, from a cross-section of industries. As part of this process an original knowledge management model was developed. The basic research questions were deduced from this model and the items in the questionnaire were created to answer these research questions. In New Zealand, a total of 417 SMEs were contacted by mail and 180 useable questionnaires were returned. In the United Kingdom, 1268 SMEs were contacted and 241 useable responses were received. The response rates of 43.2% in New Zealand, of 19% for the United Kingdom and of 25% in total, are satisfactory. Therefore, the basis of this study was a large (421 responses) and high quality transnational sample, which allowed for sound quantitative analyses. The claim by previous researchers that knowledge management in the SME sector is not yet fully developed appears to be supported by the results of this research. The large majority of respondents regard themselves as not familiar enough with the concept of knowledge management to actually benefit from it in practice. Even though the respondents in both countries seem to appreciate knowledge management as a relevant and useful concept with potential, many do not seem to be sufficiently informed about this concept. Few have a knowledge management initiative in place or are planning or in the process of setting up one. The responses, which vary little between the two sub-samples, point to a short-term rather than a long-term management perspective being dominant. Major barriers in terms of the deliberate creation and sharing of knowledge are a lack of time and higher importance given to daily operational activities. The respondents - predominantly senior managers - indicate that they primarily consider themselves to be responsible for ensuring that knowledge is captured and shared and relatively little responsibility is given to other employees or specialists. SMEs do apply several aspects of knowledge management, however, this is generally informal and with an operational rather than a strategic focus. From the responses it is apparent that knowledge is shared internally mostly via people-based mechanisms. More advanced measures such as the systematic collection, organisation and storage of knowledge are less common. The results indicate a number of differences between the respondents. In this regard it is most evident that the more familiar respondents are with the concept of knowledge management the more proactive they are in terms of managing knowledge on an operational and strategic level. This transnational research strongly links knowledge management to strategy and it clarifies how this concept can impact the formulation of strategy and the strategic competence of SMEs. Therefore, the results add new knowledge to the areas of SME research and strategic knowledge management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="subject">holistic knowledge management model (HKMM)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1089</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing the critical design parameters for reuse</field><field name="creator">Ibbotson, Scott, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Reuse of components as opposed to material recovery, recycling or disposal has been identified as one of the most efficient EOL strategies for products. The concept behind reuse is that some components and subassemblies have a design life that exceeds the life of the product itself. In order for reuse to be successfully implemented as an EOL strategy, a designer needs to incorporate into a product a philosophy of Design for Reuse (DfRe) at the early design stage. Reliable methods to assess the remaining life of used components based on a products usage life are also required. Furthermore, current industry practices and literature advocate that there is no methodology to decide which parameters need to be redesigned so as to change the life of a selected component to a desired level. The objective of this research is to develop a methodology to assess the reuse potential of product groups based on component failure mechanisms and their associated critical lifetime prediction design parameters. Utilising these clustered groups mathematical models were then developed to establish the useful life of the components for each clustered group. Finally, a means of equating useful life to design life was established and the relationship between, the failure mechanisms, critical lifetime prediction design parameters and design life were represented in graphical format. In order to achieve the proposed objective, Cluster analysis, in particular Group Technology (GT) and Hierarchical clustering were employed to group components with similar failure mechanisms. Following this, multiple linear regression was used to establish mathematical models based on condition monitoring data for each of the clustered groups and their related critical lifetime prediction design parameters. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the mathematical models, in order to produce graphical relations between the useful life and design parameters of a product.  The validity of the suggested methodology was tested on electric motors and a gearbox as both these components have demonstrated great reuse potential. The results demonstrate that the methodology can assist designers in estimating the design life and associated design parameters with great accuracy, and subsequently aiding in a stratagem for reuse.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycled products</field><field name="subject">Spare parts</field><field name="subject">Salvage (Waste, etc.) -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in an externally irradiated immobilized catalyst bubble column photoreactor: mass transfer and activity evaluation.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ivy Ai Ling, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Light intensity distribution studies in the heterogeneous photocatalytic reactors were carried out successfully with potassium ferrioxalate chemical actinometry, reproducible light intensity estimates of the irradiation source were obtained. The increased light intensity in the reactor system increased the absorption as determined by actinometry. It was found that reflectivity was a dependent variable but mesh opening area was an independent variable.  The photocatalytic mineralization of dichoroacetic acid DCAA, in the presence of TiO2 immobilized on a plate in an externally irradiated bubble column photoreactor had been investigated. The mass transfer and activity evaluation were measured. It was found that increasing the catalyst thickness, increased the photoactivity until it reaches the optimum loading, further loading increase caused the reaction rate to remain constant. This phenomenon was observed with increased lamp power (intensity) and initial solute concentration. However, the catalyst activity was not influenced by the increasing concentration of dissolved oxygen. The reaction rate for DCAA photomineralization was expressed using the Langmuir-Hinsheldwood model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bubble chambers.</field><field name="subject">Plate towers.</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics.</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous catalysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40828</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling T helper cell activation and development.</field><field name="creator">Jansson, Andreas, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">T helper (Th) cell activation and development is one of the most critical events in regulating the adaptive immune response. Understanding its regulation could be of great therapeutical value as many severe diseases are associated with failure in controlling T cell activation and development. However, the regulation of T cell activation appears to be one of the most complex set of cellular and molecular interactions known in the immune system. There is therefore an urgent need for tools to unravel this complexity, and to make use of the quantitative experimental data. To address this issue, mathematical and computational models, based on rigorous biophysical and kinetic data, were developed to study the specific role of some of the major costimulatory molecules involved in Th cell activation, and others developed to investigate proposed theories about mechanisms involved in Th cell differentiation. The simulations of costimulation reveal new implications for the function of the costimulatory molecules CD28 and CTLA-4, and their ligands B7-1 and B7-2, and show how binding affinity, stoichiometric properties, expression levels, and, in particular, competition effects, all profoundly influence complex formation at the immunological synapse. The results support the concept that B7-2 and B7-1 are the dominant ligands of CD28 and CTLA-4, respectively, and indicate that the inability of B7-2 to recruit CTLA-4 to the synapse cannot be, as has been previously proposed, due to the different binding properties of B7-1 and B7-2. Simulations of Th cell development reveal that both instructive and selective processes are likely to be involved in Th cell differentiation. In addition, further simulations indicate that Th2 cells are more likely to become dominant by inhibiting Th1 cells (negative selection), rather than selecting their own growth (positive selection). This thesis also includes an experimental work in which the immunomodulatory role of the bacterial signalling molecule N-3-(oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL) was analysed. This study strongly suggests that OdDHL suppresses Th cell activation and development, and that it is likely targeting the intracellular signalling events involved in the early stages of Th cell activation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells -- mathematical models -- differentiation -- computer simulation -- mathematical models; cellular signal transduction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/30602</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chain competition</field><field name="creator">Bao, Yong, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the influence of horizontal competition on supply chain performance. Unlike most of the existing literature which focuses on horizontal competition between echelon levels, we look at both the supply chain and the individual company??s performance with the presence of supply chain to supply chain competition.  Specifically, this thesis is composed of three individual research papers.  The first paper deals with chain-to-chain horizontal competition and considers price competition among an arbitrary number of supply chains by comparing two cases. In the first case each supply chain is vertically integrated, while in the second, decentralised, case the manufacturers and retailers act independently. We explore the effect of varying the level of price competition on the profitts of the industry participants and demonstrate the important role played by the spread of underlying market shares. The coefficient of variation of these market shares determines whether decentralised supply chains can outperform integrated supply chains with an appropriate level of competition.  The second and third papers focus on in-chain horizontal competition with capacity constraints. In the second paper, we look at a supply chain with one manufacturer and two downstream retailers. Based on total capacity available, the manufacturer needs to find ways to best use the capacity by determining whether or not to release the capacity information to retailers.  The third paper looks at competition in a more complicated supply chain structure. A retailer buys three brands of products from two manufacturers. One manufacturer produces both branded and private label products, and the other one manufactures a branded product only. With our model, we are able to determine the profits of each supply chain agent. At the end of the paper, we use data from the Australian milk industry and discuss a problem in which a manufacturer needs to decide how to allocate capacity between the national brand and the private label when there is a capacity shortage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horizontial competition</field><field name="subject">Supply chain management</field><field name="subject">Capacity competition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43537</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunological and virological correlates of persistent illness following primary Epstein-Barr virus infection</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Barbara, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in childhood is typically asymptomatic, but infection later in life results in a mononucleosis with the illness severity ranging from asymptomatic to requiring hospitalisation. The illness is generally short-lived (four to six weeks following onset of symptoms), but persistent disabling symptoms (lasting up to 6 months or longer) are well described in around ten percent of individuals. The aim of this work was to characterise immunological and virological parameters in the peripheral blood, which correlate with persistence of symptoms following EBV-induced mononucleosis. Subjects were recruited prospectively following confirmed primary EBV infection, to allow blood samples and clinical data to be collected at multiple timepoints (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months and at least 12 months later). Subjects with 6 months or more of disabling symptoms were defined as ???cases??? with control subjects being those whose illness resolved within 6 weeks of enrolment. Cases were compared with control subjects in terms of: cellular EBV viral load in the peripheral blood by PCR; development of antibodies against EBV VCA (IgG and IgM) and EBNA-1 (IgG) by ELISA; proportions of peripheral blood leucocyte subsets and their activation status by flow cytometry; the magnitude, kinetics of development, and breadth of the CD8+ cytotoxic cell response by interferon-?? Elispot; cytokine levels in serum, and production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo; and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by microarray. With the exception of gene expression, none of these parameters correlated with early resolution of symptoms or predicted clinical outcome following primary EBV infection. Antibody patterns suggest a tendency to Th2 type immune response may be associated with persistent illness. Preliminary analysis of the gene expression studies indicates that there are many genes involved in this complex disease requiring further investigation. Persistent illness following EBV infection is not associated with uncontrolled viral  replication, or chronic immune activation due to an aberrant primary immune response.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epstein-Barr virus</field><field name="subject">Epstein-Barr virus diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22373</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the design of implementation of turbo-coded Hybrid-ARQ</field><field name="creator">Oteng-Amoako, Kingsley, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem of the efficient use of Hybrid Automatic-Repeat-reQuest (Hybrid-ARQ) in wireless communication has attracted a considerable amount of research. In this thesis, the use and implementation of turbo codes as the Forward Error Correction (FEC) code for Hybrid-ARQ is investigated. The major accomplishments of the research include both the analysis and implementation of turbo Hybrid-ARQ. The thesis begins by obtaining a tractable bound for the performance of turbo codes with M-ary Quadrature-Amplitude-Modulation (M-ary QAM). The research considers the design problem of turbo coded Hybrid-ARQ optimized for AWGN and fading channels. The design problem of turbo Hybrid-ARQ in wideband channels is considered and an optimization strategy is proposed based on Orthogonal-Frequency-Division- Multiplexing (OFDM). The research also presents a novel rate scalable encoder structure that optimal selects a disparate but optimal pair of component codes given the channel conditions. A second part of the thesis considers the implementation of turbo Hybrid-ARQ in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI ) systems. A design for a single architecture for Type-I and Type-II turbo Hybrid-ARQ is suggested in addition to approaches for improving performance of the Soft-Output-Viterbi-Algorithm(SOVA) decoder core. The research also proposes a SOVA decoder architecture that exploits reliability information to select between the SOVA and bi-directional SOVA.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Turbo Codes</field><field name="subject">Hybrid-ARQ</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developmental orthopaedic disease in Thoroughbred foals: an epidemiological comparison between a stud in Ireland and a stud in Australia</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Michelle</field><field name="description">Master of Science in Veterinary Science</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developmental Orthopaedic Disease</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Thoroughbreds</field><field name="subject">comparison</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5004</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion and sustainability of information and communications technologies in community-based non-profit organisations: an exploratory study of Victoria and Tuscany</field><field name="creator">Denison, Thomas Frank</field><field name="description">Worldwide, governments and representatives of the community sector believe that the adoption of ICT by community-sector organisations is important because it contributes to the achievement of mission, strategic and business objectives, and benefits the communities those organisations serve. However, despite the fact that many organisations have developed innovative ICT applications, most experience problems in taking up ICT (Burt &amp; Taylor 1999, Surman 2001, DCITA 2005b). This thesis explores the conditions for success and barriers to the take-up and effective use of information and communications technology (ICT), specifically websites and online services, by community-based non-profit organisations, using a study of seventeen organisations based in rural and regional Victoria in Australia, and Tuscany in Italy. In particular, it examines the structural barriers and the inter-organisational relationships that act to facilitate the take-up, or otherwise, of technology by community sector non-profit organisations.    The study adopts a grounded theory approach, based on a two-stage data analysis: using the LIAISE framework for the take-up of ICT (Schauder et al. 2005), to identify the factors or conditions that contribute to the development of effective, sustainable websites; and social network analysis to explore the extent to which organisational networks enable the achievement of those conditions. The broad aims of this approach are to enable the evaluation of the existing LIAISE framework and to develop it as a more dynamic systems model capable of serving as a guide to policy and action. The study finds that although the LIAISE framework provides a good taxonomy of the factors important to the take-up of ICT by community-based non-profit organisations, it has weaknesses in that it does not explicitly identify user literacy as a factor, nor does it sufficiently emphasise the importance of an organisation&#8217;s external relationships, which provide an essential means of accessing required information and resources such as technical skills, and of enhancing core internal skills such as the ability to develop strategic plans. A new model is proposed to address these weaknesses: ALLIANCE (Applications; Literacy; user Literacy; Infrastructure; Access; Networks; Computing support; and Evaluation).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ALLIANCE model</field><field name="subject">Information and communications technologies (ICT)</field><field name="subject">Tuscany</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/72047</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recombinant protein production utilising a metallothionein expression system and a Super-CHO cell line</field><field name="creator">Huang, Edwin P.C., Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A novel metal-inducible and amplifiable metallothionein (MT) expression system, pNK, was firstly optimised and characterised for the production of a reporter protein, human growth hormone (hGH) in a suspension CHO cell line grown in a serum-free media. The pNK-based hGH production was demonstrated in cadmium-free condition under various fermentation modes (batch, fed-batch and perfusion) and scales (flask to bench-top bioreactor). Improvement of specific productivity of recombinant protein from pNK was shown to be possible by addition of butyrate or substrate substitution of glutamine by glutamate. Combination of fed-batch and butyrate addition strategies resulted in more than one gram per litre of hGH being obtained from the pNK expression system in a bioreactor. In the second part of the project, based on a statistical approach suggested by Plackett-Burman (P-B), a chemically-defined and protein-free medium, named Super-CHO protein-free (SPF), was developed to support a Super-CHO cell line, C2.8-325, to grow as a single-cell suspension culture with comparable growth rate and viable cell number as observed in a commercial medium containing undefined additives. Using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium/Ham's F12 1:1 mixture (DMEM/F12) as the basal medium, a P-B design matrix screened 10 nutritional components. Components shown potentially beneficial for cell growth rate and viable cell number were supplemented to DMEM/F12 to formulate the SPF medium. Finally, the pNK expression system and the Super-CHO cell line were applied simultaneously in an attempt to express a humanised anti-CD48 monoclonal antibody (MAb), IgG1-N2A (N2A-MAb). This aimed to test C2.8-SPF grown in newly developed SPF medium for transfection, clone development and recombinant protein production. A stable and N2A-MAb expressing C2.8-SPF cell line was successfully constructed, and N2A MAb expression was subsequently amplified and demonstrated in various cultivation scales (flask and bioreactor).

Some breeds carry genetic diseases which affect the health of the animals, but may also serve as a valuable model to identify genes involved in human disease. In the Border Collie breed in Australia, the identification of two disease genes would enable breeders to DNA test their animals and prevent future cases. Over 530 samples were collected to identify the genes responsible for these diseases through linkage mapping and candidate gene approaches.  Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) defines a group of symptoms that cause the incorrect development of different regions within the eye, and may also result in the detachment of the retina. The presence of the disease in different breeds of collies suggests that the disease originated before the differentiation of the collie breeds. The CEA gene was mapped to a region of CFA37, but the disease gene was identified by another research group.  Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that affects Border Collie dogs from approximately 16 months of age. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and affected animals display a range of physiological and behavioural symptoms that include loss of muscular control, nervousness and sometimes aggression. Due to the debilitating nature of the disease, dogs rarely survive beyond 28 months of age.  Microsatellite markers were used to exclude the Border Collie NCL gene from the region of the English Setter NCL gene (homolog of human NCL gene CLN8). Further work mapped the disease gene to CFA22, in a region containing the homolog for CLN5, one of the identified human disease genes for NCL. Subsequent sequencing of canine CLN5 revealed a nonsense mutation (c.619C&gt;T, Q206X) that co-segregated with NCL in Border Collie pedigrees. This truncation mutation resulted in a protein product of similar size to some mutations identified in human CLN5 and therefore the Border Collie may make a good model for future NCL studies. With DNA testing now available, breeders of Border Collies can now ensure that no animal will die of NCL.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Veterinary genetics</field><field name="subject">Dogs</field><field name="subject">Gene Mapping</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Genetic disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25511</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integration of map and B-SCP in order to manage evolution of strategic it requirements</field><field name="creator">Babar, Abdul Razzaq, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The scope of requirements engineering must include high-level business objectives and strategies to achieve traceability between IT and business needs in order to ensure alignment.  B-SCP handles this issue effectively. However, we must also deal with the evolution of business strategy operationlised in business processes and supporting it. MAP, goal/strategy modelling technique handles such evolution effectively. Integration of MAP with B-SCP can help us to address deficiency of addressing requirements evolution in the B-SCP framework.  This thesis presents the first steps in a research project that integrates the requirements engineering methodologies, B-SCP and MAP, in order to manage evolution of strategic IT. Semantic similarities between B-SCP and MAP motivate us to combine both techniques. The integration theory results in three alternative mechanisms through which we can connect MAP with B-SCP. The usefulness of the three mechanisms is tested on two exemplars -- small one and detailed one. These mechanisms have advantages and disadvantages depending upon the complexity of the business system. MAP has a Gap Analysis process inbuilt so this saves on the overhead of inventing a new approach. In addition, MAP also extends B-SCP's capability by the addition of non-deterministic process modelling which allows B-SCP framework to offer multiple views of requirements. During the integration process, we encountered a number of issues. One important was that B-SCP identifies goals as a snapshot in time which are aligned hierarchically from higher level model to lower level model, however MAP identifies processes that strive to achieve goals and do not provide alignment between different levels of MAPs. This was a challenging issue to deal with during the integration.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information technology -- Management.</field><field name="subject">Systems engineering.</field><field name="subject">Electronic commerce.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40680</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated metal spinning: visual tracking and force control methodologies.</field><field name="creator">Hanafi, Daniel, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis presents the development of force controller to maintain desired normal forces during a very stiff contact operation conducted in a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. Force controller approach described in this thesis requires the accurate knowledge of the nominal tool path a priori. Obtaining the nominal tool path accurately is carried out by a vision based profile tracking system presented in this thesis. Both the force control and visual profile tracking systems require the development of an active control system to respond to force and vision signals.  To facilitate the active control, a two-stage approach has been taken. The first stage is to bring the CNC machine under real-time control of an external computer. The second stage is the design of the active axis controller. This is achieved by adding sensor feedback loops to the external axis controller.  The purpose of the active vision based profile tracking system is to automatically generate the tool path accurately. Emphasis is on combining low resolution vision with visual control of the precision CNC machine to attain the accuracy required for metal spinning. Combination of visual profile tracking and an edge detection method that gives sub-pixel accuracy were used to obtain the required tool path. A curvature detection algorithm was developed to identify segments of the tool path by assuming that the tool path consists of circular and straight line segments.  The developed active force controller operates in a dynamic setup and is used to maintain tool forces at desired levels. The complete control system operates in a manner similar to reaction compensation and the force controller can be viewed as an integrating on-off controller with minimum integral wind-up effect. As a result, a direct dependency of the control efforts on error signals has been eliminated. In addition, the force controller brings in artificial damping that ensures the stability of the control system.

Conceptually, ingroup bias can be comprised of ingroup positivity, outgroup negativity, or both. However, research has often confounded these components on the assumption that they are reciprocally related. The aim of this research project was to examine the relative dominance of ingroup positivity versus outgroup negativity in ingroup bias and the relationship between them. Two approaches were employed. First, a series of laboratory studies examined the effect of threat on implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes. In Study 1, ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity were assessed in the domains of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination in a context where threat appeared to be salient. Analyses within and across measures revealed that ingroup positivity was more dominant than outgroup negativity, and that ingroup and outgroup attitudes were unrelated or positively related. Experiments that manipulated the salience of realistic threat (Studies 2 and 3), symbolic threat, (Studies 6 and 7), or both (Studies 4 and 5) similarly produced nonsignificant or positive correlations between ingroup and outgroup attitudes. However, in Studies 4, 5, and 7, perceptions of symbolic threat significantly influenced intergroup attitudes. Overall, the findings of the laboratory studies suggest that although threat can shift outgroup attitudes, it does not necessarily lead to reciprocity between ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity. The second approach employed in this dissertation involved content analysis of messages posted on an Internet hate site. In contrast to the laboratory experiments, Studies 8 and 9 found that ingroup positivity significantly predicted outgroup negativity. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the possibility that ingroup positivity will be linked to outgroup hostility when people are highly identified with their ingroup and when the outgroup defines the ingroup. This dissertation contributes to the intergroup relations literature by providing a more detailed account of implicit and explicit ingroup bias, and by identifying potential conditions leading to a negative relationship between ingroup and outgroup attitudes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small groups</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22916</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstraction and representation of fields and their applications in biomedical modelling</field><field name="creator">Tsafnat, Guy, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Computer models are used extensively to investigate biological systems. Many of these systems can be described in terms of fields???spatially- and temporally- varying scalar, vector and tensor properties defined over domains. For example, the spatial variation of muscle fibers is a vector field, the spatial and temporal variation in temperature of an organ is a scalar field, and the distribution of stress across muscle tissue is a tensor field. In this thesis I present my research on how to represent fields in a format that allows researchers to store and distribute them independently of models and to investigate and manipulate them intuitively. I also demonstrate how the work can be applied to solving and analysing biomedical models. To represent fields I created a two-layer system. One layer, called the Field Representation Language (FRL), represents fields by storing numeric, analytic and meta data for storage and distribution. The focus of this layer is efficiency rather than usability. The second layer, called the Abstract Field Layer (AFL), provides an abstraction of fields so that they are easier for researchers to work with. This layer also provides common operations for manipulating fields as well as transparent conversion to and from FRL representations. The applications that I used to demonstrate the use of AFL and FRL are (a) a fields visualisation toolkit, (b) integration of models from different scales and solvers, and (c) a solver that uses AFL internally. The layered architecture facilitated the development of tools that use fields. A similar architecture may also prove useful for representations of other modelled entities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological models</field><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Computer graphics</field><field name="subject">Biological systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24207</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual human-machine interfaces and intelligent navigation of wheelchairs</field><field name="creator">Kang, Seong Pal, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the development of virtual Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) and navigation method for wheelchair systems.  For virtual HMI, hand gesture recognition is employed, and two different hand gesture recognition algorithms have been developed. One is based on the geometric properties of a hand shape, and the other algorithm is based on the curvature of a hand shape contour.  In the hand gesture recognition algorithm using geometric properties of a hand shape, eight non-dimensional parameters are computed and identifies hand shapes by comparing the ranges of the parameters to the statistical range information. This algorithm is invariant at scale, but does not work properly if the forearm of a hand shape is cluttered.  The curvature based hand gesture recognition algorithm recognizes hand gestures using a combination of hand shape contour geometry and a non-dimensional quantity derived using the curvatures of the hand shape contour. The algorithm produces a set of signatures of the contour and identifies each hand gesture by finding matched template signatures. This algorithm is not affected by the forearm of a hand shape, but the scaling procedure is required. The developed gesture recognition system is implemented on a wheelchair in two different modes of operations, namely, the manual mode and the map (autonomous) mode. In the manual mode, the user continuously interacts with the wheelchair and controls the speed and the steering using the position and the orientation of hand gestures. In the map mode, the user selects a desired destination by pointing with a hand gesture onto a known map, and then the wheelchair initiates autonomous navigation.  For wheelchair navigation, a doorway recognition algorithm and an obstacle avoidance algorithm have been developed. The wheelchair is localised by finding the doorway template in the specified zone. If the doorway recognition algorithm does not detect the doorway, it navigates to find the doorway using the obstacle avoidance algorithm. The obstacle avoidance algorithm finds obstacle edge points using range data and decides a safe passage for wheelchair navigation to find the doorway.  Results obtained by implementing the above mentioned algorithms are presented.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human-machine systems</field><field name="subject">Wheelchairs</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24359</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study Of Porcelain As A Restorative Dental Material</field><field name="creator">Southan, David E</field><field name="description">Doctor of Dental Science</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental ceramics</field><field name="subject">Dentistry, Operative</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4810</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The physical properties of modern dental porcelain</field><field name="creator">Southan, David E</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental porcelain</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4889</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical review of literature concerning some aspects of bone and some of its diseases namely, hypo- and hyperthyroidism, Paget's disease, Hand-Schuller-Christian and Letterer-Siwe diseases and eosinophilic granuloma (histiocytosis X)</field><field name="creator">Southan, David E</field><field name="description">Master of Dental Surgery</field><field name="date">1959</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/4876</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The immediately loaded single implant retained mandibular overdenture : a 3 year prospective study</field><field name="creator">Liddelow, Glen J</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether simplifying mandibular overdenture treatment utilising single stage surgery and immediate prosthetic loading of a single implant, will achieve similar implant success rates and functional improvement to that expected using conventional techniques. As part of this study, the Mk III Br&#229;nemark implant with an oxidised surface (TiUnite&#153; Nobel Biocare AB, G&#246;teborg, Sweden) was compared to the classical machined Mk III Br&#229;nemark fixture.Materials and Methods: 35 patients with a mean age of 68 years and problematic mandibular dentures were treated. The primary complaints among the patients referred to the clinic for treatment related to poor retention of the mandibular denture, instability, denture sores and phonetic problems. Patients were initially placed randomly into the &#147;machined surface&#148; or &#147;oxidised surface&#148; group. A single implant was placed into the mandibular midline with high initial stability. A ball attachment was placed and the retentive cap incorporated into the existing denture. Reviews took place at 3,12 6 6 and 36 months. Clinical assessments, radiographs made with custom film holders, and stability measurements by both manual and resonance frequency analysis methods were recorded. All complications, failures, maintenance and reasons for dropout were noted. Visual analogue scale questionnaires were utilised to record patient satisfaction. (ANOVA p&lt;.05) Results: Three out of 8 machined surface implants failed, representing an unacceptably high failure rate (37.5%). The machined surface was therefore discontinued for this study. Three oxidised surface implants did not achieve sufficient primary stability to be immediately loaded, so were treated with a two stage delayed loading protocol. The 25 immediately loaded oxidised surface implants were all classified as surviving at the 36-month recall. Patient satisfaction was very high with a significant increase in all comfort and functional parameters. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study and research design, it appears that the immediately loaded single implant retained mandibular overdenture, using an oxidised implant surface in a small group of maladaptive patients, can provide a beneficial treatment outcome over a three year observation period. If insufficient stability at insertion is not achieved for immediate loading, then a delayed loading protocol should be utilised.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental implants -- Complications</field><field name="subject">Overlay dentures</field><field name="subject">Immediate loading</field><field name="subject">Implant overdenture</field><field name="subject">Edentulous mandible</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0072</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that influence the estimation of three-dimensional gleno-humeral joint repositioning error in asymptomatic healthy subjects</field><field name="creator">Monie, Aubrey</field><field name="description">Joint Position Sense (JPS) of the shoulder as determined by repeated repositioning tasks has been performed under different constrained testing conditions. The variability in the testing protocols for JPS testing of the gleno-humeral joint may incorporate different movement patterns, numbers of trials used to derived a specific JPS variable and range of motion. All of these aspects may play an important role in the assessment of G-H JPS testing. When using a new instrument for assessing JPS all of these issues need to be examined to document the optimal testing protocols for subsequent clinical assessments. By undertaking these studies future clinical trials may be more optimally assessed to determine if there are differences between dominant and non-dominant arms as well as the presence of JPS changes in performance associated with pathology and rehabilitation. This study used a 3-dimensional tracking system to examined gleno-humeral JPS using 2 open kinetic chain movement patterns. The 'conventional' 90 degree abducted, externally rotated movement was compared to the hypothetically more functional D2 movement pattern used in proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitatory techniques. These two patterns were tested at different ranges (low and high). Two cohorts (n=12, n=16) of normal healthy athletic males aged 17-35 years, performed matching tasks of both left and right arms. The second cohort (n=16) were assessed with and without strapping the gleno-humeral joint with sports tape. Accuracy (overall bias) and precision (variability) scores were determined for progressively greater numbers of trials. The findings of the study show that estimates of JPS accuracy and precision become more stable from data derived from 5 to 6 matching trials. There were no statistical differences between sides [95%CI  &#177; 1.5cm]. The accuracy but not precision improved as subjects approximated the 'high' end of range in the 'conventional' or D2 pattern. Furthermore, no systematic differences were detected at different ranges of movement or movement patterns with or without the application of sports tape. These findings provide a guide to the number of trials that optimise the testing of the gleno-humeral joint and also suggest that in normal controls the magnitude of differences between sides and movement patterns is similar. These findings also iii indicate that sports tape applied to the shoulder may not significantly change the JPS performance in healthy, athletic males.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proprioception</field><field name="subject">Shoulder joint -- Range of motion -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Shoulder instability</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0073</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Playas of the Yarra Yarra drainage system, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Boggs, Dimity</field><field name="description">This thesis examines playas as integrated ecosystems, through investigation of long- and short-term processes associated with playa geomorphology, hydrology and diatom ecology, in playas of the Yarra Yarra drainage system of Western Australia. This landscape approach was conducted at a range of scales and consequently revealed a level of heterogeneity not previously described in Australian playas. The key result and common thread linking the three facets of the playas investigated is the importance of hydroperiod in defining the playa environment. The morphology and distribution of playas are described and the results presented of an examination of potential mechanisms determining intra-system variability. Measurements of the physical attributes of the playas, including length, area, shape, density and orientation, were made through Geographic Information System analysis and detailed interpretation of aerial photography. Two main morphological groups are distinguished: small (&lt;10 ha), elliptical to circular playas with a NNW-SSE orientation; and large (&gt;30 ha), elongated playas. Regional patterns in geomorphic attributes are markedly different between the west and east sides of the system. The boundary between the two regions coincides approximately with rainfall distribution. In this respect, climate is an overarching driver of geomorphological variation but sub-catchment characteristics are also critical determinants. Littoral drift and segmentation processes that are common to coastal lagoons but not commonly described in playas were identified from visual interpretation of aerial photographs of spits, bars and cuspate shorelines. Six small playas, representing an hydrological continuum from mostly wet to mostly dry, were selected for investigation of their hydrology and diatom ecology, enabling assessment ii of the variability of hydrology, hydrochemistry and of the effects of different hydrological environments on the distribution of taxa. Hydroperiod was highly variable and central to determining playa geomorphology and biology. In the six playas it ranged from 19 to over 211 days, and filling frequency from 1 to 3 cycles between 2002 and 2004, reflecting rainfall and sub-catchment variability. Monitoring a series of nested piezometers revealed that the playas were net discharge points for ground water over the period of survey. However, small local vertical head variations indicate ground water does not discharge at the same rate across the playa surfaces and that playas may have short-lived phases of ground water recharge. Hydrochemically, the playas are typical of salt lakes in Australia. They displayed a wide range of salinity values, neutral to alkaline pH and ionic composition similar to sea water. It is postulated that the geochemical evolution of waters in the playas follows a pathway where low salinity recharge waters with dilute sea water salts progress to Na-Cl dominated brines through evaporative concentration. Surface waters showed an ionic dominance consistent with sea water with minor variations attributed to transitional phases in the geochemical evolution of the waters. Shallow ground waters showed a common and consistent pattern of ionic dominance: Na+ &gt;Mg2+ &gt;K+ &gt;Ca2+ : Cl- &gt;SO4 2- &gt;HCO3 -&gt;CO3 2-.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Hydrology</field><field name="subject">Playas -- Western Australia -- Yarra Yarra Catchment</field><field name="subject">Salt lakes -- Western Australia -- Yarra Yarra Catchment</field><field name="subject">Yarra Yarra Catchment (W.A.)</field><field name="subject">Salt lakes</field><field name="subject">Geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Diatoms</field><field name="subject">Playas</field><field name="subject">Landscape ecology</field><field name="subject">Limnology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0074</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loosening the shackles of the truth defence on free speech : making the truth defence in Australian defamation law more user friendly for media defendants</field><field name="creator">Fernandez, Joseph M</field><field name="description">Defamation law&#145;s truth defence &#150; the oldest, most obvious and principal defence &#150; has failed Australian media defendants. Few who mount the defence succeed. Many, discouraged by the defence&#145;s onerousness, do not even attempt it. As a consequence the journalistic articulation of matters of public concern is stifled. This thesis argues that the limitations of the Australian truth defence are inconsistent with established freedom of speech ideals and the public interest in having a robust media. As a result society is constrained from enlightened participation in public affairs. This thesis proposes reforms to alleviate the heavy demands of the defence so as to promote the publication of matters of public concern and to strike a more contemporary balance between freedom of speech and the protection of reputation. These reforms employ defamation law&#145;s doctrinal calculus to reposition the speech-reputation fulcrum. While defamation law has for decades attracted reform attention, the truth defence has languished by the wayside. This thesis steps into the breech. The cornerstone of this thesis is a proposal to reverse the burden so that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving falsity of the defamatory publication where: the complainant is a public figure; the matter complained about is a matter of public concern; and the suit involves a media defendant. While this proposal is likely to dramatically alter the prevailing Australian freedom of speech/protection of reputation equilibrium, other measures are proposed to serve as a bulwark against the wanton destruction of reputation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freedom of the press -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Libel and slander -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Mass media -- Law and legislation -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Defamation</field><field name="subject">Truth defence in defamation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0075</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient supply and habitat specificity of the rare mycoheterotrophic underground orchid, Rhizanthella gardneri</field><field name="creator">Bougoure, Jeremy J.</field><field name="description">Rhizanthella gardneri (Rogers) is a critically endangered orchid restricted to two isolated regions of south-western Australia. Rhizanthella gardneri is an entirely subterranean mycoheterotrophic species that purportedly forms a tripartite relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus (Ceratobasidiales) that links with an autotrophic shrub of the Melaleuca uncinata complex to acquire nutrients. Whether the rarity of R. gardneri is intrinsic is overshadowed by the recent effect of extrinsic factors that means R. gardneri requires some form of conservation and may also be a viable candidate for restoration. To create an integrated conservation strategy for R. gardneri, reasons for its decline and knowledge of its biological and ecological functioning must be elucidated. This thesis focuses on three key questions; 1) what are the habitat requirements and limitations to R. gardneri survival; 2) what is the identity and specificity of the fungus R. gardneri forms mycorrhizas with; and 3) does R. gardneri form a nutrient-sharing tripartite relationship with a mycorrhizal fungus and autotrophic shrub. Key climate, soil and vegetation characteristics of known R. gardneri habitats were quantified to provide baseline data for monitoring known R. gardneri populations, to better understand how R. gardneri interacts with its habitat, and to identify possible new sites for R. gardneri introduction. Habitats of the two known R. gardneri populations differed considerably in soil chemistry, Melaleuca structure and Melaleuca productivity. Individual sites within populations were relatively similar in all attributes measured while overall Northern and Southern habitats were distinct from each other. These results suggest that R. gardneri can tolerate a range of conditions and may be more widespread than previously thought, given that there are extensive areas of Melaleuca thickets with similar habitat characteristics across south-western Australia. The fungus forming mycorrhizas with R. gardneri was identified, using nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, as a Rhizoctonia-type fungus within the Ceratobasidiales. All fungi isolated from R. gardneri individuals representative of its currently known distribution were genetically similar, suggesting R. gardneri is highly dependent on this specific fungal species. Given that R. gardneri appears to exclusively associate with a specific fungal species, species-specific molecular primers were designed and used to analyse the fungi&#146;s presence in known and potential R. gardneri habitats. These results 6 suggest that the fungus exists beyond the known R. gardneri habitats and gives hope to finding new populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri -- Conservation -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri -- Nutrition -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Mycorrhizal fungi -- Conservation -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Melaleuca -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Rhizanthella gardneri</field><field name="subject">Underground orchid</field><field name="subject">Orchid mycorrhiza</field><field name="subject">Plant conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0076</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study to determine the quality of life and experiences for liver and kidney transplant recipients and living kidney donors in Western Australia : the economic implications</field><field name="creator">O'Driscoll, Catherine T.</field><field name="description">The use of quality-of-life as an outcome measure provides detailed information about the effectiveness of medical treatments than morbidity or mortality rates alone. The use of quality-of-life data in the clinical setting can inform patients regarding treatment options, treatment benefits and costs. In competing health care markets, outcome measurement is regarded as important as it is concerned with the impact of health care practice and affects health policy decisions. Doessel (1978) conducted the first Australian study on the cost-effectiveness analysis of renal replacement therapies. The study was based on Klarman, Francis &amp; Rosenthal's (1968) the study, where the output was measured in terms of the number of life years gained from kidney transplantation, and a twenty-five percent weight was allocated in an attempt to capture quality-of-life from kidney transplantation. Doessel (1978) used two sources of data: Australian data (Disney 1974) and European data (Gurland et al. 1973; Shiel et al. 1974). The study measured life years gained, and agreed with the Klarman et al. (1974) findings that transplantation is the most effective way to increase life expectancy of persons with chronic renal disease (Butler &amp; Doessel 1989). The outputs of the alternative treatments were not reported in monetary terms; the study focused on life years gained as the output measure. Hence the importance of this current study, which includes a cost-effectiveness analysis for cadaver liver, and living kidney transplantation for end-stage liver and kidney disease patients. Calls to respect patient autonomy and to produce patient-centered outcomes have recently brought the patient&#146;s point of view back into the center of clinical medicine (Sullivan 2003). Survival rates indicate one measure of outcome however they do not reflect patients&#146; perceptions of health benefit or experiences. Noting that patients&#146; psychosocial effect on functioning is of more concern to them than their physical Thesis Preamble iii ability, that more accurate knowledge of patients&#146; conditions be measured prior to transplantation (Tarter et al. 1991). Recently researchers advocated investigating transplant patients' states of health to assess the social benefit of these expensive health care services from their perspective (Joralemon &amp; Fujinaga 1997). The current study's mixed method, bridges the gaps in treatment outcome measurements, as the mixed method applied (Creswell 1994; Sim &amp; Sharp 1998) prospectively measured quality-oflife, determined health utility, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

However, today&#146;s memory technology is incapable of meeting the speed requirements. Combined input and output queued (CIOQ) switches have emerged as one alternative to address the problem of memory speed. When a switch of this architecture uses a stable matching algorithm to transfer packets across the switch fabric, an output queued (OQ) switch can be mimicked exactly with a speedup of only two. The use of a stable matching algorithm typically requires complex and time-consuming calculations to ensure the behaviour of an OQ switch is maintained. Stable matching algorithms are well studied in the area in which they originally appeared. However, little is presently known on how the stable matching algorithm performs in CIOQ switches and how key parameters are affected by switch size, traffic type and traffic load. Knowledge of how these conditions affect performance is essential to judge the practicability of an architecture and to provide useful information on how to design such switches. Until now, CIOQ switches were likely to be dismissed due to the high complexity of the stable matching algorithm when applied to other applications. However, the characteristics of a stable matching algorithm in a CIOQ switch have not been thoroughly analysed. The principal goal of this thesis is to identify the conditions the stable matching algorithm encounters in a CIOQ switch under realistic operational scenarios. This thesis provides accurate mathematical models based on Markov chains to predict the value of key parameters that affect the complexity and runtime of a stable matching algorithm in CIOQ switches. The applicability of the models is then backed up by simulations. The results of the analysis quantify critical operational parameters, such as the size and number of preference lists and runtime complexity. These provide detailed insights into switch behaviour and useful information for switch designs. Major conclusions to be drawn from this analysis include that the average values of the key parameters of the stable matching algorithm are feasibly small and do not strongly correlate with switch size, which is contrary to the behaviour of the stable matching ii algorithm in its original application. Furthermore, although these parameters have wide theoretical ranges, the mean values and standard deviations are found to be small under operational conditions. The results also suggest that the implementation becomes very versatile as the completion time of the stable matching algorithm is not strongly correlated to the network traffic type; that is, the runtime is minimally affected by the nature of the traffic.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">Matching theory</field><field name="subject">Switching theory</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication -- Switching systems</field><field name="subject">Data networks</field><field name="subject">Stable matching</field><field name="subject">Markov chain</field><field name="subject">Switching algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0078</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE IMPACT OF THE SCALE OF MAPPING ON
SOIL MAP QUALITY</field><field name="creator">Eldridge, Simon Michael</field><field name="description">It is generally assumed that increased map precision (ie map unit homogeneity) and map
purity (map unit accuracy) should result from increasing the scale of mapping of the soil
resource, since it should enable a more intricate breakdown of the landscape into
landform facet based units. This study compared the predictive success of a 1:10K scale
soil association map with the 1:25K and 1:lOOK scale soil landscape maps within the
Birrigai area of the Paddy's river catchment, south west of Canberra, A.C.T. The 1:25K
and the 1:lOOK scale soil landscape maps were also evaluated in a second larger
evaluation area in the Paddy's river catchment which allowed more of the larger soil
landscape map units to be evaluated. The 1:25K scale soil map was produced by
another author for the A.C.T Government, and was surveyed at a substantially lower
survey intensity than that for the 1:lOOK and 1:10K scale soil maps (ie only 0.05
observation sites / cm2 of published map). These maps were evaluated using a set of
randomly located independent evaluation sites in each evaluation area, and from these
calculating and comparing standard Marsman &amp; de Gruijter(1986) measures of Map
Purity.
The strength of soil-landscape relationships within this catchment were determined from
a Fixed One Way Analysis of Variance, and from more simplistic graphical
comparisons of the means and standard deviations of the discrete soil data within these
landform based map units. Soil-landscape relationships for the Nominal scale soil data
(ie class type data) were evaluated by comparing the Marsman &amp; de Gruijter(1986)
Homogeneity index ratings among the soil map units. Intensive survey traverses were
also carried out in selected soil landscapes to further evaluate the strength of soil
landscapes present.
The results revealed obvious improvements in map quality associated with increasing
map scale from 1:100,000 to 1:10,000, and these included increases in the predictive
success (Map Purity), reductions in the extent of map unit impurities, and planning
advantages associated with having individual land facets delineated on the 1:10,000
scale map. The respectable purity ratings achieved by the 1:100,000 scale soil
landscape map (ie average purity rating of 63%) was largely attributed to the flexibility
of the "soil material" approach to soil landscape mapping. The relatively poor
performance of the 1:25K consultancy soil landscape map demonstrated the fact that;
any benefit gained from the improved intricacy in the representation of map unit
delineation's with increased mapping scale, will be drastically reduced if it is not
matched by an associated increase in the intensity of field investigations.
Evaluations of the soil-landscape relationships found that the land facets of the Paddy's
river catchment generally failed to delineate areas that were both uniform and unique in
respect of their soil properties. Soil-landscape relationships were instead found to be
quite complex, applying to only certain land facets, and in regards to only certain soil
properties. Soil maps with units based on landsurface features were recommended on
the basis of the importance of other landscape factors other than soils to land capability
ratings, as well as on the useability of such maps. This study recommended the
adoption of a" &gt;2 detailed soil profile observations / land facet in each map unit"
mapping standard to ensure a reasonable estimate of the variability and modal soil
conditions present, as well as a reliable confirmation of the perceived soil-landscape
relationships. The error usually associated with small scale mapping was effectively
reduced by rapid ground truthing, involving driving along the major roads dissecting the
map area and making brief observations of soil exposures on road batters, despite the
bias of the road network making such mapping improvements uneven across the map.
The major point to come from this study was the re-emphasising of the point that soil
spatial variability has to be accepted as a "real landscape attribute" which needs to be
accurately described and communicated to land users, and must not be considered as
some sort of soil mapping failure. The fact that individual facets of the landscape
rarely coincide with unique pockets of uniform and unique soils and soil properties must
be considered simply an on the ground reality of nature, and not some mapping failure.
It was thought that since other landscape factors (eg hillslope gradient) most often
dominate the determination of land use suitability and capability, it is better to
effectively describe the range and modal state of the soil conditions within such facets,
then to attempt to extrapolate possible soil boundaries using geostatistical techniques
which cut across such land facets, and mayor may not correlate with real groupings of
soil properties, depending on the spatial resolution of the soil variability distribution in
the landscape. Even so the results of this investigation do put the validity of the
physiographic terrain class mapping model as a predictor of soil traits under question, at
least for the more complex landscape settings.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Birrigai area</field><field name="subject">Paddy's river catchment</field><field name="subject">Australian Capital Territory</field><field name="subject">map</field><field name="subject">soil landscape</field><field name="subject">map quality</field><field name="subject">map evaluation</field><field name="subject">map scale.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090611.142826</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RNAi-mediated knockdown of chromatin modifier proteins and their effect on long-term memory in Drosophila : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Genetics</field><field name="creator">Ellen, Charles</field><field name="description">Memory formation in Drosophila melanogaster is composed of two pathways that are genetically distinct, and functionally independent of each other. These are short-term and long-term memory. Short-term memory is a transient phenomenon, located in the cytoplasm of the neuronal cells, which requires no alteration of gene expression. The formation of long-term memory requires a change in gene expression, therefore chromatin-modifying complexes may play an integral part. The mushroom-bodies of Drosophila are a distinct bilateral brain structure and are essential for the formation and recollection of long-term memory. Therefore, an alteration in gene expression within the mushroom bodies is essential to the formation of long-term memory. Disruption of a gene within the mushroom-bodies that resulted in an alteration in the formation of long-term memory would indicate that the gene is involved in long-term memory. In order to investigate the role of the two chromatin-modifying proteins, HDACX and pr-Set7, whose role in memory function is unknown, RNA interference was used to knockdown expression of their respective mRNA. Published GAL4 lines were used to drive down expression in the mushroom bodies. The efficacy of the knockdown on levels of mRNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The effect of these knockdowns on the formation of long-term memory was assayed using conditioned courtship. Additionally, the actual spatial and temporal expression of the GAL4 drivers was investigated using fluorescent proteins, and analysed using fluorescent microscopy. Both pr-set7 and HDACX appear to play a role in long-term memory function. The RNAi-induced knockdown of the individual mRNAs caused impairment in long-term memory formation, although the exact mode of action is still to be elucidated. The levels of mRNA from these knockdowns were reduced within the head, although not to the extent expected. The fluorescent microscopy analysis indicated that the expression of mushroom-body specific GAL4 drivers was more widespread than previously reported.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetics</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Drosophila melanogaster</field><field name="subject">common fruit fly</field><field name="subject">long-term memory formation</field><field name="subject">chromatin-modifying complexes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/873</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of rice bran oil margarine with Flora margarine and Flora pro-activ margarine for lowering cholesterol : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Eady, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Phytosterols have been shown to be effective in reducing serum cholesterol levels in numerous human clinical studies and regular consumption is recommended as part of therapeutic lifestyle changes aimed at reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fat based spreads have been shown to be a very successful vehicle for delivery of plant sterols, readily accepted by consumers and efficacious in reducing cholesterol levels. Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread is a new product entering into the market place. It is derived from rice bran oil and contains high levels of unsaponifiable material rich in phytosterols, triterpene alcohols, ferulic acid esters ([gamma]-oryzanol) and vitamin E isomers. As such it may have the potential to lower serum cholesterol levels when consumed on a daily basis. In order to establish the effectiveness of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread compared with Flora pro-activ&#174; margarine, a well established brand of plant sterol margarine already proven to lower cholesterol, a randomised double blind cross-over human clinical trial over 12 weeks was conducted. The study was divided into two treatment arms. The first arm of the study was to determine whether Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread (containing 1.5% plant sterols) could lower total and LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than standard Flora margarine (containing no plant sterols) or Flora Pro-activ&#174; margarine (containing 8% plant sterols). The second study arm tested the proposition that daily consumption of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread in conjunction with rice bran oil (containing 0.5% plant sterols) would lower total and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in isolation and more than Flora margarine in conjunction with sunflower oil. Eighty mildly hypercholesterolaemic individuals (total cholesterol [greater than or equal to] 5 mmol/L and [less than or equal to] 7.5 mmol/L) were recruited and randomised into two groups of forty. Participants were asked to continue with their normal dietary pattern but to replace any margarine/butter/fat consumption with the trial products. One group of 40 were then assigned to the first treatment arm of the study (margarine-only group) and were randomised to consume 20 g (4 teaspoons) Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine daily for 4 weeks, or 20 Flora pro-activ&#174; daily for 4 weeks. Phytosterol levels delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma]-oryzanol; Flora proactiv&#174; 1600 mg phytosterol; Flora margarine 0mg phytosterol. The second group of 40 were allocated to the second arm of the trial (margarine and oil group) and consumed 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread and 30 ml rice bran oil (RBO) daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine and 30 ml sunflower oil daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, changing treatment at the end of each 4-week period. Phytosterol amounts delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118 mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma] oryzanol; RBO 222mg mg phytosterol, 150 mg [gamma] oryzanol. Each participant consumed all three treatments in a random order over a 12 week period. At baseline and following each 4 week intervention period, measurements were made of weight and blood pressure. Venous blood samples were collected for analysis of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol: HDL-C, triglycerides and plasma phytosterols. Three-day diet records from each individual were also collected for analysis of normal dietary intake. Results showed that compared to a standard Flora margarine, Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread significantly reduced total cholesterol by 2.2% (P=0.045), total cholesterol:HDL by 4.1% (P=0.005) and LDL-C by 3.5% (P=0.016), but was not as effective overall as Flora Pro-activ&#174; which reduced total cholesterol by 4.4% (P=0.001), total cholesterol:HDL by 3.4% (P=0.014) and LDL-C by 5.6% (P=0.001). Consumption of Flora margarine alone produced no significant decrease from baseline figures in any of the cholesterol parameters measured. Surprisingly, in group two, the addition of rice bran oil to the Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread produced no differences in cholesterol levels. The reason for this unexpected result is being explored further. These results confirm that Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread is effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels when consumed as part of a normal diet. Studies have shown that a 1% reduction in LDL-C can equate to a 2% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk thus suggesting that the 3.5% reduction demonstrated by Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in this study could be effective in reducing CHD risk as much as 6% in a mildly hypercholesterolaemic population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human nutrition</field><field name="subject">rice bran oil margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora pro-activ margarine</field><field name="subject">phytosterols</field><field name="subject">plant sterols</field><field name="subject">reduction of serum cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/875</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative studies on different enzyme preparations for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol production</field><field name="creator">Satianegara, Gernalia, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study is part of a project to develop a high productivity enzymatic process for (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC), a precursor for the pharmaceuticals ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, with recent interest for a low cost and more stable biocatalyst pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) preparation. PDC initially added in the form of Candida utilis cells, viz. whole cell PDC, showed higher stability towards substrate benzaldehyde and temperature in comparison to the partially purified preparation in an aqueous/benzaldehyde emulsion system. Increasing the temperature from 4?? to 21??C for PAC production with whole cell PDC resulted in similar final PAC levels of 39 and 43 g/L (258 and 289 mM) respectively from initial 300 mM benzaldehyde and 364 mM pyruvate. However, the overall volumetric productivity was enhanced by 2.8-fold. Enantiomeric excess values of 98 and 94% for R-PAC were obtained at 4?? and 21??C respectively and benzylalcohol (a potential by-product from benzaldehyde) was not formed. The potential of whole cell PDC was also evident in an aqueous/octanolbenzaldehyde emulsion system at 21??C with a 3-fold higher specific production compared to partially purified PDC. At 2.5 U/mL, PAC levels of 104 g/L in the organic phase and 16 g/L in the aqueous phase (60 g/L total reaction volume, 15 h) and a 99.1% enantiomeric excess for R-PAC were obtained with whole cell PDC. The study of cell membrane components provided a better understanding for the enhanced performance of whole cell PDC in comparison to partially purified PDC. It was apparent that surfactants, both biologically-occurring (e.g. phosphatidylcholine) and synthetically manufactured (e.g. bis(2-ethyl-1-hexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT)), enhanced PDC stability and/or PAC production in the aqueous/octanol-benzaldehyde biotransformation system with the partially purified enzyme. Addition of 50 mM AOT to the biotransformation with partially purified PDC enhanced the enzyme half-life by 13-fold (19 h) and increased specific PAC production by 2-fold (36 mg/U). Chemical modification studies targeting the amino and carboxyl groups were carried out to achieve increased stability of partially purified PDC. However these were not successful and future work could be directed at PDC protein engineering as well as optimization and scale up of the two-phase process using whole cell PDC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzymes</field><field name="subject">Cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25236</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Configuration encoding techniques for fast FPGA reconfiguration</field><field name="creator">Malik, Usama, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problem of reducing reconfiguration time of an island-style FPGA at its configuration memory level. The approach followed is to examine configuration encoding techniques in order to reduce the size of the bitstream that must  be loaded onto the device to perform a reconfiguration. A detailed analysis of a set of benchmark circuits on various island-style FPGAs shows that a typical circuit randomly changes a small number of bits in the {\it null} or default configuration state of the device. This feature is exploited by developing efficient encoding schemes for configuration data. For a wide set of benchmark circuits on various FPGAs, it is shown  that the proposed methods outperform all previous configuration compression methods and, depending upon the relative size of the circuit to the device, compress within 5\% of the fundamental information theoretic limit. Moreover, it is shown that the corresponding decoders are simple to implement in hardware and scale well with device size and available configuration bandwidth. It is not unreasonable to expect that with little modification to existing FPGA configuration memory systems and acceptable increase in configuration power a 10-fold improvement in configuration delay could be achieved. The main contribution of this thesis is that it defines the limit of configuration compression for the FPGAs under consideration and develops practical methods of overcoming this reconfiguration bottleneck. The functional density of reconfigurable devices could thereby be enhanced and the range of potential applications reasonably expanded.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Field programmable gate arrays</field><field name="subject">Programmable array logic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26212</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct torque controlled induction machines for integrated starter/alternator system</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jun, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An integrated starter/alternator (ISA) has been proposed for the future 42 V PowerNet, which combines both starter and alternator functions into a single electrical machine with bidirectional power flow ability. This thesis presents analysis, design, modeling and experimental results of the direct torque controlled ISA system based on a low voltage induction machine. The classical direct torque controlled ISA based on switching-table is systematically for an ISA evaluated in this thesis. The simulation and experimental results show that the direct torque control (DTC) concept can be successfully extended to the ISA application. An improved DTC of the ISA based on direct stator flux vector is presented to reduce the drawbacks of high torque and flux ripples of the classical DTC. Robust design of the controller ensures the system is not sensitive to the variation of rotor resistance. By controlling the electromagnetic torque of the induction machine quickly, the required dc bus voltage can be well regulated within the 42 V PowerNet specifications. Another improved DTC of the ISA with direct torque and flux control is also studied. Compared to the direct flux vector control scheme, the calculation of the commanded voltage vector in this scheme only requires the derivative of the stator flux magnitude, which is a dc quantity. In addition, both torque and flux are regulated directly with two independent closed-loops. This scheme is relatively insensitive to the noise. The thesis proposed compensation methods to reduce the effects of switch voltage drops and dead-time on the estimation of the stator flux. Experimental results confirm that the estimation error is reduced with compensation for both motoring and generating modes of the ISA. A closed-loop type of sliding mode flux observer is proposed to reduce the estimation error of the stator flux. Both Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed sliding mode observer is insensitive to the stator resistance variation and sensor offsets. A loss minimized scheme with power factor control for the ISA is proposed in this thesis. It provides a simple solution for the efficiency improvement of the induction machine without requiring any speed or load information. The effectiveness of the direct torque controlled induction machine for an integrated starter/alternator system has thus been confirmed and well supported by the studies presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Torque</field><field name="subject">Electric motors, Synchronous</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26224</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Histamine ??? a naturally occurring settlement cue for larvae of the Australian sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens</field><field name="creator">Swanson, Rebecca, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The importance of chemical cues in triggering the settlement of marine invertebrate larvae has long been recognised but very few such cues have been definitively identified. Larvae of the Australian sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens, which lives enmeshed in the fronds of macroalgae, are induced to settle by a water-soluble cue produced by the host alga Delisea pulchra. This cue was previously identified as a floridoside-isethionic acid complex. I present evidence in this thesis which supports histamine as the true settlement cue for larval H. purpurascens. The settlement cue was isolated from the polar extract of D. pulchra by bioassay-guided cation-exchange chromatography and identified as histamine using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Algal derived and synthetic histamine at ~5 ??M induced rapid settlement in 80???100 % of larval H. purpurascens. In the first study of its kind for any marine invertebrate, variation in the distribution of new recruits was compared with quantitative variation in the distribution of histamine in the habitat. More than 90 % of new recruits were found on either the foliose red alga D. pulchra or on coralline turf algae. These algae induced &amp;gt90 % settlement of larvae in laboratory assays after 24 h. D. pulchra contained far higher levels of histamine than all other algae, however, the coralline algae lacked measurable histamine. Seawater collected in situ adjacent to D. pulchra induced up to 16 % settlement of older larvae and contained the highest concentration of histamine (~5 nM). With the exception of coralline algae, variation in settlement and recruitment was consistent with the variation among species histamine contents. Initial results supported a biofilm derived settlement cue from coralline algae. I also showed that older H. purpurascens larvae settle in response to lower concentrations of histamine than younger larvae and required less exposure to histamine (10 ??M) in order to initiate irreversible metamorphosis. Histamine induced settlement of two other echinoids with non-feeding larvae. Histamine did not induce settlement of feeding larvae of two echinoids or settlement of non-feeding larvae of asteroids. Histamine may be a general settlement cue for echinoids with direct development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Histamine</field><field name="subject">Sea urchins</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27240</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients.

Projections for the next 100 years indicate an increase to levels between 490 and 1260 parts per million by volume (ppm) of CO2, equating to a 75 % to 350 % increase in concentration since the year 1750. Associated with this increase in [CO2] will be a 1.4 to 5.8?? C increase in lower atmospheric temperature. While past research has attempted to address the effects of such climatic changes on individual plant responses, predictions of plant responses at the ecosystem level are still highly uncertain. Difficulties lie in the enormous variation of plant responses to climate change variables among and within species, and between and within environmental conditions. Past research assumed that plants using either the C3 or C4 metabolic pathways would respond differently but predictably to climate-change variables based on their metabolic pathway. Recent evidence has suggested however, that the added interactions of external environmental variables and species-specific sensitivities to climate change make it difficult to predict plant and ecosystem responses to climate change. To investigate the mechanisms behind responses of Australian grasses to climate change, 2 pot experiments was conducted using growth cabinets to compare the effect of elevated CO2 and water-limitation on the invasive C4 grassland plant, Eragrostis curvula (E. curvula), native Australian C3 grassland plant, Austrodanthonia racemosa (A. racemosa), and wheat species, Triticum aestivum (T. aestivum). The experiment was run at ambient levels of CO2 maintained at 390 ppm compared to elevated levels of 740 ppm. Imposed restrictions to water supply consisted of gradually drying the soil down to 30 % available soil water (ASW) followed by re-wetting to 50 % ASW.  Well-watered conditions for the experiment consisted of gradually drying the soil down to 50 % ASW, followed by rewetting to 95 % ASW. Plants were grown in mixtures and monocultures, consisting of 9 plants equally spaced in a grid design. The three significant findings of the thesis were that: 1)	the metabolic pathway (C3 versus C4) was not always an accurate predictor of biomass accumulation under elevated CO2 in the plants studied. Previous research suggested that CO2-stimulation of photosynthesis in C3 plants would lead to greater increases in biomass under elevated CO2 compared to C4 plants, though both C3 and C4 plants could benefit from any reduction in stomatal conductance under dry conditions at elevated CO2. The results from the experiments in this thesis showed a strongly significant biomass response to elevated CO2 in both dry and wet conditions for C4 grass E. curvula. The C3 grass A. racemosa in dry conditions, did not. It was speculated that without the CO2-induced water conservation effect, the C3 grass experienced photosynthetic down-regulation and this precluded a positive biomass response under elevated CO2. 2)	the magnitude and direction of biomass response to elevated CO2 was dependant on factors such as resource-availability and the phenotypic variability of the plants species. 3)	critical analysis of results from this thesis, combined with past research on plant responses under elevated CO2 showed a tendency for researchers to repeatedly test plants from the Poaceae family, or close relatives of the Poaceae family. As a result, when past data were corrected for this lack of independence, there was no relationship between the evolution of the C3 and C4 metabolic pathway and biomass response to elevated CO2. Instead, other factors (such as growth rate, plant height, leaf number, etc) were presented as being more important in determining biomass response. These observations were supported by results found in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Water limitation</field><field name="subject">Elevated CO2</field><field name="subject">Australian Grasses</field><field name="subject">Competition</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35671</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High speed comprehensive two-dimenstional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Samiveloo, Silverraji, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of short columns, higher carrier gas velocity and fast temperature programs in Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography coupled to Time-of- Flight Mass Spectrometry (GC x GC/TOFMS) technique is expected to increase the speed of analysis up to several orders of magnitude when compared to conventional gas chromatography (GC) or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). A systematic evaluation of the GC x GC/TOFMS configuration for high-speed applications has received little attention in the literature. The feasibility of High Speed Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (High speed GC x GC/MS) for complex mixtures has been investigated in this thesis. A particular focus was placed on comparing conventional scanning quadrupole mass spectrometry (qMS) with a newly available non-scanning time-of-flight instruments (TOFMS). Experiments were carried out using GC/qMS, GC x GC/qMS, GC/TOFMS and GC x GC/TOFMS both in normal (slow) and fast temperature rates coupled with high frequency modulation in GC x GC. Initially a complex mixture consists of 24 semivolatile compounds was used as the analyte for the above purpose. In the initial experiments parameters like acquisition rate and duty cycle for qMS were determined to evaluate the effectiveness of the instrument for fast analysis. The practical duty cycle value obtained for the qMS was only about 18 % for single ion and one compound at a dwell time of 10 ms in SIM mode. In both high-speed GC/qMS and high-speed GC x GC/qMS techniques only about 40 % of the components in the complex mixture were found to be well separated. The acquisition rate of scanning instruments like qMS is incompatible for fast eluting peaks in high speed GC. TOFMS that has an acquisition rate of several hundred spectra per second offer the potential to define the fast GC peaks accurately. The high quality spectra from TOFMS also enable deconvolution of coeluting peaks in the complex mixtures. The advantage of the automated spectral deconvolution is demonstrated for the identification of the coeluting peaks in the complex mixtures. Coelution of peaks is also observed with highspeed GC/TOFMS technique. The high-speed GC x GC/TOFMS was also tested with two different analyte system ??? A pesticide mixture and platformate (an aromatic mixture) to evaluate the suitability for high-speed analysis of complex mixtures. A poor resolution was observed for the pesticide mixture in the two-dimensional plane and it appeared, as there was nearly no orthogonal separation in the second dimension. The platformate mixture displayed a better two-dimensional separation. Chromatographic peak resolution is not really a primary requirement for locating and identifying the coeluting compounds in high-speed GC x GC/TOFMS technique. However, it was observed that the high-speed GC x GC/TOFMS too faced problem to unscramble the mass spectra of those compounds with similar structure and sharing the same unique masses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quadrupole mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography,</field><field name="subject">Time of-flight Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="subject">duty cycle</field><field name="subject">dwell time</field><field name="subject">acquisition rate</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39732</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of offshore gravity from bathymetry</field><field name="creator">Sproule, David, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The definition of the shape of the geoid is a fundamental objective of geodesy, since it allows for the conversion between orthometric and ellipsoidal height systems. The geoid can be computed from gravity values measured over the surface of the earth, and considerable effort continues to achieve a global coverage of gravity values. One technique that has been very successful in recent years in providing gravity coverage in areas which previously have been too difficult to access is airborne gravimetry. This technique has proved very useful in covering near offshore regions, for example. The coastal regions of Australia are recognised as locations where airborne gravimetry has the potential to fill in missing gravity data. A pilot survey using an airborne gravity meter was undertaken off the north east coast of Australia. In areas that remain unsurveyed it is sometimes useful to fill in the missing gravity data values with predicted gravity values. Previous research has examined the possibility of predicting gravity values from other observed quantities. The best success has been achieved by using the gravity effect calculated from bathymetric information. Often the corresponding isostatic compensation is computed, and the combined bathymetric-isostatic gravity effect is used. However, the type and extent of compensation that exists in any particular region mostly remains unknown. Theoretical considerations indicate that the short wavelength part of the gravity field may be adequately modelled by the gravity effect of the bathymetry alone, without reference to an assumed compensation mechanism. With this in mind, a prediction scheme has been developed which utilises the short wavelength gravity field information implied by the bathymetry, combined with the long wavelength gravity field information from existing observed gravity. This scheme allows the prediction of ???fill-in??? gravity values in areas with limited observed gravity. The prediction technique was used on a test set of data off the east coast of Greenland. The prediction technique was seen to outperform a simple interpolation of gravity values by approximately ten percent. Geoid computations performed with the predicted gravity values indicate that the prediction technique can provide significant improvements in computed geoids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22481</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre in reducing injecting drug use-related harm: evaluating accessibility, utilisation, coverage and selected health impacts</field><field name="creator">Kimber, Joanne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drug Consumption Rooms (DCRs), where injecting drug users (IDUs) can use pre-obtained drugs in a hygienic and professionally supervised low threshold setting, aim to engage high risk IDUs, reduce public drug use, injecting-related morbidity and mortality, and improve access to drug treatment. This thesis evaluates the service demand, accessibility, utilisation, and coverage of Australia???s first DCR, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), located in an area with a history of illegal shooting gallery operation. MSIC impact on injecting practices and injecting related health, and referral to drug treatment were also examined. Methods included cross-sectional IDU surveys, key informant interviews, staff focus groups, analysis of client registration and surveillance data and routinely collected data on needles and syringes - including multiple indirect prevalence estimation, and prospective follow-up of MSIC referrals. Shooting gallery users expressed demand for and willingness to use the MSIC. Injecting episodes previously occurring in shooting galleries appear to have been transferred to the MSIC, although shooting galleries continued to operate at a reduced level. The MSIC service model was accessible, with few refusals of entry, high levels of client satisfaction and limited non-use for reasons relating to the model. MSIC engaged high risk IDUs - regular injectors, sex workers, and those injecting in public places and shooting galleries - who were also more likely to be frequent attendees. MSIC clients were more likely than other IDUs to inject in public places and shooting galleries, be HCV seropositive, have riskier injecting practices and more severe injecting related health problems. MSIC achieved good coverage of the local IDU population (70.7%, range 59.1%-86.7%) and modest coverage of their estimated total injecting episodes during its operating hours (8.8%, range 7.3%-10.8%). MSIC use was associated with improvements in injecting practices and health. Frequent MSIC use was also associated with higher rates of referral to drug treatment than less frequent use. Drug treatment referral uptake was positively associated with a recent history of daily injection and sex work and negatively associated with a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment and/or self harm. This research was confounded by substantial changes in heroin availability during the study period but provides new evidence on DCR coverage, impact on injecting practices and health, and referral to drug treatment. Implications for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narcotics addicts - Services for - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="subject">Injections, Intravenous - Health aspects - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23038</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Static analysis for incomplete object-oriented programs</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Phung Hua, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Static analysis is significant since it provides the information about the run- time behaviour of an analysed program. Such information has many applications in compiler optimisations and software engineering tools. Interprocedural anal- ysis is a form of static analysis, which can exploit information available across procedure boundaries. The analysis is traditionally designed as whole-program analysis, which processes the entire program. However, whole-program analysis is problematic when parts of the analysed program are not available to partici- pate in analysis. In this case, a whole-program analysis has to make conservative assumptions to be able to produce safe analysis results at the expense of some possible precision loss. To improve analysis precision, an analysis can exploit the access control mechanism provided by the underlying program language. This thesis introduces a points-to analysis technique for incomplete object-oriented programs, called com- pleteness analysis, which exploits the access and modification properties of classes, methods and fields to enhance the analysis precision. Two variations of the tech- nique, compositional and sequential completeness analysis, are described. This thesis also presents a mutability analysis (MA) and MA-based side-effect analy- sis, which are based on the output of completeness analysis, to determine whether a variable is potentially modified by the execution of a program statement. The results of experiments carried out on a set of Java library packages are presented to demonstrate the improvement in analysis precision.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Object-oriented programming (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24228</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation patterns for supporting learning and group interactions</field><field name="creator">Kutay, Cat, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis covers research on group learning by using a computer as the medium. The computer software provides the basic blending of the students??? contributions augmented by the effects generated for the specific learning domain by a system of agents to guide the process of the students??? learning. The research is based on the approach that the computer as a medium is not an end point of the interaction. The development of agents in based on Human- Computer-Human interaction or HCH. HCH is about removing the idea that the role of the computer is that of an intelligent agent and reducing its role to that of a mixer, with the ability to insert adaptive electronic (software) components that add extra effects and depth to the product of the human-human interactions. For the computer to achieve this support, it must be able to analyse the input from the individuals and the group as a whole. Experiments have been conducted on groups working face to face, and then on groups using software developed for the research. Patterns of interaction and learning have been extracted from the logs and files of these group sessions. Also a pattern language has been developed by which to describe these patterns, so that the agent support needed to analyse and respond appropriately to each pattern can be developed. The research has led to the derivation of a structure that encompasses all the types of support required, and provides the format for implementing each type of support. The main difficulty in this work is the limited ability of computers to analyse human thoughts through their actions. However progress is made in analysing the level of approach by students to a range of learning concepts. The research identified the separate patterns that contribute to learning agents development and form a language of learning processes, and the agents derived from these patterns could in future be linked into a multi-agent system to support learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer science</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24356</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the mechanism of action of the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin: drug-DNA interactions in reconstituted chromatin and human gene expression profiling</field><field name="creator">Galea, Anne Marie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The DNA-damaging compound, cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum (II)), is a highly successful anti-tumour agent widely used in the treatment of a range of human cancers. Despite the clinical efficacy of cisplatin, its curative potential is largely restricted by the occurrence of drug resistance and several dose-limiting toxic side effects. Attempts to ameliorate these deficiencies have met with limited success. However, it is ultimately hoped that such efforts will benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which cisplatin elicits tumourspecific cytotoxicity. The overall aim of this project was to further elucidate the mechanism of action of cisplatin. For this purpose, different experimental approaches were employed to examine the interaction of cisplatin with DNA, and the drug???s effect on human gene expression. Firstly, chromatin structures native to DNA in human cells were simulated in vitro via reconstitution techniques. Their effect on cisplatin-mediated DNA damage could then be evaluated. Various cisplatin analogues and other DNA-damaging compounds were also investigated in this model system. Secondly, the transcriptional response of human cells to cisplatin treatment was analysed using microarrays and gene expression profiling techniques. Transcript profiles compiled for cisplatin and its clinically ineffective isomer, transplatin, were compared to establish a possible relationship between compound-specific responses and therapeutic efficiency. To assess the relative influence of individual chromatin elements on cisplatin- DNA interactions, the first part of this study employed the octamer transfer method of nucleosome reconstitution to create a defined experimental construct. Standard footprinting techniques allowed the precise location of two positioned nucleosomes to be established with respect to the DNA sequence. The construct was then subjected to drug treatment and the resulting DNA damage was quantitatively analysed using a Taq DNA polymerase stop assay. At sites of damage, densitometric comparisons between purified and reconstituted DNA were used to evaluate the influence of nucleosomal core proteins on specific drug-DNA interactions. For cisplatin and most of the other DNAdamaging agents studied, this method revealed regions of the construct that were relatively protected from drug-induced damage. These regions corresponded to the sites  of the positioned nucleosome cores and indicated that the preferred site of DNA binding for these compounds was in the linker region of the construct. Statistical analyses confirmed the significant level of damage protection conferred by the nucleosome cores and exposed subtle differences between the agents examined. Most prominent among the trends observed, was the negative correlation between compound size and the relative propensity for damaging nucleosomal core DNA. Larger compounds generally displayed a greater tendency to target the linker region of the nucleosomal DNA. In contrast, the access of smaller molecules was not impeded as significantly. In the second stage of the project, the effect of cisplatin on human gene expression levels was described using 19000-gene microarrays and transcription profiling methods. In cultured human cells, cisplatin treatment was shown to significantly up- and down-regulate consistent subsets of genes. Many of these genes responded similarly to treatment with transplatin, the therapeutically inactive isomer of cisplatin. However, a smaller proportion of these transcripts underwent differential expression changes in response to the two isomers. Some of these genes may constitute part of the DNA damage response induced by cisplatin that is critical for its anti-tumour activity. Ultimately, the identification of gene expression responses unique to clinically active compounds, like cisplatin, could thus greatly benefit the design and development of improved chemotherapeutics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cisplatin</field><field name="subject">Human genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24928</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintenance of behaviour when reinforcement becomes delayed</field><field name="creator">Costa, Daniel</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (Phd)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temporal contiguity</field><field name="subject">maintenance</field><field name="subject">hedonic learning</field><field name="subject">sign-tracking</field><field name="subject">goal-tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5078</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse Contexts for Second Language Development in the Mainstream Classroom.</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">In Australian schools in the late nineties approximately one quarter of all students are from a language background other than English. Although many of these students are fluent in English in informal conversational contexts, there is evidence that such students are not always able to control the more academic registers of English associated with school learning and literacy. A major challenge for teachers is therefore to integrate subject learning with English language learning, and to find ways to support the language development of students concurrent with the construction of curriculum knowledge. This study addresses that challenge. Drawing on data from two classrooms of nine and ten year olds in the curriculum area of science, the study explores how the discourse of the classroom can be enabling of language development. It does not attempt to make claims about what might be common to all classrooms, but rather points to those practices which are shown to be supportive of second language learning. The aim therefore is not to suggest what is common to all classroom discourse but what its potential can be for second language development. The study takes as a basic principle the notion that language development interacts dynamically with the socio-cultural context in which it occurs, and cannot be fully understood without taking account of this context. Although the analysis draws on systemic functional linguistics it does not purport to be a study 'in' linguistics, but rather, through a theorisation of practice, seeks to contribute to a theorisation of second language pedagogy in the mainstream classroom. To this end, the analysis is also informed by a neo-Vygotskian approach to learning and teaching, by second language acquisition (SLA) research, and by critically conceived notions of minority education. A number of conclusions are drawn from the study. First, it shows how, through a process of recontextualisation of student talk, the teachers jointly construct with the students aspects of the science register. It concludes that when teachers encourage the dialogic function of discourse to develop, (that is, when knowledge is seen as co-constructed between teacher and learners, rather than transmitted from teacher to learners), this also leads to the kind of teacher-student talk which is most enabling of second language development. The study demonstrates that even apparently minor changes in interactional patterns can have quite major effects on the progress of the discourse as a whole, and can make the difference between discourse which is likely to constrain or facilitate language development and learning. The thesis also shows how the discourse incorporates a range of interactional patterns, each of which tend to be used for distinct pedagogical purposes, and thus how the role of the teachers correspondingly changes at different phases of the teaching and learning cycle. The study concludes that a reconceptualisation of pedagogy is required which foregrounds the relationship between teaching and learning and the nature of teacher mediation in the teaching and learning process. The study identifies other significant factors for language development in the classrooms examined: the language knowledge of the teachers, the explicitness of the discourse, (including explicitness about language and about the social aspects of participating in the class), the sequence of teaching and learning activities, and the importance of the intertextual links, the 'dynamic' context, which were the result of this sequence. Finally, the study points to the value of approaching SLA research and pedagogy with a model of language which goes beyond a description of its phonology, morphology and syntax, one which allows for the study of discourse and for the study of language development in terms of socio-linguistic competence, and for the value of a socio-cultural and classroom-based approach to research into second language learning and pedagogy.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language study and teaching.</field><field name="subject">Primary teaching.</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers.</field><field name="subject">Children of immigrants.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/293</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of suicide grief: meaning making and the griever's relational world.</field><field name="creator">Sands, Diana Catherine Cook</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Adults who are illiterate perform poorly on initial phoneme manipulation tasks, suggesting that learning to read fosters phonemic knowledge. However, literate adults may use orthographic images to aid phoneme manipulation, so this conclusion may be false. In the 11 experiments reported in this thesis, literate English speakers performed phoneme deletion/addition tasks with word and non word items - half had orthographically matched stimuli and responses (wage-age), and half were mismatched (worth-earth). Longer reaction times were expected for orthographically mismatched than matched items. The results of experiments are discussed in some detail.

However, the selection in vivo of HIV-1 mutant species that can escape host immune system HLA class I restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses has, to date, only been documented in a few individuals and its clinical importance is not well understood. This thesis analyses the observed diversity of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase protein in a well characterised, stable, HLA-diverse cohort of HIV-1 infected patients with over two thousand patient-years of observation. The results show that HIV-1 polymorphism is selected within functional constraints and is associated with specific HLA class I alleles. Furthermore, these associations significantly cluster along the sequence and tend to occur within known corresponding HLA-restricted epitopes. Absence of polymorphism is also HLA-specific and more often seen with common HLA alleles. Knowledge of HLA specific viral polymorphisms can be used to model an individual&#146;s viral load from their HLA type and viral sequence. These results suggest that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte escape mutation in HIV-1 is critical to the host at an individual and population level as well as to short and long term viral evolution.

AIS is characterised by delayed and/or reduced egg production and chronic diarrhoea. This thesis describes an investigation into the prevalence, pathogenicity and control of species of avian intestinal spirochaete in Australia. Faeces samples from chickens in 22 flocks of laying hens, 19 broiler flocks and 28 breeder flocks in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were subjected to selective anaerobic culture for Brachyspira species. Spirochaete isolates then were speciated using phenotypic characteristics and specific polymerase chain reaction amplifications. A highly significant association was found between colonisation with Brachyspira species and the occurrence of wet litter and/or reduced production in both broiler breeder and layer flocks in eastern Australia. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) then was used to help confirm the identity of the spirochaetes, and to examine their genetic relationships and disease associations. MLEE divided the isolates into five known Brachyspira species groups: Brachyspira murdochii, B. intermedia, B. pilosicoli, B. innocens, and &#147;B. pulli&#148;. Three new MLEE groups each containing single isolates were also identified. All farms with production problems or wet litter were colonised with the pathogenic species, B. intermedia and/or B. pilosicoli. The pathogenic potential of single isolates of B. pilosicoli and B. innocens then were experimentally evaluated in adult broiler breeders, confirming that infection with B. pilosicoli can result in serious egg production losses, whilst B. innocens is non-pathogenic. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the pathogenic spirochaetes B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia were both susceptible to tiamulin, lincomycin, metronidazole and tetracycline, while a lack of susceptibility to tylosin was found in some isolates of B. intermedia and B. pilosicoli. Some isolates of B. pilosicoli were not susceptible to ampicillin. Additional studies showed that zinc bacitracin, a common feed additive, can increase susceptibility to colonisation with B. pilosicoli. Both tiamulin and lincomycin were shown to be effective in treating infection with B. pilosicoli in adult birds.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">avian intestinal spirochaetosis</field><field name="subject">spirochaetosis</field><field name="subject">brachyspira</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090605.145556</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protection or paternalism: A critical evaluation of Australian legislation relating to sexual acts involving persons with intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">cgraydon@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">As a result of the development and recognition of human rights and of the principle of normalisation, in recent decades sweeping changes have occurred in the living conditions of many people with intellectual disability. 
The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons (1971)contains statements to the effect that, as far as possible, the lives of disabled persons should resemble those of their non-disabled peers, and this presumably extends to sexual expression. However, the words &#147;as far as possible&#148; imply that in some circumstances, limitations on a right may be  justifiable. One such circumstance is where a competing right exists, for example, the right to sexual expression has to be balanced against a right to protection. Under some conditions, the provision of protective measures may fall to the criminal justice system, which may be used to afford protection to persons with intellectual disability. Australian jurisdictions have used three different approaches in current legislation: to set a minimum standard of sexual knowledge that must be present before the person is deemed capable of consent to sexual activities; to prohibit sexual relations with persons holding power or authority over the person; and to proscribe all sexual exploitation. This thesis contains proposals for reforms to each category of legislative provisions. First, it is suggested that the standard of knowledge required to support consent should more closely resemble the knowledge required for informed consent to medical procedures. Second, restrictions on sexual activity with persons with intellectual disability based on employment status should be relaxed where the role of the staff member does not confer power to coerce people with intellectual disability. Third, with regard to the prosecution of offences against incapable persons with mental impairment, it is proposed that the charge should be sex without consent. On the other hand, it is argued that prosecution under criminal law is inappropriate where a vulnerable but capable person is deemed to have been exploited. The thesis contains a number of further recommendations for the reform of anomalies which exist between the general law of sexual offences and those committed specifically against persons with mental impairment. It is suggested that marriage be abolished as a defence to sexual acts with an incapable person and that offences against persons with mental impairment carry equivalent penalties to general sexual offences. On the basis of literature reviewed in this thesis, two additional proposals have  been made. First, that education in the sexual rights of persons with intellectual impairment should be given to carers so that they do not unduly inhibit the development of sexual relationships by that person. The second proposal is that reform should be accompanied by the provision of repeated, appropriate, detailed and specific sex education of all persons with intellectual impairment and that this education should be based on needs identified in the aforementioned research. The tentative outcome of proposals contained in this thesis is that persons capable of consent would enjoy enhanced freedom to exercise their right to sexual expression, and those incapable of consent would be afforded more certain protection.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intellectual disability</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">sexual acts</field><field name="subject">Australian legislation</field><field name="subject">exploitation</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090610.84938</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of alternative grass species on grazing preference of sheep for white clover</field><field name="creator">Muraki, Tomohiro</field><field name="description">Despite the importance of a high white clover (Trifolium repens) content in temperate pastoral systems in terms of livestock performance and nitrogen fixation, the proportion of white clover in grass-clover pastures is often low (&lt;20%). This thesis examined in two experiments whether the white clover content of pastures could be improved by sowing white clover with alternative grass species to diploid perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.).  In a pasture experiment, DM production, pasture composition and morphology of grass-clover mixtures was measured over the establishment year (January 2007 to January 2008) where white clover was sown in fine mixtures with diploid perennial ryegrass, tetraploid perennial ryegrass, timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.). Pastures were irrigated and rotationally grazed with on-off grazing with  Coopworth ewe hoggets. Total annual DM production of pasture was more than 20% higher in tetraploid (12521 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) and diploid (11733 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) perennial ryegrass than timothy (9751 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) and cocksfoot (9654 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;). However, timothy (5936 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) and cocksfoot (5311 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) had more than four times higher white clover annual DM production than tetraploid (1310 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) and diploid (818 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185;) ryegrass. Pasture growth rate at the first three harvests in autumn was significantly greater in tetraploid and diploid ryegrass than timothy and cocksfoot. Timothy and cocksfoot had a higher proportion of white clover than tetraploid and diploid perennial ryegrass throughout the entire year. This was due to more and larger white clover plants in timothy and cocksfoot plots. In a grazing preference experiment, the partial preference of sheep for white clover offered in combination with the same grass species as in the pasture experiment was measured in five grazing tests in May, September, October, November and December 2007. Pastures were sown in January 2007. Paired plots (grass and clover both 4.2 m x 10 m) were grazed by three Coopworth ewe hoggets between 9am and 5pm, and preference was recorded by decline in pasture mass and visual scan sampling for grazing time. Grazing preference for clover was generally low throughout these tests (e.g. average apparent DM intake from clover = 47%; average grazing time from clover = 44%). Several explanations are proposed for this low preference including a high N content and intake rate of the grass relative to the clover. No significant differences were found among the grass treatments in total grass grazing time, total clover grazing time, ruminating time, the proportion of grazing time on clover, selective coefficient for clover and DM intake percentage from clover at any date. There was no significant change in overall sward surface height (SSH) decline among grass treatments throughout all the tests except December 2007 when the overall SSH decline for cocksfoot was significantly lower than the other species. The study indicated that the rapid growth rate of perennial ryegrass in the early phase of pasture establishment, rather than differences in partial preference, was the key factor limiting white clover content in the mixed swards relative to cocksfoot and timothy pastures. It is concluded that high clover-containing pastures capable of delivering high per head performance can be established through the use of slow establishing pasture species such as timothy and cocksfoot.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">white clover</field><field name="subject">cocksfoot</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">timothy</field><field name="subject">grazing preference</field><field name="subject">tetraploid perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">diploid perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne</field><field name="subject">Phleum pratense</field><field name="subject">Dactylis glomerata</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens</field><field name="subject">mixed swards</field><field name="subject">monocultures</field><field name="subject">growth rate</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300205 Agronomy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300499 Animal production not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1095</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative description of the adult patient experience of cancer-related cachexia (CRC) : a pilot study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Nursing, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stubbs, Marika Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the experience of living with cancer-related cachexia (CRC) from the patient perspective. Critique of the literature indicates few examples where patients have had the opportunity to speak. Following a challenging recruitment process, six people living with the syndrome were interviewed to elicit their narrative. Their stories were examined and themes identified relating to their personal feelings and how these affected social interactions. Thematic analysis was applied to produce what is a rich qualitative description of the experience from this small sample. Living with CRC requires development of strategies to survive. Emergent themes included the loss of sense of self and a changing relationship to the social world, social isolation and dissatisfaction with truth-telling by health professionals. Recommendations are made to mitigate the suffering of patients by empowering them through better information and acknowledgement of their condition. The balance between nutrition and wellbeing is re-examined, calling for a reorientation of perspective from a focus on intake towards a focus on quality of life. This clearly falls within the nurse-as patient-advocate paradigm and the relevance and meaning of this research to the nursing profession is explored. Potential areas for further research in regards to both patient experience and nursing practice are extrapolated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer-related cachexia</field><field name="subject">cancer patients</field><field name="subject">involuntary wasting syndrome</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321015 Oncology and carcinogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/785</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource provisioning and management in hybrid sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Hu, Wen, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of embedded system technologies have made it feasible to deploy large-scale sensor and actuator networks. These networks are revolutionizing the way in which we understand, monitor and control complex physical environment, and provide one of the missing connections between the Internet and the physical world. Because of size, form factor and cost considerations, wireless sensor networks suffer from severe resource constraints, such as communication bandwidth and range, computation power, memory and energy. Furthermore, sensor networks are expected to consist of hundreds of sensors in the future. The resource constraints of tiny embedded devices, together with the large network size, create many research challenges which do not appear in traditional networks. In this dissertation, we address the challenges involved in designing robust and scalable sensor network system. In contrast to the flat networking model considered in previous sensor networks research, we propose a hierarchical or hybrid network architecture which is more scalable and robust. Hybrid sensor networks consist of resource-impoverished sensors and resource-rich sensors, called micro-servers. Because of the different capabilities of heterogeneous devices in hybrid sensor networks, there is need for effective deployment and utilization of network resources. Therefore, we introduce resource provisioning and management algorithms to optimize the performance of hybrid sensor networks. The first contribution of this dissertation is the design and implementation of new network architecture and algorithms to address the computation power and memory limitations of tiny embedded devices. The second contribution of this dissertation is the design and evaluation of an Anycast communication paradigm for hybrid sensor and actuator networks. We propose and evaluate a reverse tree-based Anycast mechanism tailored to deal with the unique event dynamics in sensor networks. The third contribution of this dissertation is the design and evaluation of an energy provisioning and management algorithm for hybrid sensor and actuator networks. Our studies show that the location of extra energy-provisioning can affect the lifetime of system dramatically; and hybrid sensor networks are financially cost-effective for a large number of cases which makes them a scalable solution. Together, these contributions enable effective resource provisioning and management in hybrid sensor networks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25174</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a laboratory facility for testing shear performance of installed rock reinforcement elements</field><field name="creator">Mahony, Luke T, School of Mining, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rock reinforcing elements provide a significant proportion of their ground control capability through offering resistance to shear movement of adjacent rock masses or blocks. This potential shear movement may take the form of sliding on horizontal bedding planes leading to strata bending; or block displacement along other geological structures such as joints or similar discontinuities. Much has been reported about this type of behaviour of rock bolts and other tendons, in theoretical concepts. However, there is a shortage of quality data available on the exact nature of this mechanism for shear resistance, and the role played by parameters such as pre-tensioning. A clearer understanding of the nature and significance of this type of behaviour has major implications for rock reinforcing materials and installation design. This thesis, which was supported by the Australian Coal Research Program (ACARP) describes the design, construction and commissioning of a laboratory testing facility at the School of Mining Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia and a subsequent testing program. The single failure plane design adopted in the test rig has been successful in allowing shear loading to be directly applied to fully installed rockbolts. Rockbolts were installed into an offset concrete rockmass, which consisted of two separate concrete samples that created a smooth shear plane surface. The reinforced samples were subjected to an applied shear load and critical parameters such as load and shear displacement were recorded. Influencing parameters such as concrete strength and applied pre-tension were altered and recorded to determine their effects on the overall shear performance of the sample. The failure mode of the rockbolts was also examined. The results indicate that a relative stronger rockmass material caused the rockbolt to fail within a lower shear displacement compared to a relatively  weaker material. Also, a pre-tensioned rockbolt tended to resist shear displacement at least initially, until high shear loads developed. This phenomena is beneficial to ground support as less movement would tend to maintain integral strength of the rockmass. The use of strain-gauged rockbolts indicated as would be expected that the shear loading arrangement induced a compressive axial loading that tended to dissipate with distance from the shear surface.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laboratories -- Australia -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Mining engineering -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics</field><field name="subject">Rocks -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Rock bolts -- Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25700</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bioavailability of folic acid in pectin - coated fortified rice in humans using stable isotope techniques</field><field name="creator">de Ambrosis, Alison, School of Food Science &amp; Technology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rice is an important dietary grain but may be difficult to fortify with water-soluble vitamins due to the losses incurred during processing and preparation. Edible coatings can offer reasonable protection against folate processing losses in fortified rice, in particular pectin (Shrestha, 2003). However, pectin, an indigestible fibre, may entrap or bind added folate, decreasing its absorption efficiency. Healthy volunteers (n=26, 18-39 yrs) received oral 400??g [13C5]PteGlu doses in three separate test meals in randomized cross-over trials as follows: 1) aqueous 2) 200g white rice and 3) 200g of pectin-coated rice premix. A plasma AUC0-8 was conducted (0, 1, 2, 5 and 8 hrs postprandial). Subjects followed a low folate basal diet (112??12 ??g/day) - verified using L.casei microbiological assay - during the AUC and for 24 hours prior. Optimisation of the pectin-coated rice premix gave folic acid coating and cooking losses of 33.5% and 15.5% respectively. The mean test dose error per 400??g folic acid was ?? 26 ??g. Single- or tri- enzyme extraction of fortified rice extracts did not significantly increase the mean assayable folate content compared to the mean folic acid content. The levels of plasma [13C5]5-methyl-THF, [13C5]PteGlu and 5-methyl-THF were quantified using a validated HPLC-tandem MS method. The calibration curves indicated good response linearity in the 0-100 ng/mL range (R2&amp;gt0.9978). Inter- and intra-assay variation of 5-methyl-THF (100 ng/mL) was 6.9% (n=6) and 5.2% (n=4) respectively. The mean recovery of 5, 20 and 50 ng/mL 5-methyl-THF in spiked plasma extracts was 98.6 ?? 8.7%, 89.3 ?? 2.8% and 92.6 ?? 3.7% (n=3) respectively. Standard Reference Material-1846, infant formula (129??28 ??g/100g) was measured at 110 ?? 15 ??g folic acid/100g. The relative bioavailability of the folic acid in meals 2 and 3 was measured by comparing their [13C5]5-methyl-THF AUC???s relative to meal 1. The relative bioavailabilities (Mean % ?? CI) of meals 2 and 3 were 86.5 ?? 4.6 % and 68.7 ?? 5.4 % respectively. It appears the pectin coat moderately reduces short-term folic acid bioavailability. These studies define the basis for calculating the amount of folic acid to be added to rice so that an adequate amount can be absorbed after coating and cooking losses. Pectin coatings may be a useful means of increasing the folate status of populations that rely heavily on rice as a staple.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Folic acid</field><field name="subject">Rice</field><field name="subject">Pectin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26121</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designers and users: a survey of user research methods employed by Australian industrial designers</field><field name="creator">Ward, Stephen James, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Designers of mass produced products require knowledge about anticipated users of their designs in order to make reasonable predictions about how users will interact with a product and how that product will satisfy users??? needs.

Study in this area is important, in order to have a knowledge base that will support development of methods and data sources that may help designers and others bring a better understanding of users into the product design process.  In this study, group interviews and a questionnaire were used to ask industrial designers how and where they get information about users, and about their perceptions of the role and value of user research in design.  The group discussions involved a total of 45 participants from nine companies in Sydney.  A questionnaire that followed was completed by 35 respondents representing at least 15 different design consultancy companies throughout Australia.  Results showed that the designers surveyed used many of the methods promoted in the literature of ergonomics, design and market research, but often in a cut-down form.  For example, there was widespread use of work colleagues and family members as test subjects.  Designers used quantitative information where it was applicable but often sought qualitative information that would provide insights or enable them to develop empathic understanding of the users.  Time and cost constraints limited the extent to which designers could engage in user research activity but there was general agreement that user research was a necessary part of design and that in the future designers will require a stronger capability in user research.  Further research could focus on the evaluation of user research methods used in design and the potential for further collaboration between designers and other specialists in this area.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human engineering</field><field name="subject">Industrial design -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26206</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Donne???s Holy Sonnets and Calvin</field><field name="creator">Chong, Kenneth Tze Aun, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Criticism on Donne???s Holy Sonnets has traditionally been concerned with trying to find an explanation for the doubt, anxiety, and despair that is often expressed by the speaker of those poems. In recent decades, critics have increasingly made recourse to Calvinist theology in an effort to explain these melancholy states of mind. The accounts that such critics provide of ???Calvinism,??? however, have been varied and largely inadequate, mainly because they fail to engage with Calvin???s work at the level it requires. My thesis seeks to correct such deficiencies by providing a detailed reading of Calvin???s view on salvation and the way in which it is received. Calvin argues that we obtain salvation through a firm and certain faith, a faith that is nevertheless attacked by the unbelief that still resides in the believer. In other words, there is a division between the flesh and the spirit within the soul of the believer, which means that he or she is never free (until death) from the sinful temptations of this life. This division, which Calvin invokes to reconcile the uncertainties of the Christian life with the assurance of faith, is dramatised in the Holy Sonnets. In the five poems that I analyse, the speaker is torn between a desire for righteousness and an inclination toward evil, a division that is also represented in the structural qualities of the text. The various temptations which the speaker registers and confronts (and often falls to) are, I believe, a demonstration of Calvin???s view that the regenerate person is in continuous warfare against the remnants of the flesh.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Donne, John, 1572-1631 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Sonnets, English -- History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26154</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A year in the city</field><field name="creator">Peek, Benjamin Michael, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">A Year in the City is a mosaic novel set in contemporary an historical Sydney. It is 70, 000 words long, and contains twelve different narratives, with the American author Mark Twain appearing as a fictional character in the opening and closing. A Year in the City seeks to represent the fragmented, multicultural nature of Sydney through a diverse range of narrators and styles. Each of the chapters is linked through the themes of belonging, race, land ownership. The Sydney portrayed in the novel is what Leonie Sandercock called a Mongrel City, a metaphor used to characterise the &amp;quotnew urban condition in which difference, otherness, fragmentation, splintering, multiplicity, heterogeneity, diversity, [and] plurality prevail.&amp;quot A Year in the City intends to celebrate cultural and racial heterogeneity. It is accompanied by a research dissertation of 30, 000 words, that investigates the project of writing about the city and the theme of race. It explores the imagined city through the work of James Donald and Ross Gibson, and addresses the challenge of capturing the lived experience in text, as theorised by Henri Lefebvre. The mosaic structure of A Year in the City borrows from Michel de Certeau's theory of walking the city and Walter Benjamin's flaneur. The issue of race is discussed in relation to the representation of white and non-white characters against the dominant white society.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City and town life</field><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26278</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Markers of nutritional assessment in children with gastrointestinal illnesses</field><field name="creator">Aurangzeb, Brekhna, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  Nutritional status affects every aspect of a child?s health. Thorough nutritional assessment is hampered by the lack of a single comprehensive tool, which can cover all aspects of nutritional assessment. In three distinct studies, this thesis investigated the nutritional status of hospitalised children, children with coeliac disease and children with inflammatory bowel disease. Study 1 The objectives of this study were to assess prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk, and define demographic and anthropometric factors associated with nutritional risk among hospitalized children. In this cross sectional study, 157 hospitalised children were assessed for nutritional status using nutritional risk score (NRS) and anthropometric measurements. We found that 4.5%, 8.9%, 15.1% and 10.4% children were wasted, stunted, overweight and obese respectively. However, with the NRS, 47.8% of the children were at high nutritional risk. These children at high risk had lower weight for age (p=0.02), lower BMI percentiles for age (p=0.001) and longer hospitalization (p=0.001) than children at no risk. Study 2 The objectives of this study were to determine nutritional parameters in children with coeliac disease. Twenty-five children with coeliac disease and an equal number of age and gender matched controls were enrolled and anthropometric measurements, BIA and leptin levels were analysed in all. No significant differences were found between the children with coeliac disease and controls in these parameters. BMI percentile correlated with leptin levels in children with coeliac disease. Study 3 The objectives of this study were to determine anthropometric parameters and leptin levels in children with IBD and ascertain if BMI correlates with leptin levels in these children. Thirty children with IBD and 60 age and gender matched controls were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements and leptin levels were analysed and compared with controls. IBD children had significantly low weight for age (p=0.002), BMI percentiles (p=0.001) and leptin levels (p=0.009) compared to controls. There was a correlation between BMI and leptin levels in IBD children. In conclusion, this thesis has shown that one quarter of hospitalized children were overweight or obese, and further, that half of the hospitalised children were at high risk of nutritional deterioration and these children had longer hospital stay than children at no risk. Children with coeliac disease had similar anthropometric measurements, body compartments and leptin levels to controls. However, children with IBD had lower anthropometric measurements and leptin levels, indicating under-nutrition. Nutritional assessment should be a mandatory part of clinical management with nutritional status assessed by various tools including NRS, anthropometry, BIA and leptin levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutritional assessment.</field><field name="subject">Nutritional risk scores.</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis.</field><field name="subject">Serum leptin.</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry.</field><field name="subject">Coeliac disease.</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41109</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Marquis de Sade and the Cinema of Transcendence</field><field name="creator">Page, Rosalyn Geraldine, Media &amp; Communications, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an enquiry into the Marquis de Sade, his writing and the perversion known as sadism. The narrower focus of this thesis investigates the problem of the meeting of violence and language in Sade's novels and the implications for cinema. The procedure has been to adopt the Critical and Clinical approach to philosophy that brings together both the literary style of Sade and the clinical symptoms of sadism. This method canvasses a number of Sades novels to consider the psychoanalytical definition of sadism before moving on to discuss the expression of sadism through language. Finally, the model of sadism and language is then applied to a number of films to discuss how violence within the context of sadism functions through language within cinema. The general results show how speech and action can be defined as equivalent forms of sadian violence when expressed through language in both literature and cinema. This occurs, furthermore, through the transcendent model of violence where both speech and action refer to a higher order of violence and this is put at the service of the senses through language. The major conclusions reached suggest that language in literature and cinema can be a demonstrative form of the higher order of violence. Sadism draws out the violence and excess of the world by reflecting it within language. In doing so, violence is designated with a quality of the erotic through this excess. Finally, each act of violence within literature and cinema is an attempt to overcome taboos through transgression. The breaking of a taboo creates an amount of excess but also reinstates the taboo in what becomes an empty act of transgression. The excess is expressed through violence within language and deed according to a transcendent function of language in literature and cinema.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sade</field><field name="subject">sadism</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">Gilles Deleuze</field><field name="subject">cinema</field><field name="subject">literature</field><field name="subject">clinical and critical</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">psychoanalysis</field><field name="subject">Freud</field><field name="subject">transgression</field><field name="subject">taboo</field><field name="subject">excess</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18656</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving mobile IP handover latency on end-to -end TCP in UMTS/WCDMA networks</field><field name="creator">Lau, Chee Kong, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to terminal mobility and change of service area, efficient IP mobility support is an important aspect in UMTS networks in order to provide mobile users negligible packet loss rate and low handover latency, and thus some level of guaranteed quality-ofservice (QoS) to support real-time applications. 3G/UMTS has been specified and implemented as an end-to-end mobile communications system. The underlying WCDMA access systems manage radio access handover (layer 1) and provide linklayer mobility (layer 2) in terms of connection setup and resource management. For the UMTS nodes to have seamless connectivity with the Internet, the UMTS core networks need to be able to support continuous and no network service session handover (layer 3 and above). A long IP handover latency results in high packet loss rate and severely degrades its end-to-end transport level performance. Network-layer handover latency has therefore been regarded as one of the fundamental limitations in IP-based UMTS networks. Therefore, it is crucial to provide efficient network-layer mobility management in UMTS/WCDMA networks for seamless end-to-end TCP connection with the global Internet.  Mobility of UMTS nodes necessitates extra functionalities such as user location tracking, address registration and handover related mechanisms. The challenge to provide seamless mobility in UMTS requires localised location management and efficient IP handover management. Mobile IPv6 protocol offers a better mobility support as the extended IPv6 features with mobility mechanism are integrated to the mobile nodes. To mitigate the effect of lengthy IP handover latency, two well-known handover reducing mechanisms based on Mobile IPv6 support have been proposed in the literature. They are designed with hierarchical network management and address pre-configuration mechanism. Hierarchical management aims to reduce the network registration time, and fast-handover attempts to minimise the address resolution delay. S-MIP (Seamless Mobile IP) integrates the key benefits of the above IP mobility mechanisms coupled with local retransmission scheme to achieve packet lossless and extremely low handover latency, operating in WLAN environments.  In this thesis, we explore the possible Mobile IP solutions and various IP handover optimisation schemes in IPv6 to provide seamless mobility in UMTS with the global Internet. It aims at developing an optimised handover scheme that encompasses the packet lossless and extremely low handover latency scheme in S-MIP, and applying it into the UMTS/WCDMA packet data domain. Therefore, the hybrid UMTS-SMIP architecture is able to meet the requirements of delay sensitive real-time applications requiring strict delay bound, packet lossless and low handover latency performance for end-to-end TCP connection during a UMTS IP-based handover. The overall seamless handover architecture in UMTS facilitates integrated, scalable and flexible global IP handover solution enabling new services, assuring service quality and meeting the user???s expectations in future all-IP UMTS deployment. The viability of the seamless mobility scheme in UMTS is reflected through and validated in our design model, network protocol implementation, and service architecture. We illustrate the performance gained in QoS parameters, as a result of converged UMTS-SMIP framework compared to other Mobile IPv6 variants. The simulation results show such a viable and promising seamless handover scheme in UMTS on IP handover latency reduction on its end-to-end TCP connection.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile IPv6; Seamless Mobility; IP Handover; UMTS/WCDMA.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins of the banlieue rouge: politics, local government and communal identity in Arcueil and Cachan, 1919-1958.</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Jasen Lewis, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">By elucidating the origins of the banlieue rouge, a belt of communist-dominated suburbs surrounding Paris that arose during the interwar years and reached its apogee under the Fourth Republic, this thesis addresses the problem of why twentieth-century France was home to a pro-Soviet communist party with mass support. Specifically, a local study of the PCF in Arcueil and Cachan, two neighbouring communes south of Paris with divergent political evolutions since World War I, is used to discern how and why the Parti communiste fran??ais (PCF) came to exert hegemony in the working-class suburbs of Paris. After surveying the historiography of communism in France and beyond, this thesis concludes that the communist banlieue rouge was born of working-class alienation from bourgeois society that was nourished by a communist counter-society that was contingent upon the PCF???s capacity to adapt and respond to local circumstances. Using archival sources and statistical analysis, it demonstrates that in Arcueil and Cachan rapid suburbanisation and an attendant proletarianisation created the pre-conditions for the rise of the PCF. This study finds that during the interwar period the PCF rapidly emerged as an electoral force in both suburbs as it set about laying the foundations of a communist counter-society, especially in Arcueil where it won control of local government in 1935. In Arcueil, the PCF spearheaded the local Resistance movement during World War II and then under the Fourth Republic went on to consolidate a nascent communist communal identity, while in Cachan its influence fell victim to Cold War politics. The pre-conditions for the rise of communism were apparent earlier and to a greater degree in Arcueil, an industrialised, working-class suburb with long-standing radical traditions, than in the traditionally conservative Cachan. In Arcueil, the PCF was more successful than its counterpart in Cachan at exploiting an alienation that was not only part of the deep-seated historical traditions of the French working class but was also part of everyday life f or workers forced to live in miserable conditions. In suburbs such as Arcueil, suburban working-class pride at being a social outcast was conflated with communism to create a durable communist communal identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of exposure to Chaozhou Xianshi music on pre-service teachers??? development as music educators</field><field name="creator">Ng, Chun-Hoi Daniel, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent music educational reforms in Hong Kong stress the need to cultivate students??? understanding toward Chinese music.

A xianshi music ensemble was formed to expose the trainees to practical experiences of the genre. During their final teaching practice session, the trainees were asked to design and teach xianshi and Chinese music in schools. Qualitative data were collected from interviews and an analysis of video-recordings of their teaching. Findings revealed that a sequenced exposure in xianshi music was advantageous for the trainees to develop their potential and competence to teach Chinese music, as was evident in these trainees??? teaching approaches and implementation.  Findings suggest that Hong Kong music teachers should adopt the techniques proposed in this study. Importantly, music teachers should demonstrate their role as transmitters of musical heritage and be capable to design and implement effective lessons, to involve their students to practical experiences in traditional Chinese music, and to develop their students intellectually and artistically so that they become informed consumers of their own and other musical traditions. In the long run, these approaches may help to increase the valuing of Chinese music and culture among students and citizens in the society more generally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Folk music -- China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24249</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mean-field analysis of basal ganglia and thalamocortical dynamics</field><field name="creator">van Albada, Sacha Jennifer</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mean-field modeling</field><field name="subject">basal ganglia</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's disease</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">thalamus</field><field name="subject">cortex</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">normal distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/5124</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between respiration rate and storage life of fresh produce</field><field name="creator">Bower, Jenny H.</field><field name="description">This project examines whether there is a direct link between respiration and the rate of senescence of fresh produce. Treatments that increase the storage life of fresh products, such as cooling, modified atmospheres and semi-permeable coatings, often decrease respiration rates. This suggests that it may be possible to assess the effectiveness of a specific storage treatment in terms of its effect on reducing respiration. If this is so, total respiration during storage should sum to a constant regardless of changes in the storage conditions. Such an equivalence between 'respiration life' and storage life has been demonstrated in only a few cases. Respiration data from a wide range of published work was analysed from the viewpoint of testing this hypothesis. In general, the results were positive, with some reservations that were further investigated by experiment. In conclusion, respiration rate may be a guide to storage life for products that have clearly defined stages of senescence, and for which rots are not the primary cause of the end of acceptability. The development of the respirometer should make it possible to examine this relationship for many other commodities. However, while respiration may be a function of the rate of senescence under some circumstances, it is also affected by other factors. These include photosynthesis, attachment to the plant, and permeance to gases. Directions for future work therefore include the contribution of photosynthesis to fruit development, the effects of ethylene on respiration rates of non-climacteric fruit while attached to the plant, and interactions between ethylene synthesis and disease resistance</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">respiration rate of plants</field><field name="subject">senescence of fresh produce</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">ethylene synthesis</field><field name="subject">disease resistance</field><field name="subject">storage life of fresh produce</field><field name="subject">respirometer</field><field name="subject">photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">fruit development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/110</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An archive of caring for nursing</field><field name="creator">Bourgeois, Sharon</field><field name="description">The central concern of this thesis is the diversity of the discourses of caring within nursing knowledge. Drawing on three of the tools of &#8216;Foucauldian archaeology&#8217;, namely the statement, discursive formation and discourse, &#8216;An archive of Caring for Nursing&#8217; is identified. At least three discourses comprise this archive. These are &#8216;caring as being&#8217;, &#8216;caring as doing&#8217;, &#8216;caring as knowing&#8217;. Each discourse is described in the thesis and critically analysed for influences on contemporary nursing knowledge, education, theory, management and practice. Practice exemplars are utilised to elaborate the conflict between the author&#8217;s discursive position and the positions of other nurse practitioners and educators. The thesis contributes to nursing knowledge, nurse education and practice. How nurses are positioned within discourses of caring and how they resist within these discourses, is especially significant for nursing&#8217;s future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing ethics</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">nurses</field><field name="subject">attitudes</field><field name="subject">professional relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/22766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Through others' eyes : intercultural education in the Australian context : the case for global and regional education</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, John D.</field><field name="description">The overarching theme of this doctoral portfolio is the issue of intercultural education. Linked to this are several sub-themes: teacher excellence and professional development; curriculum development and the acquisition of values and attitudes. These themes have been developed through studies of Asia and global education in the Australian context. One major outcome of this research is the development of a hybrid theoretical model, based on two pre-existing models, for examining curriculum in schools, as it is expressed in artefacts such as scope and sequence documents, as well as through practice and discourse by teachers and students. The research also generated a continuum to measure the effectiveness and extent of curricular change. The combination of these two artefacts provides an instrument for examining and mapping the progress and processes of curricular change with regard to fields such as studies of Asia. The model and other findings from this series of studies also pave the way for further examining the processes and outcomes of curricular change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural education</field><field name="subject">education in Australia</field><field name="subject">school curricular</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/656</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The photodynamic effect on micro-organisms found on packaging materials</field><field name="creator">Zerdin, Katherine</field><field name="description">Many types of foods are sterilised and packaged aseptically to maximise their shelf life and ensure that they are safe for consumption. However, if even a few micro-organisms survive these treatments, the quality and/or safety of the food can be seriously compromised. Therefore, packaging materials that can actively participate in the process of inactivating micro-organisms have a potentially important role in protecting the quality and safety of packaged foods. The aim of this project is to explore the effectiveness of the photodynamic effect as a method of inactivating micro-organisms on the surface of packaging materials. Photodynamic action occurs when a photosensitiser molecule absorbs light in the presence of oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen, superoxide radicals, or other free radicals; these species are known to inactivate cells. Medical uses of photodynamic action have been studied extensively, usually in applications where the reactive oxygen species are produced intracellularly. However, very little research has been conducted to investigate the efficacy of extra-cellularly generated reactive oxygen species on the viability of micro-organisms, and accordingly this research project investigated the possibility that this approach might be used for inactivating micro-organisms on packaging materials. The results of this study indicate that singlet oxygen may be produced at the surface of polymer films that contain selected photosensitisers, resulting in the oxidation of known singlet-oxygen acceptors to form endoperoxides. This provides evidence that singlet-oxygen mediated reactions can occur at the surface of a sensitising film. It is likely that cell destruction is caused by singlet-oxygen, rather than involving other activated species. It was further shown that the photodynamically generated singlet-oxygen can inactivate micro-organisms (extra-cellularly) on the surface of a polymeric material. The study included examples from each genus of micro-organisms that are of concern to the food and packaging industry, including: Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli); Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus), both vegetative cells and endospores; yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and mould (Fusarium oxysporium.) Results indicate that the photodynamic effect causes a substantial reduction in viable cell numbers for vegetative cells and spores (both bacterial and fungal) that have been inoculated onto a plastic surface containing the photosensitiser, anthraquinone,. The results show that an increase in the amount of reactive oxygen species produced by photodynamic action increases the inactivation rate of the micro-organisms. The micro-organisms investigated were susceptible to photodynamic action to varying extents. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that control of microbial populations on the surface of polymeric films (used in food packaging) is achievable using photodynamic action produced from polymers, based on the reported amounts of micro-organisms found on food packaging materials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food</field><field name="subject">packaging</field><field name="subject">safety measures</field><field name="subject">oxidation</field><field name="subject">energy transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38634</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'A bastard Gaelic man' : reconsidering the highland roots of Adam Ferguson</field><field name="creator">Testa, Denise A.</field><field name="description">This thesis attacks the neglected and unresolved historiographical problem connecting Adam Ferguson&#8217;s work, in particular, his Essay on the History of Civil Society, to his early life experience. During the 1960s and 1970s, the issue of Ferguson&#8217;s Highland background first came to the fore. A knowledge of Gaelic marked Ferguson out from his colleagues, denoting his status as a Highlander. Michael Kugler&#8217;s 1994 study examined how Ferguson and his contemporaries constructed an idealised representation of Highland society. My investigation takes a novel approach by concentrating on matters relating to the concrete reality of the locale, language and vestigial shame-honour culture. These were imbibed by Ferguson during his childhood and early adult life. During these phases, Ferguson became conversant in the Gaelic language which acted as a conduit for the mores, history and legends of Highland communities. The elements of the shame-honour culture, the neural pathways generated by Gaelic, and Highland orality, all left their mark on him. Evidence of these component influences can be identified in his Essay, correspondence and other works. An analysis of Ferguson&#8217;s correspondence confirms his native-like control of the Gaelic sound system, indicating fluency from a young age. Ferguson experienced a traditional, communal way of life in transition. During his lifetime, there was an increasing drive to modernise the rural parts of Scotland. His insider-knowledge of two cultures, together with his familiarity of two naturally acquired grammatical systems, provided him with some unique intuitive perceptions. Ferguson&#8217;s works and his success as a university lecturer testify to his assimilation and integration into mainstream Scotto-British eighteenth-century intellectual culture. Nevertheless, his writing bears some hallmarks of alternating cultural loyalties and the occasional affirmation of his first culture. This thesis provides a new dimension to the understanding of Ferguson&#8217;s early enculturation, by inviting fresh explication of important passages of his writing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ferguson, Adam, 1723-1816</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">Scottish Gaelic language</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38582</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological Associations of the Hooded Parrot (Psephotus dissimilis)</field><field name="creator">Cooney, Stuart John Norman</field><field name="description">Interactions between nesting birds and invertebrates are a common, yet poorly understood ecological phenomenon. Many of these types of interactions are close and prolonged, and therefore potentially critical to one or both of the species involved in the interaction. However it is unusual for the nature of the interaction to be evaluated in a manner that reveals the impact of the relationship on both parties to the interaction. This study examines two relationships between nesting birds and invertebrates, both of which involve the hooded parrot (Psephotus dissimilis), a small grass parrot that inhabits the tropical savannas of northern Australia.
&#182;
The field-work for this project was conducted over two parrot breeding seasons in 2006 and 2007 near Katherine, Northern Territory, in the Australian dry tropics. In chapter II, I present data on the breeding biology of the hooded parrot as background for the study that follows. Nest building commenced in January, with peak activity in February and the last chicks fledged in April. Fifty three active nests were located. The mean number of eggs laid per nest was 4.5 (s.d. &#177; 0.9), of which 3.0 (&#177; 1.79) hatched and 2.0 (&#177; 2.0) fledged. Clutches were laid asynchronously over a period of a week and chicks remained in eggs for 18.6 (&#177; 1.95 days). Chicks were 29.2 (&#177; 2.9) days old when they fledged from the nest. These data are typical for Australian parrots. 
&#182;
In chapter III, the unusual nature of the parrot&#146;s nest site is examined. Many species of bird nest in natural cavities or those they excavate. Whilst cavity nesters as a whole experience increased nesting success, the greatest success is experienced by species that can excavate their own nests. Certain arboreal cavity nesters, such as woodpeckers, require extensive morphological adaptation for this behaviour, but this has not occurred in Australia, despite competition among birds and a suite of arboreal mammals for naturally occurring cavities. Some species, however, have adapted their behaviour to make use of substrates that are not as hard as wood. Hooded parrots excavate nests in terrestrial termitaria, releasing them from competition for limited arboreal cavities. However, I show that only termitaria with a high level of termite activity, and which are more than two metres tall, are suitable, and that the parrots exhibit a strong preference for the cathedral mounds of Nasutitermes triodiae. Nests placed in highly active mounds had a significantly higher success rate than those in mounds where activity was somewhat lower, suggesting that the behaviour is adaptive.
&#182;
The thesis then shifts focus from the parrot to its nest symbiont, first describing the species involved in the interaction in chapter IV, and then its behaviour in the nests of hooded parrots in chapter V. Trisyntopa neossophila sp. n. (Lepidoptera: Oecophoridae) was reared from the nest of the hooded parrot and described using morphological characters. Aspects of its biology are reported and similarities to the biology of Trisyntopa scatophaga found in the nests of the golden-shouldered parrot (Psephotus chrysopterygius) are discussed. The possibility that a moth was associated with the extinct paradise parrot (Psephotus pulcherrimus) is considered in the light of the phylogenetic relationships between the parrots.
&#182;
Trisyntopa neossophila is an unusual moth whose breeding cycle is shown to be closely synchronised with the hooded parrot. T. neossophila is one of three coprophagous, nest dwelling moths in the genus Trisyntopa. True coprophagy is rare in the Lepidoptera, although some species occasionally consume faeces to gain rare nutrients. T. neossophila lays its eggs in the nest of hooded parrots so that larvae hatch in synchrony with the hatching of the parrot&#146;s eggs. The larvae spend their larval period in the nest and exclusively consume the excrement of the nestling parrots. When the parrot chicks fledge, the larvae move to the walls of the nest cavity to pupate, emerging the following wet season to repeat the process during the next parrot breeding season.
&#182;
With a description of the ecology of both species involved in the nesting symbiosis, chapter VI reviews the literature surrounding other interactions between nesting birds and invertebrates. A large number of birds are shown to nest in, or in close proximity to, structures made by invertebrates and avian nesting material provides a reliable shelter for many invertebrate species. However, the nature of such relationships has rarely been experimentally demonstrated. I propose that in order to understand the nature of these relationships they need to be explored within the theoretical framework of community ecology. Putative commensal and parasitic relationships have all been documented in the bird/invertebrate nesting literature, yet researchers, with few exceptions, repeatedly overlook the impact that these relationships are having on the invertebrate, at best assuming the nature of its impact, but more often ignoring its impact entirely. Here I present a framework for formulating hypotheses to ensure that the nature of the relationship can be identified. Only by explicitly stating the level of organisation at which the experiment is to occur (individual or population), identifying the net cost or benefit of the interaction, the range of conditions under which such costs or benefits would apply and the spatial and temporal context in which they apply, can an investigator expect to recognise and describe the often complex nature of these relationships. 
&#182;
While parasitic and commensal relationships between nesting birds and invertebrates are commonly reported, mutualisms between birds and invertebrates have not been reported. Despite this, candidates for this type of relationship exist. Chapter VII uses the framework outlined in the literature review (chapter VI) to experimentally examine the relationship between the hooded parrot and Trisyntopa neossophila. By manipulating the populations of moth larvae in a sample of hooded parrot nests, we sought to establish the impact of the relationship on each species. The moth depends on the parrot for provision of shelter and a reliable food source. The parrot however, was neither benefited nor harmed by the interaction in terms of short term reproductive output or chick growth, although differences between the experimental and control nests were noted. The relationship between the hooded parrot and T. neossophila, at least during the study period, is therefore concluded to be commensal.
&#182;
Collectively, the chapters of this thesis explore the complicated interactions between species. The dependence of the moth on the parrot and the parrot on the termite, demonstrate the importance of understanding interactions between species in a manner that reveals the impacts of the interactions, the range of conditions under which they would apply and the level of organisation at which they apply, as outlined in chapter VI. The dependence of the animals in this study on each other makes them more vulnerable to extinction than previously thought. Whilst this may not be immediately significant for the hooded parrot/T. neossophila system, which is thought to be secure, the ecologically similar system on the Cape York Peninsula, involving the golden-shouldered parrot and its nest attendant moth Trysintopa scatophaga, is vulnerable to extinction and subject to intensive management to ensure its persistence. This study brings new information to the management of the golden-shouldered parrots and urgently recommends increased protection for Trysintopa scatophaga.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hooded</field><field name="subject">parrot</field><field name="subject">psephotus</field><field name="subject">dissimilis</field><field name="subject">psittacidae</field><field name="subject">trisyntopa</field><field name="subject">neossophilla</field><field name="subject">scatophagy</field><field name="subject">termite</field><field name="subject">nest</field><field name="subject">breeding</field><field name="subject">lepidoptera</field><field name="subject">tropic</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090609.120032</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reasoning with Inconsistent Information</field><field name="creator">Wong, Paul</field><field name="description">In this thesis we are concerned with developing formal and representational mechanisms for reasoning with inconsistent information. Strictly speaking there are two conceptually distinct senses in which we are interested in reasoning with inconsistent information. In one sense, we are interested in using logical deduction to draw inferences in a symbolic system. More specifically, we are interested in mechanisms that can continue to perform deduction in a reasonable manner despite the threat of inconsistencies as a direct result of errors or misrepresentations. So in this sense we are interested in inconsistency-tolerant or paraconsistent deduction.
&#182;
However, not every case of inconsistent description is a case of misrepresentation. In many practical situations, logically inconsistent descriptions may be deployed as representations for problems that are inherently conflicting. The issue of error or misrepresentation is irrelevant in these cases. Rather the main concern in these cases is to provide meaningful analyses of the underlying structure and properties of our logical representation which in turn informs us about the salient features of the problem under consideration. So in this second sense, we are interested in deploying logic as a representation to model situations involving conflict.
&#182;
In this thesis we adopt a novel framework to unify both logic-as-deduction and logic-as-representation approaches to reasoning with inconsistent information. From a preservational view point, we take deduction as a process by which metalogical properties are preserved from premises to conclusions. Thus methodologically we may begin by identifying inconsistency-tolerant deduction mechanisms and then investigate what additional properties of inconsistent premises are preserved by these mechanisms; or alternatively we may begin by identifying properties of inconsistent logical descriptions and investigate which deductive mechanisms can preserve these properties.  We view these as two aspects of the same investigation. A key assumption in this work is that adequate analyses of inconsistencies require provisions to quantitatively measure and compare inconsistent logical representations. While paraconsistent logics have enjoyed considerable success in recent years, proper quantitative analysis of inconsistencies seems to have lapsed behind to some extent. In this thesis we&#146;ll explore different ways in which we can compare and measure inconsistencies. We hope to show that both inference and analysis can fruitfully be brought to bear on the issue of inconsistency handling under the same methodological scheme.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">logic</field><field name="subject">paraconsistency</field><field name="subject">inconsistent information</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090611.152017</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Zinc and nickel disrupt tubular vacuole and mitochondrial networks, but only nickel disrupts microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains</field><field name="creator">Tuszynska, Sandra, School of Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ectomycorrhizal fungi are able to ameliorate heavy metal stress to host trees in polluted soils. Their sensitivity or tolerance to heavy metals is usually examined based on growth and proliferation on heavy metal amended media. However, there are no data on cellular effects of heavy metals and detoxification in live cells of these fungi. Organelle morphology has recently been recognized as an indication of cellular health and its changes can be used to assess cytotoxicity. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate short term effects of common heavy metal pollutants, Zn2+ and Ni2+ on the morphology of vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules in hyphal tip cells of two Paxillus involutus strains. Vacuoles, mitochondria and microtubules were labeled with Oregon Green?? 488 carboxylic acid diacetate, 3,3'-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide ((DiOC6(3)) and anti-??- tubulin antibodies, respectively. They were treated with 0-1 mmol L-1 NiSO4 or 0-100 mmol L-1 ZnSO4 or K2SO4 (SO4 2- control) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Vacuoles and mitochondria in untreated hyphal tip cells of strain P2 which originated from a heavy metal-rich soil were motile and tubular forming networks. Exposure to the metals caused tubular vacuole thickening and vesiculation as well as fragmentation of tubular mitochondria in living hyphal tip cells. The highest K2SO4 concentration also had severe effects on mitochondria. These effects were metal, concentration and exposure time dependent. NiSO4 caused these effects at a hundred fold lower concentration than ZnSO4 and induced severe microtubule disruption. Vacuole tubularity recovered after removal of the metal solutions depending on the metal, concentration and exposure time. Mitochondrial tubularity recovered to pretreatment morphology in a shorter time and even during exposure to the highest metal concentration. Vacuoles of strain P46 which originated from a non-polluted soil were pleomorphic, but mainly spherical with occasional tubular interconnections. The vacuoles were too sensitive to UV light exposure required for fluorescence microscopy to investigate their response to heavy metals. The mitochondrial network and microtubules resembled those of strain P2. The highest ZnSO4 and NiSO4 concentrations caused similar trends in response of mitochondria and microtubules of the two strains. However, mitochondria of strain P46 were less sensitive at lower metal concentrations. The highest K2SO4 concentration had more severe effects on mitochondria of strain P46 than in strain P2 from which tubularity was not recovered. This investigation is the first to reveal that heavy metals affect organelle morphology in two strains of an ectomycorrhizal fungus. Nickel effects on the organelles are likely to result from microtubule disruption. Metal induced mitochondrial fragmentation is possibly an apoptotic response and the recovery of tubular organelle networks suggests cellular detoxification.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32728</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A telemedicine-based energy monitor for managing diabetes mellitus</field><field name="creator">Voon, Rudi, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin or in which the body has high insulin resistance thus making the regulation of blood glucose metabolism difficult. Currently, diabetes is still incurable. All patients need to well manage their blood glucose levels to reduce the risk of complications.  This dissertation is comprised of two major studies. In diabetes type I, the blood glucose can only be managed by multiple daily injection of insulin. However, most patients tend to have difficulty in deciding the right amount of insulin dose. The first study is the development of a mathematical model of blood glucose levels, which leads to the development of a decision support system for diabetes type I using the Markov theory.  In some type II and gestational diabetes, blood glucose can be managed by choosing diet properly and by exercising regularly. However, people tend to overestimate their activity levels. The second study describes the design and development of a wearable device based on the triaxial accelerometer that estimates the energy levels of normal daily physical activity with comparable accuracy to the gas analysis.  This device development leads to two clinical studies. The first clinical study investigates whether the energy monitor could help people with diabetes in promoting and managing their daily activity and help to improve the glycosylated haemoglobin and body mass index. The second clinical study investigates whether the energy monitor could help pregnant women with gestational diabetes in managing their daily activity, blood glucose levels and body weight gain.  This thesis also develops a telemedicine system to automate the data collection during the clinical trial period. The system would securely transmit all diabetes and energy data from the participants' home to a remote server.  A key finding of this study was that a higher activity score results in smaller fluctuations in blood glucose levels between measurements in both diabetes and gestational diabetes subjects. This suggests that higher activity levels would make the management of diabetes more effective by reducing the fluctuation in blood glucose levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy expenditure</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Markov model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41328</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite dimensional representability of forward rate and LIBOR models</field><field name="creator">Corr, Anthony, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines finite dimensional representability of Forward Rate and LIBOR models.

With the development of high Dk/t lens materials, overnight therapy has become the modality of choice for OK. Overnight OK lens wear has been previously investigated in terms of its efficacy to reduce myopia. However, the underlying effects of overnight OK lens wear on the human cornea have received less attention. As well as the clinical efficacy of overnight OK, this study investigated the effects of overnight OK on topographical corneal thickness and the overnight corneal edema response, and corneal tissue changes with overnight OK. Eighteen subjects participated as the OK lens-wearing group, wearing BE lenses (UltraVision, Brisbane, Queensland) in both eyes. A further ten subjects participated as control subjects, wearing conventional rigid lenses (J-Contour, UltraVision) in the right eye (RE) only. The left eye (LE) acted as a non-lens-wearing control. Both groups wore lenses overnight only, with no lens wear during the day. Measurements were conducted at baseline then on day 1, 4, 10, 30, 60, and 90 for the OK lens-wearing eyes; and up to day 30 for the control group, in the morning (after overnight lens wear) and in the evening (after 8-10 hours of lens removal). Variables measured included best vision sphere (BVS), unaided logMAR visual acuity (VA), refractive astigmatism, apical corneal power (ACP), simulated K readings (Medmont E300 corneal topographer), topographical corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer), and keratocyte and endothelial cell densities (ConfoScan2 confocal microscope).  Approximately 75% of myopia was corrected after the first night of OK lens wear and the changes in refractive error stabilised by day 10. By day 90, myopia reduction averaged 2.54 ?? 0.63 D. This was associated with significant improvement in unaided VA of about 82% after the first night of lens wear. There was no change in refractive astigmatism over the 3-month period. There was significant reduction in ACP in the OK lens-wearing eyes after the first night of lens wear, which accounted for more than 70% of the total ACP change over the 3-month period (RE: -2.16 ?? 0.53 D; LE: -2.11 ?? 0.86 D). There was significant central epithelial thinning (about 30%) and significant thickening (about 3%) in the mid-peripheral stroma in the OK lens-wearing eyes. Significant central epithelial thinning was found after the first night of lens wear while thickening in the mid-peripheral stroma reached statistical significance by day 4. Further analysis suggests that topographical corneal thickness changes account for the refractive error changes with overnight OK lens wear, rather than corneal bending. The central overnight stromal edema response was significantly reduced in the OK lens-wearing eyes (1.2 ?? 0.5%) to a level lower than in the conventional RGP (6.2 ?? 1.2%) and non-lens-wearing eyes (2.5 ?? 0.9%) in the control group. Mid-peripheral and peripheral stromal edema responses showed similar levels to those predicted based on lens Dk/t. A single overnight wear of BE and Paragon Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT) lenses showed that the edema response to BE lens wear is significantly less than in the CRT lens-wearing eyes (BE: 2.5 ?? 0.7%; CRT 3.5 ?? 1.3%) immediately on eye opening.  No significant changes were found in either central stromal keratocyte or endothelial cell densities in either OK or control groups over the study period. In conclusion, overnight OK lens wear induces significant reductions in myopia after the first night of lens wear associated with improvement in unaided VA. Overnight OK lens wear causes significant thinning in the central epithelium and significant mid-peripheral stromal thickening which results in flattening of the central cornea and steepening in the mid-periphery. Although there were no significant changes in central stromal keratocyte and endothelial cell densities, thinning of the central epithelial layer raises concerns regarding the safety of the procedure, especially with the alarming number of corneal infections reported recently in the literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthokeratology</field><field name="subject">myopia</field><field name="subject">corneal thickness</field><field name="subject">corneal curvature</field><field name="subject">contact lenses</field><field name="subject">cornea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22515</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of operating conditions on lifetime performance of membrane systems in whey processing</field><field name="creator">D???Souza, Nisha Maria, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Statistically designed experiments were conducted on a bench-scale ultrafiltration (UF) system using 10 kDa and 100 kDa polyethersulphone membranes to study the effect of operating conditions on membrane performance during whey processing. Experiments have underlined the importance of and provided a deeper understanding of factors influencing rejection. During filtration, a dynamic layer controlled protein fouling, reducing the effective molecular weight cut-off of the 100 kDa membrane and resulting in partial rejection. As pressure increases, the cake becomes denser allowing fewer and smaller passages for permeation, thereby increasing rejection of smaller solutes. Whey should be processed at high UF cross-flow velocities, relatively low transmembrane pressures, low feed concentrations and low temperatures. Low pressures help improve fractionation efficiency; high cross-flow velocities limit cake build-up and control cake thickness, thereby reducing specific cake resistance. Temperatures less than 10??C and pH values away from the protein iso-electric point inhibit bacterial growth and are compatible with protein, mineral and membrane stability. An existing model of dairy UF plants enabled determination of factors that affect membrane age and operational measures that minimise the effect of ageing. No significant effect of ageing was observed on performance at different volume concentration ratios (VCR). Operation at VCR 37 and 38 was capable of producing 80% whey protein concentrate (WPC). The effect of diafiltration water is improved when introduced over two loops with reallocation. Prevention of reallocation will dilute the total solids concentration in the retentate producing product that is out of specification. High protein rejections, lactose and ash rejection values between 5-15%, and non-protein nitrogen rejections below 50% are essential for producing 80% WPC. Fat rejection did not influence product quality although experimental studies show that fat concentration in liquid whey affects performance. Flux was the most influential measure of membrane life. Membrane elements in loops 11-12 did not require as frequent replacement compared to elements in loops 5-7 which are most susceptible to ageing. Emphasis should be placed on these elements for cleaning routines and operating conditions that minimise the effects of fouling in order to produce 80% WPC.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey</field><field name="subject">ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">membrances (technology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23309</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour Therapy In The Treatment Of Oral Behavioural Disorders</field><field name="creator">Howe, Evelyn L.

Each of these women grew up with a mother diagnosed 'mad' within the medical model. My subjective experiences are the beginning place of this re-search. Throughout my life with her, my mother was given a variety of diagnoses within the medical model. I wanted to know how other women lived the complexities of this particular mother-daughter relationship. The thesis foregrounds know-ledges and voices that are usually silenced. There is a growing body of work about women and 'madness', about the mothers' experiences, however there is little written that places the daughters in the centre of the text. Using critical social science paradigms and the tools of post-modernism and feminisms, the daughters' stories inter-rupt and dis-rupt the dominant discourses about famil(y)ies, mothering and mental illness. By foregrounding these know-ledges, I hope that some new ways of thinking about - of seeing - these lived discursive experiences will emerge. These stories also have much to say about life's journey. The thesis is about knowing the ledges we traveled along - or didn't. It is also about which know-ledges are heard and which are silenced, who speaks for what purpose - and in this, who and what are necessarily being shadowed. It is about the inter-ruptions and dis-ruptions in know-ledges. At the beginning of each chapter, I have highlighted some prominent inter-ruptions to the discourses within that chapter. I also signpost and begin a tentative discussion of the contribution of 'mad' mothers to post-modernism and feminisms. A contribution, which it seems to me, is not fully ac-know-ledged.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">mothers and daughters</field><field name="subject">psychology</field><field name="subject">women with social disabilities</field><field name="subject">minorities</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/20751</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The processing of pitch and temporal information in relational memory for melodies</field><field name="creator">Byron, Timothy P.</field><field name="description">A series of experiments investigate the roles of relational coding and expectancy in memory for melodies. The focus on memory for melodies was motivated by an argument that research on the evolutionary psychology of music cognition would be improved by further research in this area. Melody length and the use of transposition were identified in a literature review as experimental variables with the potential to shed light on the cognitive mechanisms in memory for melodies; similarly, pitch interval magnitude (PIM), melodic contour, metre, and pulse were identified as musical attributes that appear to be processed by memory for melodies. It was concluded that neither previous models of verbal short term memory (vSTM) nor previous models of memory for melodies are unable to satisfactorily explain current findings on memory for melodies. The model of relational memory for melodies that is developed here aims to explain findings from the memory for melodies literature. This model emphasises the relationship between: a) perceptual processes &#8211; specifically, a relational coding mechanism which encodes pitch and temporal information in a relational form; b) a short term store; and c) the redintegration of memory traces using schematic and veridical expectancies. The relational coding mechanism, which focuses on pitch and temporal accents (c.f., Jones, 1993), is assumed to be responsible for the salience of contour direction and note length, while the expectancy processes are assumed to be more responsible for the salience of increases in PIM or deviations from the temporal grid. Using a melody discrimination task, with key transposition within-pairs, in which melody length was manipulated, Experiments 1a, 1b, and 2 investigated the assumption that contour would be more reliant on the relational coding mechanism and PIM would be more reliant on expectancy processes. Experiment 1a confirmed this hypothesis using 8 and 16 note folk melodies. Experiment 1b used the same stimuli as Experiment 1a, except that the within-pair order was reversed in order to reduce the influence of expectancy processes. As expected, while contour was still salient under these conditions, PIM was not. Experiment 2 was similar to Experiment 1b, except that it avoided using the original melodies in same trials in order to specifically reduce the influence of veridical expectancy processes. This led to a floor effect. Overall, the results support the explanation of pitch processing in memory for melodies in the model. Experiments 3 and 4 investigated the assumption in the model that temporal processing in memory for melodies was reliant on the relational coding mechanism. Experiment 3 found that, with key transposition within-pairs, there was little difference between pulse alterations (which deviate more from the temporal grid) and metre alterations (which lengthen the note more) in short melodies, but that pulse alterations were more salient than metre alterations in long melodies. Experiment 4 showed that, with tempo transposition within-pairs, metre alterations were more salient than pulse alterations in short melodies, but that there was no difference in salience in long melodies. That metre alterations are more salient than pulse alterations in Experiment 4 strongly suggests that there is relational coding of temporal information, and that this relational coding uses note length to determine the presence of accents, as the model predicts. Experiments 5a and 5b, using a Garner interference task, transposition within-pairs, and manipulations of melody length, investigated the hypothesis derived from the model that pitch and temporal information would be integrated in the relational coding mechanism. Experiment 5b demonstrated an effect of Garner interference from pitch alterations on the discrimination of temporal alterations; Experiment 5a found a weaker effect of Garner interference from pitch alterations on the discrimination of temporal alterations. The presence of Garner interference in these tasks when there was transposition within melody pairs suggests that pitch and temporal information are integrated in the relational coding mechanism, as predicted in the model. Seven experiments therefore provide support for the assumption that a relational coding mechanism and LTM expectancies play a role in the discrimination of melodies. This has implications for other areas of research in music cognition. Firstly, theories of the evolution of music must be able to explain why features of these processing mechanisms could have evolved. Secondly, research into acquired amusia should have a greater focus on differences between perceptual, cognitive, and LTM processing. Thirdly, research into similarities between music processing and language processing would be improved by further research using PIM as a variable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music</field><field name="subject">psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">melody</field><field name="subject">musical pitch</field><field name="subject">musical perception</field><field name="subject">psychoacoustics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/37492</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural intentions in the motel industry : an empirical analysis</field><field name="creator">Ren, Min</field><field name="description">The New Zealand hospitality sector has become increasingly competitive in the past decade. The increase in competition has prompted motel management to focus on generating favourable customers&#8217; perceptions of their service as favourable perceptions encourage repeat purchase. Strategically, retaining existing customers and attracting new customers will be critical if motels are going to remain profitable in New Zealand&#8217;s competitive accommodation market.  There is a conceptual gap in the marketing literature as there has been very limited published research on service quality, value, customer satisfaction or behavioural intentions on the motel industry. This study seeks to fill this conceptual gap in the motel industry by identifying the dimensions of service quality, and empirically examining the interrelationships among the service quality dimensions, service quality, value, customer satisfaction, and behavioural intentions. The findings of this study are based on the analysis of a sample of 349 respondents who stayed at a full service New Zealand motel on Riccarton Road in Christchurch. Of the 600 questionnaires distributed, a total of 349 useable responses were returned resulting in a 58.2% useable response rate. Support was found for use of the primary dimensions: Interaction Quality, Physical Environment Quality, and Outcome Quality as broad dimensions of service quality in a hierarchical factor structure for motels. Ten sub-dimensions of service quality, as perceived by motel customers, were determined using focus group interviews and exploratory factor analysis. These ten sub-dimensions were: (1) Staff Professionalism, (2) Accuracy of Reservation, (3) Tangibles, (4) Cleanliness and Comfort, (5) Noise Level, (5) Parking, (7) Security, (8) Accuracy of Billing, (9) Location, and (10) Pleasant Stay. Support for the hypothesised paths between Service Quality, Value (price), Satisfaction, and Favourable Behavioural Intentions was confirmed. The results of the regression analysis make a contribution to the service marketing theory by providing an empirically based insight into the Service Quality construct in the motel industry. The study also provides a framework for understanding the effects of the three primary dimensions on Service Quality and how Service Quality affects Value (price), Satisfaction, and Favourable Behavioural Intentions. Value (price) was also empirically supported as an important predictor variable that has a moderating effect on the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">behavioural intentions</field><field name="subject">customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">value</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="subject">service quality dimensions</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">motel industry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measuring the health burden of hepatitis C at an individual and population level in Australia</field><field name="creator">Thein, Hla-Hla, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effect of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) to define burden of disease at individual and population levels. A systematic review of HCV HRQOL studies was undertaken with translation of Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey data into community-weighted health state utilities using three different methods. Derived estimates of health utilities were 0.87 for HCV treatment-induced sustained virological response (SVR); 0.81 for pre-cirrhosis; 0.76 for compensated cirrhosis; 0.69 for decompensated cirrhosis; 0.67 for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and 0.77 for liver transplant. The HCV health state utilities varied considerably from expert estimates, with relatively lower estimates for early liver disease and higher estimates for advanced liver disease, but were comparable to direct patient-elicited utilities. A study utilising data from population-based health surveys incorporating HCV screening among prisoners at Australian correctional centres in 1996 and 2001 showed no measurable effect of HCV on HRQOL, including that attributable to HCV viraemia. Compared to uninfected Australian norms, prisoners had lower HRQOL irrespective of HCV status. Several non-HCV factors such as age, co-morbidity, severity of depressive symptoms, and medical care utilization influenced HRQOL. A prospective study of health outcomes among HCV monoinfected and HIV/HCV coinfected individuals conducted at Sydney tertiary level hepatitis clinics between 2003 and 2005 found similar cognitive function, mood, and HRQOL patterns in these two HCV groups in the context of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2a and ribavirin therapy. The HCV groups had similar levels of pre-treatment HRQOL impairment, further on-treatment deterioration, and posttreatment improvements. SVR was associated with significant HRQOL improvements, but mental HRQOL improvement was also seen in individuals not achieving an SVR. The impact of HCV treatment uptake on HCV-related burden of disease at a population level in Australia was examined using a mathematical model. The model estimated that in 2004, there were ~181,500 cases of chronic HCV infection, 7,020 with HCV-related cirrhosis, and annual incidence of 238 cases of HCV-related liver failure and 70 cases of HCV-related HCC. Compared to no treatment, current treatment levels (~1% of HCV-infected individuals per annum) would reduce projected HCV-related cirrhosis and advanced liver disease numbers by ~30% at 2020 and a gain of ~122,200 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Even with a five-fold increase from current treatment levels, advanced liver disease numbers will continue to increase through 2020 but will be reduced by ~55% and a gain of ~483,200 QALYs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Epidemiology -- Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24967</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromelanin in human dopamine neurons</field><field name="creator">Fedorow, Heidi, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neuromelanin (NM) is a dark polymer pigment present in specific populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Interest in this pigment has rekindled in recent years because of a hypothesised link between NM and the especial vulnerability of NM-containing neurons to cell death in Parkinson???s disease (PD). Many aspects of the biology of NM are yet to be characterised. It is not known if NM like the similar melanin of the skin is synthesised via an enzymatic pathway or solely through autoxidation as has traditionally been thought. Examination of the ultrastructure of NM granules showed that in contrast to peripheral melanosomes, an electron-lucent lipid component was present that represented 30% of pigment volume. The identity of the lipid component of NM has remained unclear since it was first suggested that NM contained lipid in the 1960???s. NM lipid was biochemically isolated from the substantia nigra of 32 human brains. Using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometry and 1H- and 13C NMR techniques, it was shown for the first time that the NM lipid is the polyisoprenoid dolichol. The age-related development and regulation of NM has not previously been described. Optical density and area measurements of unstained NM in ventral substantia nigra neurons spanning the ages of 24 weeks to 95 years old demonstrated three developmental phases. NM was not present at birth and initiation of pigmentation began at approximately 3 years of age, followed by a period of increasing pigment granule number and colouration until age 20. In PD brain, the ultrastructure of NM demonstrated that the amount of lipid did not change. However, filipin staining showed a reduction of cholesterol in PD NM containing neurons. In addition, immunogold staining of ??-synuclein demonstrated that this protein redistributed to the NM lipid in PD brain. The finding of phases in the development of NM, and the identification of lipid species in NM suggest that NM biology is regulated. This thesis has also demonstrated changes in the lipid and associated proteins in PD, suggesting NM???s chemical composition alters which may have functional consequences that contribute to PD.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32717</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteolytic enzymes in grass pollen and their relationship to allergenic proteins</field><field name="creator">Saldanha, Rohit Gregory, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pollen grains are ubiquitous triggers of allergic asthma and seasonal rhinitis. Proteolytic enzymes in pollen as well as other sources are capable of disrupting airway epithelial integrity in vivo and in vitro. This provides a plausible mechanism for the initiation of sensitisation of the respiratory immune system to inhaled pollen allergens, comparable to that suggested for Group 1 allergens from house dust mites and cat dander, which are known to possess intrinsic proteolytic activity. This thesis explores the relationship between pollen allergens and proteolytic enzymes. It describes the different strategies used for the characterisation, purification and identification of immunogenic and proteolytic proteins in the complex mixtures of pollen diffusates. The peptidases in the diffusates of Kentucky blue grass, ryegrass and Bermuda grass pollens were characterised by a sensitive fluorescence assay and gelatin zymography. Among these, Bermuda grass pollen demonstrated the presence of a serine peptidase at Mr ~30,000 Da, which corresponded to an intense band by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to the timothy grass (Phleum pratense) group 1 allergen, Phl p 1. Purification of this enzyme from Bermuda grass was complicated by the low levels of the enzyme present in the diffusate, as well as by its autohydrolysis. Partial purification of the serine peptidase activity by affinity chromatography using Concanavalin A Sepharose demonstrated that the diffusate contained a trypsin-like peptidase, detected by the fluorescent assay, in addition to the ~30,000 Da serine endopeptidase, detected on gelatin zymography. Proteomic analysis of the ~30,000 Da protein using one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified it as the major pollen allergen of Bermuda grass, Cyn d 1. The studies reported here provide, for the first time, evidence that a pollen allergen may possess intrinsic proteolytic activity. This activity may play a role in the initiation of airway inflammation and allergic sensitisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteolytic enzymes</field><field name="subject">Allergens</field><field name="subject">Pollen.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20824</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment experience and HIV disease progression: findings from the Australian HIV observational database</field><field name="creator">Petoumenos, Kathy, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) is a collaboration of hospitals, sexual health clinics and specialist general practices throughout Australia, established in April 1999. Core data variables collected include demographic data, immunological and virological markers, AIDS diagnosis, antiretroviral and prophylactic treatment and cause of death. The first electronic data transfer occurred in September 1999 followed by six monthly data transfers thereafter. All analyses included in this thesis are based on patients recruited to AHOD by March 2004. By March 2004, 2329 patients had been recruited to AHOD from 27 sites throughout Australia. Of these, 352 (15%) patients were recruited from non-metropolitan clinics. The majority of patients were male (94%), and infected with HIV through male homosexual contact (73%). Almost 90% of AHOD patients are antiretroviral treatment experience, and the majority of patients are receiving triple therapy as mandated by standard of care guidelines in Australia. Antiretroviral treatment use has changed in Australia reflecting changes in the availability of new treatment strategies and agents. The crude mortality rate was 1.58 per 100 person years, and of the 105 deaths, more than half died from HIV-unrelated deaths. The prevalence of HBV and HCV in AHOD was 4.8% and 10.9%, respectively. HIV disease progression in the era of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) among AHOD patients is consistent with what has been reported in developed countries. Common factors associated with HIV disease progression were low CD4 cell count, high viral load and prior treatment with mono or double therapy at the time of commencing HAART. This was demonstrated in AHOD in terms of long-term CD4 cell response, the rate of changing combination antiretroviral therapy and factors predicting death. HBV and HCV coinfection is also relatively common in AHOD, similar to other developed country cohorts. Coinfection does not appear to be serious impediments to the treatment of HIV infected patients. However, HIV disease outcome following HAART does appear to be adversely affected by HIV/HCV coinfection but not in terms of HIV/HBV coinfection. Patients attending non-metropolitan sites were found to be similar to those attending metropolitan sites in terms of both immunological response and survival.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) - Australia - Epidemiology - Treatment</field><field name="subject">HIV infections - Australia - Epidemiology - Treatment</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) - Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">HIV infections - Pathogenesis</field><field name="subject">HIV infections - Australia - Statistics - Databases</field><field name="subject">AIDS (Disease) - Australia - Statistics - Databases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24937</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of student pathways during information-seeking sessions using hypermedia programs : a social semiotic perspective</field><field name="creator">Zammit, Katina</field><field name="description">The thesis extends the use of systemic functional linguistics (SFL) to describe and analyse the semiotic systems beyond language by providing a detailed and systematic approach to the description of multimodal hypertext systems.

To decrease costs and avoid undue pressure on the global food supply, the renewable lignocelluloses appear to be a better substrate for bioethanol production compared to others being investigated. This study investigated the conversion of lignocellulosic material, sugarcane bagasse, to ethanol by the use of Zymomonas mobilis and Pichia stipitis. The investigation of fermentation characteristics of the two strains revealed that their performance on the ethanol production was closely related to the viable cell concentration in the medium. The increase of inoculum size to five fold resulted in an increase in the system co-efficiency to 2.2 fold and 5.2 fold respectively for Z. mobilis and P. stipitis. A theoretical value de (the cell instantaneous ethanol production rate) was introduced to describe the ethanol productivity based on biomass. System co-efficiency proved to be only affected by the viable cell concentration (xC) and de, regardless of ethanol re-assimilation. Immobilized culture of Z. mobilis and P. stipitis showed distinct differences in their characteristics. The bacterium acclimatized to the interior of gel beads; the biomass concentration within the beads increased greater than 10 fold during the reuse of the beads, resulting in an improved fermentation performance. The immobilized P. stipitis gave a similar system co-efficiency level of approximately 0.5 g/l/h under different culture conditions; cell growth in the medium was considerably more vigorous compared to that within the beads. P. stipitis sole-culture on the glucose/xylose medium with a high inoculum size showed a comparable fermentation efficiency with the best result of the co-culture processes. Fermentation of 50.0 g/l of sugar mixture (30.0 g/l glucose and 20.0 g/l xylose) was completed in 20 h with an ethanol yield of 0.44 g/g. No catabolite repression due to glucose was observed for the xylose assimilation. Co-culture of immobilized Z. mobilis and free cells of P. stipitis proved to be the best fermentation scheme on the glucose/xylose sugar mixture co-fermentation. The removal of Z. mobilis after the utilization of glucose improved the stability of the performance. The best result showed that 50.0 g/l sugars were fully converted to ethanol within 19 h, giving an ethanol yield of 0.49 g/g, which is 96% of the theoretical rate. When co-cultured, viable cells of Z. mobilis inhibited the cell activity of P. stipitis, and were capable of growing to high concentration levels without an appropriate carbon source. Acid and enzymatic hydrolysates of sugarcane bagasse showed similar fermentability, but the hydrolysate without overliming significantly inhibited both cell growth and ethanol production of P. stipitis. The co-culture process on the hydrolysate medium successfully utilized 53.56 g/l sugars (32.14 g/l glucose and 21.42 g/l xylose) in 26 h with a yield of 0.43 g/g; this value further increased to 0.49 g/g when ethanol peaked at 40 h. A high cell density proved to be an effective method to improve the system co-efficiency for ethanol production. For the fermentation processes on the sugar medium, results achieved in this study, 10.54 g/l/h for Z. mobilis free cell culture on glucose, 0.755 g/l/h for P. stipitis free cell culture on xylose, 1.092 g/l/h for P. stipites free cell culture on the glucose/xylose mixture and 1.277 g/l/h for glucose/xylose co-fermentation using co-culture, are higher than the best values reported in the literature in batch culture. In the fermentation of the hydrolysate, the system co-efficiency of 0.879 g/l/h achieved with co-culture is comparable to the best values reported for the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sugarcane products</field><field name="subject">biomass energy</field><field name="subject">alcohol as fuel</field><field name="subject">bagasse</field><field name="subject">zymomonas mobilis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/38682</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEGREES OF CHEATING:
AN EXPLORATION OF STUDENT ACADEMIC DISHONESTY IN
AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES</field><field name="creator">Marsden, Helen</field><field name="description">It can be argued that perceptions of the quality of the nation's universities are
fundamental to Australia's economy. At a time when universities are competing more and more in a global marketplace, reputation is a key factor in attracting students, and therefore funding. When reputations are called into question, the sustainability of institutions becomes uncertain.
Scandals surrounding academic dishonesty in Australia have not been uncommon in recent years. In response, universities have demonstrated an increasing awareness of the problem and a move toward updating or instigating policies to deal with it. However, the evidence base for such policy development is scant. Outside the USA, there have been few studies of academic dishonesty and virtually no large-scale, multi-campus research.
The present research was designed to provide such an evidence base. Three studies were conducted to explore the extent and nature of dishonest academic behaviour, together with an investigation of factors which might precipitate students' engagement in these activities. In addition to variables which had previously been shown to be related to cheating, it was theorised that factors identified by General Strain Theory as being related to delinquency and general deviance, may also be associated with student cheating.
A large-scale multi-campus survey was conducted (N= 9543; 11 universities). Findings were analysed to assess the extent of cheating amongst students and identify factors
which contribute to these behaviours. Two qualitative studies followed which were designed to tap the experiences of, and understandings about, academic dishonesty of both staff and students. Overall the research established that levels of dishonest academic behaviours by the students in this study, while still worryingly high, are somewhat lower than those reported in the international literature. A number of risk factors for student engagement in dishonest behaviour were identified. Chief amongst these were the experience of stressful life events and the presence of dishonest peers. To a lesser, but still significant extent, were factors related to student age, year of enrolment, and field of study. Implications for addressing the problem at the level of policy development and strategic response are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">college</field><field name="subject">university</field><field name="subject">student conduct</field><field name="subject">cheating</field><field name="subject">academic dishonesty</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20090617.112944</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of simple physiological growth models to coastal eucalypt regrowth forests in New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Dore, David William, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences (BEES), UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores issues relating to the application of physiological-process models (???process models???) of forest growth to mixed species, mixed age forests, in particular the coastal blackbutt forests of New South Wales.  Using a dataset provided by State Forests of New South Wales (Carter 1994 unpubl.) a numeric description of the forest was developed and stand-level parameters of interest were derived, in particular the plot by plot stemwood volume growth from 1975 to 1999.  The amounts of harvested volume, volume that died and volume that grew into the measurement population were identified separately, and several different means of accounting for volume change over time were investigated. A method for quantifying the impact of harvesting and other silvicultural practices on the growth of the forest was developed and programs were written to convert the stand-level summary of the harvest impact into a semi-random selection of trees that would be ???harvested??? from the database under the set of silvicultural assumptions (Dore et al. 1999).  A number of process models were investigated and reviewed before selecting one particular model, SUSTAIN (Dewar 1997) for adaption to these forests.  This model is a relatively simple process model with a small number of input parameters.  The model was adapted so that it could be used to compare the SUSTAIN estimate of growth with the growth of an individual stand of trees in the Kendall Forest Management Area, between Wauchope and Taree on the mid-north coast of NSW.  To improve the accuracy of the prediction of growth by SUSTAIN, a method of re-setting the state of the stand to the actual condition at the time of remeasurement was developed.  In addition, the SUSTAIN model was extended to enable two separate levels of canopy to be described and grown separately. Ultimately the model was only partially successful in mirroring the growth predicted by the empirical data.  Its partial success is attributed primarily to the difficulties associated with correctly determining the allocation parameters used by the model to assign net photosynthate to the roots, foliage and stemwood.  The nature of the change in allocation parameters when the forest stand is disturbed by harvest or fire needs further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest plants -- Australia -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of retinoic acid signalling in pancreatic cancer</field><field name="creator">Segara, Davendra, St Vincents Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in Western societies. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular pathology of PC and its precursor lesion: pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), there remain no molecules with proven clinical utility. Affymetrix Genechipfi oligonucleotide microarrays were used to interrogate mRNA expression of PC and normal pancreas to identify molecular pathways dysregulated in PC. Analysis of these data identified altered expression of numerous components of the S100 Calcium Binding Protein Family, Retinoic Acid signalling pathway and the HOX transcriptional network in PC compared to normal pancreas. These pathways were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ hybridisation (ISH) in a cohort of patients with PC. Increased protein expression, of S100A2, S100A6 and S100P was observed in 43%, 60% and 48% of PC respectively. Expression of S100A2 was associated with a poor outcome (p = 0.009), whilst increased expression of S100A6 (p = 0.0008) and S100P (p = 0.0005) were associated with an improved outcome. Additionally, S100A2 expression was identified as an independent marker of outcome in resected tumours. Aberrant expression of retinoic acid signalling components was demonstrated in PC cell lines using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. ISH demonstrated expression of Retinoic Acid Induced 3 (RAI3), an orphan G protein coupled receptor normally expressed in the fetal lung, in 68% of PC, and this co-segregated with an improved overall survival (p = 0.026).Ectopic protein expression of HOXB2, a transcription factor normally expressed in the developing hindbrain and modulated by retinoic acid, was observed in 15% of early PanIN lesions and 38% of PC specimens. Expression of HOXB2 was associated with non-resectable tumours and was an independent predictor of poor survival in resected tumours. Suppression of HOXB2 protein expression using small interfering RNA, resulted in epithelioid trans-differentiation in the Panc-1 PC cell line, however no alteration in proliferation rates were observed compared to controls. This thesis has shown that transcript profiling and tissue validation has identified potential markers of early diagnosis and outcome in PC. Furthermore, pathways and molecules previously thought to be associated with normal human development have been implicated to play a role in the development and progression of PC. Further analyses of these markers will determine any potential role in future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system -- Cancer</field><field name="subject">Digestive organs -- Diseases</field><field name="subject">Pancreas -- Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26269</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient estimation in portfolio management</field><field name="creator">Kouch, Richard, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates whether estimating the inputs of the Markowitz (1952) Mean- Variance framework using various econometric techniques leads to improved optimal portfolio allocations at the country, sector and stock levels over a number of time periods.

The benefits of reducing dust levels will be a lesser risk of lung disease to coal miners, improved working conditions and a reduced risk of dust explosions. Coal dust is commonly suppressed by water sprays but suppression efficiency is not high because dust tends to travel in the air flow round the water droplets rather than being captured by them. If water sprays are electrostatically charged, then a significant improvement in dust suppression efficiency may be achieved. Of the three principal droplet charging mechanisms, i.e. corona charging, induction charging and contact charging, corona charging is the most widely used in many industrial fields including dust suppression, However, it requires a high applied voltage, ranging from thousands to more than a hundred thousand volts, depending on the geometry of the charging equipment. Induction charging has been used in agricultural spraying since Law (1978) developed an embedded-electrode induction charging spraying nozzle. This nozzle provides a compact, inexpensively fabricated droplet charger and, reduces design requirements on size and output voltage (of the order of 1000 volts). It also reduces the potential for mechanical damage, misalignment and personnel hazard. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of dust suppression, either the charge on individual droplets or the charge-to-mass ratio of water sprays needs to be known. However, the parameters which control the charge applied to water and the charging rate have been unsolved theoretically for any charging mechanism. The existing theories for the induction-charged and air-atomising a liquid jet have been found to be inadequate. And there is no theory available for corona charging of the droplets produced with a pneumatic nozzle in order to predict the spray charge level or the spray charge-to-mass ratio. In view of this situation, mathematical models have been developed in this thesis for both the corona and induction charging mechanisms. During the development of the theories, it has been assumed that for corona charging, that the jet is disintegrated into droplets and the droplets are then charged; for induction charging, that the jet is first charged and the charged jet is then disintegrated into charged droplets. The Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D32 , plays an important role in linking the individual droplet charge to the spray charge-to-mass ratio for both charging mechanisms. The developed theories are general models suitable for any liquid with both corona and induction charging. Theoretical calculations for the spray charge-to-mass ratio, individual droplet charge and the ratio of droplet charge to the Rayleigh charge limit have been presented for almost all of the influencing electrical and mechanical parameters such as applied voltage, air flowrate, liquid flowrate, liquid conductivity, liquid dielectric constant, nozzle dimensions, cylindrical electrode dimensions, and fluid parameters, for example, density, viscosity and surface tension. In the calculation for corona charging of droplets, the effect of the droplets on corona current and corona-onset voltage has been assessed for first time. The introduction of the Sauter mean diameter of the sprays, D32 , makes the assessment possible. Theoretical calculations for induction charging of liquid jets have shown that provided liquids have a conductivity value higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m, then they can be charged satisfactorily by the induction charging method. Among all of the influencing parameters, the electrical and mechanical parameters determine the charging rate and the water spray charge level. The suitability of employing these two charging mechanisms to dust suppression in coal mine has been evaluated based on the spray charge level, safety issues and the simplicity or otherwise of the equipment. The induction charging method was considered to have advantages over its corona charging counterpart, and has been chosen for charging the water sprays in the experiment program. Water has a conductivity of s = - 10 2 S/m, higher than the critical value, s = - 10 4 S/m. Based upon theoretical considerations, it is concluded that water is an appropriate liquid for corona charging, based on its dielectric constant, and for induction charging, based on its conductivity. In order to facilitate the testing of electrostatically charged water spray cloud parameters, a spray charger/collector was designed and constructed by others and a computerised data acquisition system has been employed. According to the theory developed for induction charging, the optimum length of the charging electrode has been analysed based upon the assumption that water jet is first charged and then the charged jet is disintegrated into charged droplets by the high pressure air. An experimental program examined the dependence of spray current upon four parameters: air flowrate, water flowrate, applied voltage and jet diameter. The experiments have shown that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle used in the experiment is able to impart a significant charge into the water sprays. The spray charge-to-mass ratio calculated based upon the measured spray current demonstrates the same characteristics as predicted by theory: increasing with air flowrate, decreasing with water flowrate, increasing with applied voltage to a peak value then decreasing with further increase in the voltage, and increasing with jet diameter. A successful interpretation of an important phenomenon in the inductioncharged air-atomising a water jet, that spray charge-to-mass ratio and spray current increase with air pressure (or air flowrate) and decrease with increasing water flowrate, has been achieved based on the theories developed in this thesis. This phenomenon occurs because increasing air flowrate and/or decreasing water flowrate leads to a higher velocity of jet flowing through the induction electrode. However, when water flowrate becomes very small, a decrease in spray current with increasing air pressure (or flowrate) may be caused both by jet breakup inside the electrode and by contraction of the jet. In order to verify the theory, a preliminary comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions employing a constant kic in the air-jet interaction coefficient a which was assumed to be 0.7 has shown a general agreement. However, the value of kic appears to be related to jet diameter, air/water mass ratio and applied voltage. An empirical equation for kic has then been formulated based on the experimental data for the spray charge-to-mass ratio. Finally a comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions using the formulated kic shows an improved agreement. It is concluded that the induction-charged air-atomising nozzle has a potential application in dust suppression in coal mines, as the voltage required to charge water sprays is only 1000 ~ 1200 volts, and that the theory developed for induction charging of water sprays can be used to guide laboratory investigations and design processes for dust suppression and other industrial applications which might employ the electrostatic charging of liquid sprays.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrostatic induction</field><field name="subject">Corona (Electricity)</field><field name="subject">Spray nozzles</field><field name="subject">Mineral industries -- Dust control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27410</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A socio-cognitive model for learning in art museums: establishing a foundation for cultural practice in the secondary school years</field><field name="creator">Mathewson, Donna, School of Art Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This doctoral investigation examines educational relationships between museums and schools, and more specifically between art museums and secondary art education. The author's analysis of literature pertaining to museum/school relationships and previous research conducted within Honours research establishes systematic contradictions as permeating the public role of museums and educational engagements with museums. In seeking explanation, a theoretical framework, derived from the social theories of Pierre Bourdieu is developed. The framework is used to interrogate the practices of school-based art education and art museums, and the agents involved, to examine how social relations operate to enable and constrain the representation and engagement of secondary school-based perspectives in the museum setting. Aspects that have previously remained unacknowledged are examined to reveal the interplay of factors that influence educational experiences in the art museum setting. Using the findings from the first stage of the analysis, in concert with the Bourdieuan framework, the author develops a model for learning in art museums that explores and articulates a new pedagogical terrain in the art educational use of art museums. A socio-cognitive framework is developed to reflect the strategic incorporation of museological knowledge, contemporary art education philosophies and practices and sociological theory. The aims of the model are to engage secondary art education and art museums using a sociological perspective, provide the tools for secondary art educators to be autonomous in the art museum setting, recognize that individuals relate to cultural materials and experiences in varying and multiple ways and develop educational encounters that predispose learners to engage in the cultural practice of art museum visiting. In intrinsically valuing art museum experiences as distinctive learning opportunities, the model provides teaching and learning strategies that allow for a multi-faceted, developmentally appropriate and cognitively based educational involvement. As the ultimate outcome of the research the model has significance for secondary art students, secondary art educators, teacher educators and art museum educators. It is unique in providing a secondary school-based art educational perspective on learning in art museums that is designed to establish a foundation for cultural practice, within and beyond the school years.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art museums - Educational aspects</field><field name="subject">Museums and schools</field><field name="subject">Museums -- Educational aspects</field><field name="subject">Art -- Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu, Pierre</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27295</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An airborne Lidar canopy segmentation approach for estimating above-ground biomass in coastal eucalypt forests</field><field name="creator">Turner, Russell Sean, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is growing interest in airborne lidar for forest carbon accounting and precision forestry purposes. Airborne lidar systems offer a cost-effective, versatile, operationally flexible and robust sampling tool for forest managers. The objective of this study was to develop and test lidar canopy surface enhancement and segmentation processes for estimating dominant above-ground biomass (DAB) in a harvested eucalypt forest on the Central Coast of New South Wales (Australia). The Crown Infill, Trim and Smooth (CITS) process, incorporating a series of filters, algorithms, and selective multi-stage smoothing, was used to enhance lidar canopy surfaces prior to segmentation. Canopy segmentation was achieved using a vertical crown template approach termed the Spatially and Morphologically Isolated Crest (SMIC) process. SMIC delineates dominant tree crowns by detecting elevated crown crests within a 3D lidar canopy surface. Consolidated crown units constitute the basic sampling, analysis and reporting units for wall-to-wall forest inventory. The performance, sensitivity and limitations of these procedures were evaluated using a combination of simulated forest models and actual lidar forest data. Automated crown polygons were used as a sampling template to extract dominant tree height values which were converted to DAB estimates via height-to-biomass relationships derived from field survey and on-site destructive sampling. Results were compared with field based tree height and biomass estimates. Compared against a manually derived crown map from a 2ha field plot, canopy segmentation results revealed a producer???s accuracy of 76% and overall accuracy of 67%. Results indicated a trend toward greater crown splitting (fragmentation) as trees increase in age, height, stem diameter and crown size. Extracted dominant tree height values were highly correlated with ground survey height estimates (r2 0.95 for precision survey and r2 0.69 for standard survey). There was also no significant difference between SMIC and manual crown height estimates. SMIC units overestimated ground-based DAB by 5%; this increased to 36% with the inclusion of segmentation errors. However, SMIC estimation of total plot above-ground biomass (AGB) was within 9% of the ground-based estimate. Results are encouraging considering the mixed-species, multi-aged composition of the forest, and the combined effects of SMIC segmentation and lidar height errors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest ecology -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest biomass</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of seed drying using a two-stage drying concept</field><field name="creator">Jittanit, Weerachet, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effect of drying corn, rice and wheat seed in two stages was studied, using germinability as a measure of quality. For the first stage, fluidised bed dryer (FBD) and spouted bed dryer (SBD) were used to dry seed from 20-25%wb to 18%wb while in-store dryer (ISO) was used in the second stage for drying from 18%wb to below 14%wb. The drying air temperature range of 40-80??C was studied for the first stage while 18-30??C and relative humidity 60-70% were for the second stage. It was found that dryer type, drying temperature, initial moisture content of seeds and drying time had significant effects on the seed germination. From the result, the drying air temperature of 40??C was safe for corn and rice in FBD while 60??C was acceptable for wheat. In SBD, the 40??C was the maximum drying temperature for rice and wheat without quality deterioration. Meanwhile the second stage drying in an ISD under all specified conditions was safe.  In this work, the thin-layer drying models were developed. The results showed that the modified Page's model and modified two-compartment model were the best-fitted models with the root mean square (RMS) of the differences between the predicted moisture ratio and the measured values below 0.03. Besides, the existing ISD simulation program provided the RMS of 0.3, 1.1, and 0.9%wb for corn, rice and wheat respectively. The germination models for FBD and SBD were also developed. As a result, the modified Giner's models 1&amp;2 were the best-fitted models for FBD with the RMS of the differences between predicted and measured germination percentages of 7.9, 4.2 and 3.4% for corn, rice and wheat while the modified Giner's models 2&amp;3 were for SBD with the RMS of 5.5 and 6.1% for rice and wheat respectively.  The comparison between FBD and SBD revealed that FBD had faster drying rate while SBD consumed less energy. Ultimately, the energy cost analysis showed that single-stage drying in a fixed bed dryer using ambient condition consumed less energy than two-stage drying using a FBD and ISD but lower energy cost must be weighed against the faster drying rate, flexibility, portable design, and product uniformity of FBD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corn -- Seeds -- Drying.</field><field name="subject">Wheat -- Seeds -- Drying.</field><field name="subject">Rice -- Seeds -- Drying.</field><field name="subject">Seeds -- Drying -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Germination.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40679</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reporting intangible assets: voluntary disclosure practices of the top emerging market companies</field><field name="creator">Kang, Helen Hyon Ju, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of financial reporting is to provide information that is useful for decision making. Recently, however, there has been a systematic decline in the usefulness of such information. Indeed, the current reporting model seems to be no longer sufficient mainly due to the fact that it ignores many of the nonfinancial intangible factors which are increasingly becoming important in determining corporate value and performance. That is, there is a need for the traditional reporting model to be modified or at least broadened to reflect Intangible Assets (IA) in order to enhance the usefulness of information being provided to different stakeholders. In the absence of mandatory reporting requirements, one alternative way of disseminating information regarding IA is to engage in voluntary disclosure practices. It has also been suggested that companies which would benefit the most from such practice are those originating from emerging economies looking to expand into international markets. While there exists an array of empirical studies which have examined the voluntary disclosure practices of corporations from developed economies, less considered are the reporting practices of emerging market companies regarding their IA. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the voluntary disclosure practices of the top 200 emerging market companies regarding the variety, nature and extent of IA and to consider some of the factors that may be associated with the level of such disclosure. Using a disclosure index based on the Value Chain Scoreboard??? (Lev, 2001), narrative sections of the 2002 annual reports of the top 200 emerging market companies are analysed. The findings indicate that emerging market companies engage in voluntary disclosure practices in order to disseminate different varieties of mainly quantitative IA information to their global stakeholders. Further, the variety and the extent of IA disclosure are associated with corporate specific factors such as leverage, adoption of IFRS/US GAAP, industry type, and price to book ratio. Contrary to the existing literature on voluntary disclosure, however, firm size and ownership concentration are not found to be associated with the IA disclosure level. Country specific factors such as the level of risks associated with economic policy and legal system are also found to be significantly associated with the IA voluntary disclosure level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intangible property -- accounting; corporation reports; financial statements; corporations -- valuation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31211</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new evolutionary optimisation method for the operation of power systems with multiple storage resources</field><field name="creator">Thai, Cau Doan Hoang, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Advanced technologies, a world-wide trend to deregulation of power systems and environmental constraints have attracted increasing interest in the operation of electric power systems with multiple storage resources. Under the competitive pressure of the deregulation, new efficient solution techniques to adapt quickly to the changing marketplace are in demand. This thesis presents a new evolutionary method, Constructive Evolutionary Programming (CEP), for minimising the system operational cost of scheduling electric power systems with multiple storage resources. The method combines the advantages of Constructive Dynamic Programming and Evolutionary Programming. Instead of evolving the "primal" variables such as storage content releases and thermal generator outputs, CEP evolves the piecewise linear convex cost-to-go functions (i.e. the storage content value curves). The multi-stage problem of multi-storage power system scheduling is thus decomposed into many smaller one-stage subproblems with evolved cost-to-go functions. For each evolutionary individual, linear programming is used in the forward pass process to solve the dispatch subproblems and the total system operational cost over the scheduling period is assigned to its fitness. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and efficient for multi-storage power systems, particularly large complex hydrothermal system with cascaded and pumped storages. Although the proposed method is in the early stage of development, relying on assumptions of piecewise linear convexity in a deterministic environment, methods for the incorporation of stochastic models, electrical network and nonlinear, non-convex and non-smooth models are discussed. In addition, a number of possible improvements are also outlined. Due to its simplicity but robustness and efficiency, there are potential research directions for the further development of this evolutionary optimisation method.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary programming Computer science</field><field name="subject">Dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17603</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutions, education inequality and dynamics of institutional reform</field><field name="creator">Najeeb, Khaqan Hassan, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of four studies on the role of institutions, education and institutional reform in economic development. Three of the studies examine empirical aspects of the issue and the fourth provides an analysis of policy implications. A key theme of the dissertation is the recognition that institutions, both formal and informal, are important for development. The observation that some developing economies have been unable to substantively improve institutional structures, creates a vital agenda for studying institutional change. The first study empirically investigates the impact of education, both quantitatively and qualitatively, on the informal institution of social capital measured as social trust. Differences in levels of education are considered to find the separate effects of primary, secondary and tertiary education. The relationship between education and social trust levels in countries is found to be positive. The sample is further split into developed and developing countries which also substantiates the main hypothesis. The results can be interpreted as schooling playing a transformative role in the society. The second study develops a framework for studying education inequality and institutional development. A range of economic, political and social measures of institutional quality are used in a cross-country analysis. The study confirms that the cross-country differences in institutional variables are influenced negatively by the education inequality. Several competing hypotheses of institutional improvement are used to test the sensitivity of the results. The sample is further split into OECD and non-OECD countries, with no new results arising from this split. The third study investigates the relationship of education inequality and institutional quality using panel data techniques and an alternative data set of institutional measures, than the one used in the second study. This study initially estimates the relationship using the pooled OLS and fixed effects models. The issue of persistency in institutional variables is then investigated by using a system GMM estimator. The evidence suggests that the impact of reducing education inequality is associated with improvements in institutional quality. The fourth study analyses the implications from the first three studies with reference to the institutional reform agenda. Insight is given for improving the reform process. Areas of context specificity and sequencing of reforms are dealt with, using country examples. The intuition from this essay is that educational equality is a deliberate initiative which needs to be carried out through policy initiatives, although the process adopted would depend on the specific economy. It is suggested that there is a need to change the fundamental focus from emphasis on altering formal rules, to considering the current underlying structures in societies as a constraint, in developing a way forward to improving the reform agenda.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Institutions</field><field name="subject">Education inequality</field><field name="subject">Reform</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43523</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing variations in the fundamental constants with quasar absorption lines</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Michael T., Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Precision cosmology challenges many aspects of fundamental physics. In particular, quasar absorption lines test the assumed constancy of fundamental constants over cosmological time-scales and distances. Until recently, the most reliable technique was the alkali doublet (AD) method where the measured doublet separation probes variations in the fine-structure constant, ???? e2/??c. However, the recently introduced many-multiplet (MM) method provides several advantages, including a demonstrated ???10-fold precision gain. This thesis presents detailed MM analyses of 3 independent Keck/HIRES samples containing 128 absorption systems with 0.2 &amp;gt zabs &amp;gt 3.7. We find 5.6 ?? statistical evidence for a smaller ?? in the absorption clouds: ????/?? = (-0.574 ?? 0.102) x 10-5. All three samples separately yield consistent, significant ????/??. The data marginally prefer constant d??/dt rather than constant ????/??. The two-point correlation function for ?? and the angular distribution of ????/?? give no evidence for spatial variations. We also analyse 21 Keck/HIRES Si iv doublets, obtaining a 3-fold relative precision gain over previous AD studies: ????/?? = (-0.5 ?? 1.3) x 10-5 for 2.0 &amp;gt zabs &amp;gt 3.1. Our statistical evidence for varying ?? requires careful consideration of systematic errors. Modelling demonstrates that atmospheric dispersion is potentially important. However, the quasar spectra suggest a negligible effect on ????/??. Cosmological variation in Mg isotopic abundances may affect ????/?? at zabs &amp;gt 1.8. Galactic observations and theory suggest diminished 25;26Mg abundances in the low metallicity quasar absorbers. Removing 25;26Mg isotopes yields more negative ????/?? values. Overall, known systematic errors can not explain our results. We also constrain variations in y ?? ?? 2gp, comparing H i 21-cm and millimetrewave molecular absorption in 2 systems. Fitting both the H i and molecular lines yields the tightest, most reliable current constraints: ??y/y = (-0.20??0.44)x10-5 and (-0.16??0.54)x10-5 at zabs = 0.2467 and 0.6847 respectively. Possible line-ofsight velocity differences between the H i and molecular absorbing regions dominate these 1 ?? errors. A larger sample of mm/H i comparisons is required to reliably quantify this uncertainty and provide a potentially crucial check on the MM result.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine-structure constant</field><field name="subject">Quasars</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19062</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors which affect refractive outcome following LASIK for myopia.</field><field name="creator">Feltham, Mark Hayes, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To improve the predictability, accuracy and stability of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), by evaluating the clinical, procedural and tissue response factors that affect refractive outcomes. Methods: Myopic LASIK surgeries (n=5,978) were carried out using the Technolas planoscan and Nidek EC-5000 excimer lasers. Clinical variables associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target were identified using regression analysis. Possible procedural variations such as the timing of the procedure and accuracy of both the chosen keratome and excimer laser were evaluated. The predictability and accuracy of the ablation was assessed by measuring changes in corneal thickness during and after the procedure. Factors influencing the stability of refractive outcome were assessed. Results: Clinical factors associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target included; corrections less than 5.00 DS (OR 0.21x, 95% CI 0.11-0.40x compared with corrections over -5.00 DS[referent]), patients younger than 40 years (patients over 50 OR 8.27x, 95% CI 3.41-20.03x, patients 40 to 50 years OR 1.93x, 95% CI 0.96-3.90x, compared with patients under 40[referent]) and average pre-operative curvatures between 43.50 and 45.50D (OR 0.39x, 95% CI 0.18-0.83 compared with curvatures of less than 43.50D [referent]). Refractive stability was improved using optic zone sizes between 5.5-6.0 mm, reduced myopic corrections, flatter pre-operative corneal curvatures and thicker corneal flaps (R??=25%, p&amp;lt0.001). Procedural factors associated with poorer outcomes included: thinner measured flap thickness, deeper ablations and the use of the automated corneal shaper (ACS) microkeratome with a novice surgical team (R??=34%, p &amp;lt 0.001). Delaying the ablation from 20 to 90 seconds (s) after flap lift was associated with a more stable refractive outcome at three months (p=0.017). In the 90 s following flap lift, the cornea thinned by 5??3%. The ablation rate per scan varied between procedures, however, the effect on refractive outcome was small (r=0.15, p=0.267). Changes in central corneal thickness indicated refractive stability (p=0.039). Conclusions: Applying the optimal clinical and procedural factors as described afforded a refractive outcome in a further 8% of cases, resulting in 94% to 96% of cases within ??0.50 DS of target. Refractive predictability was limited due to the inability of the keratome to produce a consistent corneal flap thickness and unexpected changes in corneal thickness. The accuracy of refractive outcome will decrease with larger ablations. The degree of refractive inaccuracy with high refractive corrections (&amp;gt -10.00 D) can be over 1.00 D.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LASIK (Eye surgery)</field><field name="subject">Myopia</field><field name="subject">Eye</field><field name="subject">Refractive errors</field><field name="subject">laser in-situ keratomileusis</field><field name="subject">Eye surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20800</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rehabilitation of the impaired doctor by the New South Wales Medical Board</field><field name="creator">Pethebridge, Andrew, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The New South Wales Medical Board established a Health Programme for the assessment and rehabilitation of doctors whose clinical performance was impaired by alcohol or psychoactive substance use, mental or physical illness. This programme was developed to be individualized to the needs of each registrant.  The present study has three aims: 1. To describe those doctors who participated in the Board???s Health Programme. 2. To chart the duration of involvement of these doctors through the programme. 3. To examine the outcomes associated with this programme. The study is based on the prospective cohort of all 181 impaired doctors who participated in the Health Programme between July 1st 1993 and April 30th 2001. Information on each registrant was collected at the time of the initial assessment and at each review conducted as part of the programme. Additional qualitative data was  also collected and supplemented by a file audit conducted in August and September 2001.  One hundred and eighty-one doctors were prospectively monitored as part of this study. The largest source of impairment was psychiatric illness (45.3%), 77% of the doctors were male. The average age of the cohort was 41.6 (sd 11.1) years. Impaired doctors were more likely to be working in emergency medicine or psychiatry and be based in a rural area. Of those who had finished their involvement in the programme, successful graduates participated for a mean of 38.2 (sd 22.3) months. In general outcomes of involvement were positive, 64 of 113 (56.6%) of doctors successfully graduated from the programme. One hundred and ten of 168 (65.5%) improved during the period of their involvement and 111 of 126 (88.1%) were working in medicine. Five, 2.8% of the participants died during the period of this study. Measures of registrant insight and support tended to increase during the period of involvement with the Health Programme.  Future studies will need to establish evidence for the most appropriate interventions with impaired doctors. This process would be strengthened by the collection of standardized data across intervention programmes, supplemented with functional assessments and the collection of qualitative data.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical Board</field><field name="subject">Impaired Registrants Program</field><field name="subject">Health Program</field><field name="subject">Physicians</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Discipline</field><field name="subject">Substance use</field><field name="subject">Alcohol use</field><field name="subject">Drug use</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Medical policy</field><field name="subject">Doctors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22038</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silica-on-silicon lightwave circuits based on multimode interference for optical communications</field><field name="creator">Jin, Zhe, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommuncations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis focuses the design and fabrication of silica-on-silicon multimode interference (MMI) devices for optical communications. Firstly, the relationship between different kinds of multimode interference was established for the first time. This gives a clearer understanding of the multimode interference and helps to design better performance optical MMI devices With the consideration of weak lateral light confinement, different kinds of novel approaches to designing high performance MMI devices are developed. The first new approach is for optimization of   silica-on-silicon MMI couplers. It is shown that the length of the multimode section can be varied in a well-defined range to find optimal device performance. The range is linked to the propagation constant spacing of fundamental and higher order modes of the multimode waveguide. The second approach is to introduce a new criterion for designing a   MMI coupler with central input. According to overlapping interference analysis, one image space should be left for the adjacent output waveguides because of the lateral distribution of alternatively vanishing and non-vanishing images.  This consideration is neglected in previous work and is shown to be important for achieving good uniformity MMI power splitters.  Thirdly, a new design of silica-on-silicon multimode interference (MMI) device is proposed. Deeply etched air trenches define the boundaries of the multimode section to achieve strong lateral confinement, resulting in lower loss and imbalance. The access waveguides, however, are buried channel and square core, giving low fibre insertion loss and low polarization dependence. The novel design balanced requirement of the strong lateral confinement of the field in the multimode waveguides and the matching between the fiber and the access waveguides.  Then a new approach of designing silica-on-silicon optical switches based on cascaded MMI couplers is presented. The approach combines the transfer matrix method, optimisation of the MMI dimensions, and mode propagation analysis (MPA) for calculation of phase shifts. The feasibility of the large port count switches is also discussed. It is shown that the good performance devices can be realized with a large port count of 32.  Finally MMI couplers based on silica-on-silicon optical waveguides were fabricated. The Ge-doped silica waveguides were fabricated by HC-PECVD and RIE. Fabrication processes such as thin film deposition and etching are discussed. Good performance devices have been realized.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optical communications</field><field name="subject">Optical wave guides</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23993</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and ecology of predatory marine flatworms (Platyhelminthes: Polycladida) in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ka-Man, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Marine flatworms are important mobile predators on hard substrate, however little is known about their life history. I recorded seven species of flatworms in Botany Bay and described a new species of flatworm Imogine lateotentare sp. nov. It is distinguished from other species in the same genus by having small, transparent and inconspicuous tentacles and continuous bands of numerous frontal and cerebral eyes. This new flatworm species was found closely associated with the barnacle Balanus variegatus (Darwin, 1854) on which it fed. Marine flatworms provide elaborate parental care to their offspring but its significance has not been experimentally confirmed. I provided quantitative measurements of the significance of parental care behaviour in Echinoplana celerrima and Stylochus pygmaeus under controlled laboratory conditions. I also examined the changes in reproductive behaviour of E. celerrima and the hatching success of their eggs when exposed to three putative flatworm egg predators. Brooding behaviour of neither species of flatworm enhanced the hatching success of their eggs and exposure of E. celerrima to the potential egg predators did not affect the timing of hatching or hatching success of its eggs. However, E. celerrima spent more time guarding their eggs when exposed to the potential egg predators. Brooding may be an innate behaviour in marine flatworms but it is not essential to their reproductive success. Marine flatworms are closely associated with sessile organisms and these assemblages are common in bays and estuaries which are subject to anthropogenic inputs from various sources. Impacts of pollutants are known for many flatworm prey species but little is known about the effects on the flatworm themselves. I examined the influence of sublethal concentrations of copper ranging from 0 to 50 ??g L-1 on the predatory and reproductive behaviour of Stylochus pygmaeus. These worms were more sensitive to low levels of copper pollution than their barnacle preys. Response of flatworms to physical stimulation, number of egg batches laid and hatching success were greatly reduced at higher copper concentrations. In areas polluted by heavy metals, flatworm populations will be affected at lower concentrations than their barnacle prey and which may alter sessile invertebrate community structure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycladida -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Platyhelminthes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24178</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Muslim consumers' motivation towards Islam and their cognitive processing of performing taboo behaviors</field><field name="creator">Muhamad, Nazlida</field><field name="description">Although religion is an important cultural force that shapes consumers' values and norms, the taboo stigma attached to the investigation of religion's influences in marketing areas has limited the knowledge about how religion influences consumers' decision-making. This study explored the affect of Muslim motivation in following Islam in their decision-making process to perform behaviors that are subject to Islamic rulings known as fatwa. Three behaviors that are subject to fatwa declarations; smoking, listening to popular music and buying a Coca Cola soft drink, were chosen. Utilizing the Theory of Planned Behaviors, this study examined: 1) If a Muslim's motivation in following Islam is an effect in their cognitive and behavioral responses regarding the fatwa prohibited behaviors. 2) If Muslim motivation in following Islam is an effect in their decision-making in deciding to whether to perform fatwa prohibited behaviors. Based on a Malaysian university student sample, multiple analyses of variance with covariate's (MANCOVA) results show that a Muslim's motivation in following Islam, his or her gender and their interaction have significant effects in their responses in regards to the behaviors. Muslim males, who are extrinsically motivated towards Islam tended to report a greater intention to smoke, buy a Coca Cola soft drink and tended to report they experienced more social pressure to smoke as compared to others. Nonetheless, SEM analysis found that the sample's responses on items related to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) about buying a Coca Cola soft drink brand did not fit the model. Other unaccounted for factors that may be related to the Muslims' decision-making about the product, such as possible consumer animosity, was not captured in the survey. The sample&#146;s responses on smoking and listening to popular music provided a good fit to the model proposed. ii This study found that the Muslim respondents' motivation in following Islam had an effect on the role of perceived social pressure in their planning to smoke, and on the role of perceived social pressure in their planning to listen to popular music. Respondents' motivation in following Islam also had an effect on the role of perception of control in their reported smoking and listening to popular music. The intrinsically motivated Muslim consumers tended to be more concerned about others approval in their deciding to smoke and to listen to popular music, than the average extrinsic respondents. The intrinsic Muslim respondents also tended to perceive having incomplete control over smoking and listening to popular music, compared to their extrinsic counterparts. Respondents' attitudes towards smoking and listening to popular music were found to be not relevant in respondents' decision-making to perform the behaviors. This study also found evidence for the effect of type of fatwa prohibition ruling in Muslim respondents' responses and decision-making to perform behaviors in this study. Findings from this study suggest a significant effect of fatwa rulings on products or behaviors, among the sample of young Malaysian Muslim respondents. The findings highlight the needs for marketers to understand nature of fatwa rulings on products, in order to win over Muslim consumers in the marketplace.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Behavioral assessment</field><field name="subject">Commercial products -- Religious aspects -- Islam</field><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Consumers -- Religious aspects -- Islam</field><field name="subject">Economics -- Religious aspects -- Islam</field><field name="subject">Fatwas -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Islam -- Economic aspects -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Religious influences</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">Theory of planned behaviour</field><field name="subject">Consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">Fatwa</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0011</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of modal analysis to strongly stratified lakes</field><field name="creator">Shimizu, Kenji</field><field name="description">Modal analysis for strongly stratified lakes was extended to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of the basin-scale motions. By viewing the basin-scale motions as a superposition of modes, that have distinct periods and three-dimensional structures, the method provides a conceptual understanding for the excitation, evolution, and damping of the basin-scale motions. Once the motion has been decomposed into modes, their evolution and energetics may be extracted from hydrodynamic simulation results and field data. The method was applied to Lake Biwa, Japan, and Lake Kinneret, Israel, and used for a theoretical study. The real lake applications showed that winds excited basin-scale motions that had a surface layer velocity structure similar to the wind stress pattern. Three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations of Lake Biwa indicated that most of the energy input from winds was partitioned into the internal waves that decayed within a few days. The gyres, on the other hand, received much less energy but dominated the dynamics during calm periods due to their slow damping. Analyses of field data from Lake Kinneret suggested that the internal waves, excited by the strong winds every afternoon, were damped over a few days primarily due to bottom friction. Theoretical investigations of damping mechanisms of internal waves revealed that bottom friction induced a velocity anomaly at the top of the boundary layer that drained energy from the nearly inviscid interior by a combination of internal wave cancelling and spin-down. These results indicate that gyres induce long-term horizontal transport near the surface and internal waves transfer energy from winds to near-bottom mixing. Modal structure of dominant basin-scale internal waves can induce large heterogeneity of nearbottom mass transfer processes. The method presented here provides a tool to determine how basin-scale motions impact on biogeochemical processes in stratified lakes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Internal waves</field><field name="subject">Lakes -- Circulation</field><field name="subject">Stratified flow -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Model analysis</field><field name="subject">Internal wave</field><field name="subject">Lake hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Gyre</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0079</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Positron moderation and apparatus for low energy electron and positron spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Wilkie, Peter</field><field name="description">Surface-analysis and treatment apparatus have been variously designed, manufactured, developed, and commissioned or re-commissioned, for characterising the surfaces and efficiency of positron moderators based around 3 &#181;m thick polycrystalline-tungsten foil.
