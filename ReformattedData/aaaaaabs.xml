This study  explored child sex offenders' expectations for and experiences of reintegration into the  community. A longitudinal design was used in which semi-structured interviews covering  issues identified in the literature as being related to reintegration. Nine offenders were  interviewed within one week prior to release from prison, 3 months post-release and 6  months post-release. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Seven themes  emerged that identified child sex offenders' expectations for release that included fear of  community members' reactions, the importance of having pre-arranged accommodation and  employment, social support, relationships with probation officers, maintaining optimism for a  new way of life, and the place of cultural needs. Participants' expectations for release closely  reflected their experiences of release. Negative community reactions were encountered and  were stressful, there were problems finding accommodation and employment, social support  was important, relationships with probation officers were problematic, as was building a new  life, and there were issues concerning accountability to one's cultural group. This data  confirmed that most child sex offenders fear their release from prison into the community  and once released struggle to live in society. Overall reintegration planning was simplistic  and aimed primarily to manage risk factors rather than promote positive reintegration. Those  offenders who were most successful on release, tended to have more comprehensive  reintegration plans which enabled them to visualise what life would be like after release,  consequently increasing their optimism that they could live successfully in the community.  Recommendations are made to enhance current reintegration.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5870</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intertextuality as a conceptual tool for the teaching of writing: Designing professional development that will transfer</field><field name="creator">Jesson, Rebecca Ngaire</field><field name="description">Professional development of teachers in writing should lead to quality writing programmes in schools, resulting in accelerated student progress across a variety of communicative purposes for writing (genre). However, interventions commonly assess students in a single writing purpose at the beginning and end of each year. The aim of this study was to design professional development that would raise achievement for students across a variety of purposes for writing. To this end, two differing professional development interventions were designed in which teachers explicitly investigated relationships among written texts using theories of intertextuality. This mixed-methods intervention study employed a quasi-experimental design, which  collected student achievement and classroom observation data to assess the relative  effectiveness of the two professional development programmes in writing instruction  in six schools in Auckland. While both programmes focused on the intertextual nature  of writing, the first looked at a specific purpose for writing; the second offered a  broader writing focus by comparing and contrasting texts written for differing  purposes. To illuminate how teachers&#8217; participation in each of these professional  development types influenced classroom programmes, two teachers from each were  observed in depth as case-studies.  Student assessment information was analysed from schools in each of the groups to  ascertain the relative effectiveness of each professional development type in  ii  accelerating student achievement in a targeted writing purpose and also in other  purposes for writing. Repeated measures ANOVAs show differences in the  achievement gains between the students of the two groups, not in the targeted purpose  but in other purposes for writing. Classroom observations and case study results  indicated that teachers in both professional development groups used intertextual links  as a basis for their classroom programmes in similar ways. Thus, it is hypothesised  that the difference in student achievement patterns between the two groups may be the  result of differences in the depth of teacher learning provided by the professional  development.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5899</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controllable fabrication of zinc oxide functional nano-/micro-structure in aqueous solution</field><field name="creator">Yan, Xiaodong</field><field name="description">Nanostructures of ZnO show intriguing chemical, electrical, and physical properties and  are promising for a broad range of applications in catalysis, electronics and photonics.  Cost-effective techniques that can be used to prepare structures with controllable  compositional, structural, and functional properties are fundamental to the utilization of ZnO  in small scale devices with enhanced performance. Although many methods have been  developed to fabricate ZnO nanostructures, systematic research on functional materials  development based on ZnO is still needed as this fascinating material probably has the richest  family of low-dimensional nanostructures.  The research reported in this thesis aims to develop ZnO-based nanostructural materials  using a facile and low-temperature aqueous solution growth approach, to analyze their  compositional, mechanical, structural, and functional properties using advanced  characterization techniques, to get a better understanding of the mechanisms behind  nanostructure growth, and to explore their potentials in catalytic, optical, and electronic  applications.  In the first part of this thesis, low-dimensional ZnO nano-/micro-rods with tailored  structural property (growth direction, aspect ratio, and surface distribution density) were  grown on glass substrates in aqueous solutions containing zinc salt and  hexamethylenetetramine at temperatures generally lower than 95oC. The substrates were  pre-deposited with a thin layer of ZnO seeds using a magnetron sputter. The potential  influences of growth conditions, typically including concentration, pH, type of zinc salt,  solution temperature, reaction duration, and inorganic or organic additive, have been  subjected to systematic investigation. This led to an improved understanding of the chemical  reactions and nucleation/growth processes involved in the morphological evolution of  ZnO-based hierarchical nanostructures.  The second part of the thesis, ZnO nano-/micro-rod arrays with controllable distribution  density have been successfully synthesized by adjusting the initial pH of the weak acidic  growth solution. ZnO arrays with a large inter-rod space provide a good opportunity for characterizing the property of an individual rod. In this research, mechanical property tests  have been successfully peformed directly on a single rod without the need of any complicated  sample preparation. The electronic properties of these aligned ZnO nanorod arrays have also  been explored by studying the I-V characteristics of both heterojuction and homojuction p-n  devices.  In next two chapters, complex ZnO structures, including nanotubes and  three-dimensional ball-shaped clusters have been presented and disscussed, respectively. The  morphology and microstructure of these structures were characterized by scanning electron  microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and in-situ cathodoluminescence. The  corresponding growth mechanisms were proposed based on the analysis of the  characterization results.  Chapter 7 describes that aligned ZnO nano-rod arrays were further used as templates to  prepare a novel composite nanostructure. By coating these ZnO nanorods with TiO2  nanowires using magnetron sputtering technique, a ZnO/TiO2 core-brush structure has been  successfully achieved. Their morphology and microstructure have been investigated using  scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, powder X-ray  diffractometer, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy.  This composite nanostructure shows a significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity in  decomposition of a typical organic dye under UV and sunlight irradiation. This new structure  has many other interesting properties and may have great potential in other optoelectronic  applications.  In the last part of this thesis, conclutions and future works are addressed according to the  synthesis, characterization and application results.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5930</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thesis presented to the University of New Zealand for the Doctor of Science</field><field name="creator">Green, Rowland Alfred Weldon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1953</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5941</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternating convergent and non-convergent tectonics, 100 million years to present, Puketoro area, northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Jill A. (Jill Antoinette)</field><field name="description">The area mapped comprises 180 km2 of rolling hill country between Waitahaia and Ihungia, 70 km north of Gisborne, in the extreme northeast of the North Island of New Zealand. The region is within Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks of the northern part of the northeast-trending East Coast Deformed Belt. Six formations and one group (containing seven lithofacies) have been recognised. Mokoiwi Formation, Taitai Sandstone Member, Karekare, Whangai and Ihungia Formations have been retained. Waitahaia, Owhena and Tikihore Formations, and Mangatu siltstone, Wheturau siltstone and Te Waka greensand lithofacies are names introduced from the upper Waipaoa, Mangatu and Waitahaia Catchments. Smectite mudstone ("bentonite") is given lithofacies status here. The term Mangatu Group has been reinstated (Kenny 1984a) and the following lithofacies have been erected - Whakoau limestone, Opossum Creek sandstone and Hauturu greensand. New Rakauroa and Upper Calcareous Members and two other lithofacies are described for the Whangai Formation. Two conglomerate lithofacies, a breccia and two limestone lithofacies (Kouetumarae and Bexhaven) are recognised in the Ihungia Formation. Two autochthonous domains and three stacked allochthonous sheets are established. The autochthonous "basement" domain consists of highly deformed, sandstone-dominated submarine fan sediments of Ngaterian (Late Albian to Early Cenomanian) age (Waitahaia Formation), accreted to an eastward-younging series of subduction-related imbricated packets. The relatively undeformed mudstone-dominated, fining upwards "cover" domain has accumulated in slope basins upon the accretionary prism (older Karekare Formation - Arowhanan and Mangaotanean; Late Cenomanian to Turonian) eventually burying the "basement" inter-basin structural highs (younger Karekare Formation, Owhena and Whangai Formations - Teratan to Teurian; Senonian to Paleocene). An allochthonous domain was emplaced possibly from the northwest at approximately 25 Ma (Oligocene-Miocene boundary), scraping off uppermost autochthonous sediments in its path, and incorporating some as lubricants. The domain contains Mokoiwi and Waitahaia Formations, both of which are comparable to the autochthonous "basement"; but in addition they have been rotated during emplacement. Many smaller sheets of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, greensand and limestone are included in the overlying Mangatu Group domain, also emplaced from the northwest, probably in Tongaporutuan (latest Miocene) times. In this domain mixed lithologies within m&#233;lange and "bentonite" represent a fining upwards, passive margin sequence, poor in terrigenous detritus, of Late Cretaceous to Oligocene age. The uppermost domain is thought to have been emplaced "piggy-back" upon the Mangatu Group domain. In the study area it is composed entirely of gently folded, mudstone-dominated Miocene Ihungia Formation strata. It is proposed that the formation was deposited in basins formed in accreted Karekare and Whangai Formations during early development of the Miocene to Recent Hikurangi subduction system. Post-emplacement megascopic faulting and folding affect the region.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5945</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of rice bran oil margarine with Flora margarine and Flora pro-activ margarine for lowering cholesterol : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Eady, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Phytosterols have been shown to be effective in reducing serum cholesterol levels in numerous human clinical studies and regular consumption is recommended as part of therapeutic lifestyle changes aimed at reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fat based spreads have been shown to be a very successful vehicle for delivery of plant sterols, readily accepted by consumers and efficacious in reducing cholesterol levels. Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread is a new product entering into the market place. It is derived from rice bran oil and contains high levels of unsaponifiable material rich in phytosterols, triterpene alcohols, ferulic acid esters ([gamma]-oryzanol) and vitamin E isomers. As such it may have the potential to lower serum cholesterol levels when consumed on a daily basis. In order to establish the effectiveness of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread compared with Flora pro-activ&#174; margarine, a well established brand of plant sterol margarine already proven to lower cholesterol, a randomised double blind cross-over human clinical trial over 12 weeks was conducted. The study was divided into two treatment arms. The first arm of the study was to determine whether Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread (containing 1.5% plant sterols) could lower total and LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than standard Flora margarine (containing no plant sterols) or Flora Pro-activ&#174; margarine (containing 8% plant sterols). The second study arm tested the proposition that daily consumption of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread in conjunction with rice bran oil (containing 0.5% plant sterols) would lower total and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in isolation and more than Flora margarine in conjunction with sunflower oil. Eighty mildly hypercholesterolaemic individuals (total cholesterol [greater than or equal to] 5 mmol/L and [less than or equal to] 7.5 mmol/L) were recruited and randomised into two groups of forty. Participants were asked to continue with their normal dietary pattern but to replace any margarine/butter/fat consumption with the trial products. One group of 40 were then assigned to the first treatment arm of the study (margarine-only group) and were randomised to consume 20 g (4 teaspoons) Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine daily for 4 weeks, or 20 Flora pro-activ&#174; daily for 4 weeks. Phytosterol levels delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma]-oryzanol; Flora proactiv&#174; 1600 mg phytosterol; Flora margarine 0mg phytosterol. The second group of 40 were allocated to the second arm of the trial (margarine and oil group) and consumed 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread and 30 ml rice bran oil (RBO) daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine and 30 ml sunflower oil daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, changing treatment at the end of each 4-week period. Phytosterol amounts delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118 mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma] oryzanol; RBO 222mg mg phytosterol, 150 mg [gamma] oryzanol. Each participant consumed all three treatments in a random order over a 12 week period. At baseline and following each 4 week intervention period, measurements were made of weight and blood pressure. Venous blood samples were collected for analysis of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol: HDL-C, triglycerides and plasma phytosterols. Three-day diet records from each individual were also collected for analysis of normal dietary intake. Results showed that compared to a standard Flora margarine, Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread significantly reduced total cholesterol by 2.2% (P=0.045), total cholesterol:HDL by 4.1% (P=0.005) and LDL-C by 3.5% (P=0.016), but was not as effective overall as Flora Pro-activ&#174; which reduced total cholesterol by 4.4% (P=0.001), total cholesterol:HDL by 3.4% (P=0.014) and LDL-C by 5.6% (P=0.001). Consumption of Flora margarine alone produced no significant decrease from baseline figures in any of the cholesterol parameters measured. Surprisingly, in group two, the addition of rice bran oil to the Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread produced no differences in cholesterol levels. The reason for this unexpected result is being explored further. These results confirm that Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread is effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels when consumed as part of a normal diet. Studies have shown that a 1% reduction in LDL-C can equate to a 2% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk thus suggesting that the 3.5% reduction demonstrated by Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in this study could be effective in reducing CHD risk as much as 6% in a mildly hypercholesterolaemic population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human nutrition</field><field name="subject">rice bran oil margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora pro-activ margarine</field><field name="subject">phytosterols</field><field name="subject">plant sterols</field><field name="subject">reduction of serum cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/875</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can midlife nurses be supported to deliver bedside care in the acute clinical services until retirement? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Philosophy (Nursing), Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dodsworth, Caroline</field><field name="description">As the baby boomer generation move inexorably towards retirement and the requirement for health care services increases, the supply of nurses available to provide care at the patient bedside is forecast to fall significantly short of demand. This thesis has explored the perspectives of midlife nurses, asking what it would take to keep them in bedside practice until retirement. These nurses have provided insights which offer employers of valuable senior nurses, suggestions for maximising their potential. Through the use of questionnaires and focus groups nurses aged 45 years and over were asked what the employer can do to ensure that they are able to continue to work at the patient bedside until they reach the age of retirement. The results of this research demonstrate a workforce of nurses who are passionate and committed to their profession, but feeling disillusioned and disempowered. The nursing environment has changed over the span of their career and they find the increased workload, together with increasing professional demands, too hard to cope with. They feel they have no control over their workload, their shift patterns, or the expectations of their patients and colleagues. They want their experience to be recognized but they do not want to have to prove competency; they want to have a voice but they are unwilling to pursue postgraduate education to learn how to become visible and emancipated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">baby boomers</field><field name="subject">professional demands</field><field name="subject">age and employment</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/902</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The learning cultures of organisations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Human Resource Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ramsey, Philip L.</field><field name="description">While there is significant interest in the area of learning organisations, research in this field has been fragmented. There is a need for an holistic model of learning organisations and a measurement system that can be used by both researchers and practitioners. This thesis applies Dilemma Theory as a means of meeting this need. An holistic model was developed based on a definition of learning organisations as ones that consciously seek to balance capacities with demands. In seeking this balance, an organisation will undertake a learning journey in which it encounters a variety of learning dilemmas: points where it must choose between alternative approaches to learning, each of which is attractive. In making these choices, learning-related values are established in the organisation. These values are the basis for a "learning culture" which shapes the way learning is understood and approached by the organisational community. Presenting people within an organisation with learning-related dilemmas allows learning cultures to be charted, thus providing the basis for a measurement system. Fifteen learning-related dilemmas were identified using three processes. Firstly, literature on learning organisations was reviewed to identify conflicts between metaphors used to explain the learning organisation. Secondly, a group of New Zealand consultants took part in a Delphi Technique process, in which they established criteria for identifying learning organisations and surfaced dilemmas embedded in the criteria. Finally, 'Culture Exploration Workshops' were conducted in three organisations to surface dilemmas experienced by business practitioners engaged in learning journeys. The 15 dilemmas identified were used to chart differences between 5 organisations. The measurement system was successful in identifying differences between organisations. Results were also consistent with values that might be expected from sub-cultures represented in the sample. The study concluded by outlining a programme of research aimed at refining the measurement system and applying it to the study of learning organisations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anaerobic co-digestion of municipal primary sludge and whey : a dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters degree in Environmental Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xinyuan</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to investigate the feasibility of co-digestion of municipal primary sludge and whey by anaerobic CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor), as well as the factors that affect the performance of the co-digestion reactors. Before studying the co-digestion process, a semi-continuous whey digestion experiment was conducted to analyze the feasibility of anaerobic digestion of whey along with pH control. The results obtained from the study indicated that supplement of nutrients, trace elements as well as heavy metals was necessary to maintain the anaerobic whey digestion system. To investigate the co-digestion of primary sludge and whey process, the effects of pH, OLR (Organic Loading Rate), HRT (Hydraulic retention time) as well as the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) loading ratio of primary sludge to whey on the performance of the reactors were studied. The results of the co-digestion experiments demonstrated that it was feasible to co-digest primary sludge and whey without nutrient, trace element and heavy metal supplement. The TCOD (Total Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal efficiency and the biogas production of the co-digestion system increased with the increase of OLR. At same OLR, digestion of the mixture of primary sludge and whey with higher whey content achieved higher biogas production and TCOD removal efficiency. The anaerobic co-digestion of primary sludge and whey process performed successfully at OLR of 5.8 &#177; 0.1g COD/l.d without pH control when the COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey was approximately 70:30, due to the fact that the primary sludge may serve as buffering reagent. By adding sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to maintain the pH at 6.9 &#177; 0.1, the OLR of the co-digestion reactor could reach 8.1 &#177; 0.1 g COD/l.d at HRT of 20 days. Moreover, by co-digestion of primary sludge and whey solution, the reactor could be operated successfully at HRT of 10 days and at OLR of 7.6 &#177; 0.1 g COD/l.d with COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey of 53 : 47. The biogas production (3.2 &#177; 0.1 l/d) was 1.5 l/d higher than digestion of the same amount of primary sludge alone (1.7 &#177; 0.1 l/d).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291102 Bio-remediation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1412</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and physiological responses of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) to the presence of humans and dogs :|ba thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beausoleil, Ngaio Jessica</field><field name="description">Appendices removed due to copyright restrictions  Appendix 1: Beausoleil, N J, Stafford, KJ, Mellor, DJ. 2005.

They began in an atmosphere of disciplined quasi-military emergency response organizations. Emergency management research, theory and practice have since evolved to incorporate comprehensive facets acknowledging disasters are about people, individually and collectively and their environment. Emergency Management now includes addressing psycho-social aspects. New Zealand emergency services adopted the Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) as a result of a requirement following the Cave Creek disaster of 1995, where a multi- agency response to the event was found to be unsatisfactorily managed. Emergency management in the modern era now requires the orchestration of many and varied agencies and organisations including government and non-government organisations. These organisations are not necessarily suited to command type management styles and during a recovery phase of an incident, an approach involving a coordination style is more appropriate than a command style. An examination of the 2004 eastern Bay of Plenty flood event highlights that improved coordination by using a suitable incident management system benefits the response and recovery process. The Eastern Bay of Plenty community has social and cultural characteristics that impact on the effectiveness of emergency management outcomes. An incident management system that improves communication within the multi-agency organisation and between an emergency management organisation and the disaster-affected communities contributes to overall trauma reduction by stress reduction and facilitating early support and interventions. This allows where necessary, for modern emergency management to use systems that can utilise the unique community cultures, structures and networks that form the dynamic communities that they serve. If disasters magnify pre-existing social and community problems then the incident management system model used in a disaster can determine the degree of magnification.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Incident Management System</field><field name="subject">Disaster relief</field><field name="subject">Bay of Plenty, New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1524</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and their possible interaction with phytoestrogens : impact on bone and bone cell function in vivo and in vitro : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Raewyn Carol</field><field name="description">Inflammation is a major contributor to postmenopausal bone loss.

Using the ovariectomised rat model for postmenopausal bone loss, the relative effectiveness of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3n-6) in minimising bone loss post-ovariectomy was investigated. GLA exacerbated bone loss post ovariectomy in rats. In vitro, treatment of MC3T3-E1/4 osteoblast-like cells with GLA resulted in greater membrane-bound RANKL expression suggesting a possible stimulatory effect of GLA on osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activity. EPA had no effect on overall bone mass in vivo. DHA significantly ameliorated ovariectomy-induced bone loss possibly by increasing plasma IGF-1 concentration, modulating vitamin D metabolism and, as observed in a second study, by increasing the concentration of gamma-carboxylated osteocalcin. In vitro both EPA and DHA reduced the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced increase in membrane-bound RANKL expression in MC3T3-E1/4 osteoblast-like cells. However as RANKL-independent pathways are believed to be largely responsible for the ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclastogenesis in vivo, inhibition of RANKL expression may not significantly contribute to the prevention of ovariectomy-induced bone loss. In a second study in ovariectomised rats, combined treatment with DHA and 17&#946;-oestradiol was associated with significantly higher femur bone mineral content than either treatment alone. However, no beneficial effects of combined treatment with DHA and either of the phytoestrogens genistein or daidzein, on bone mass were apparent. In vitro, co-treatment of TNF-&#945; - exposed MC3T3-E1/4 cells with DHA and 17&#946;-oestradiol was associated with a higher cell number compared to either treatment alone indicating a protective effect of combined treatment against the cytotoxic and/or anti-proliferative effects of TNF-&#945;. In contrast, combined treatment of MC3T3-E1/4 cells with DHA and genistein, but not daidzein, was associated with significantly lower cell number than either treatment alone. As genistein, but not daidzein, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, this may indicate that DHA requires tyrosine kinase activity for its protective effect on cell number in TNF-&#945; - exposed osteoblasts. Whether DHA itself is bioactive in bone cells or whether lipid mediators formed from DHA are responsible for the observed bone-protective effects is unknown. Using lipid mediator lipidomic analysis, the presence of DHA-derived lipid mediators in bone marrow in quantities known to be physiologically significant in other tissues was confirmed. Further research into the effects of these lipid mediators in bone and confirmation of the mechanisms of action of DHA in bone cells is required. This thesis demonstrates that consumption of DHA provides some protection against ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo and mitigates the effects of inflammation on RANKL signalling and osteoblast cell number in vitro. The bone-protective effects of DHA are complemented by co-treatment with 17&#946;-oestradiol but may be inhibited by co-treatment with the phytoestrogens daidzein or genistein.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postmenopausal bone loss</field><field name="subject">Daidzein</field><field name="subject">Genistein</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Demography and distribution of the North Island robin (Petroica longipes) in a fragmented agricultural landscape of New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctorate of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Richard, Yvan</field><field name="description">Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognised worldwide as contributing to declines and extinctions of species. However, the biological factors underlying the effects of fragmentation are still often poorly understood, possibly due to the diversity of scales and approaches taken by researchers. I propose in this thesis an integrative approach that can be applied to any taxa and landscape, using a metapopulation of North Island robins (Petroica longipes) inhabiting forest patches of a fragmented agricultural landscape of New Zealand. In particular, I attempt to integrate the effects of habitat fragmentation on both habitat quality and the dispersal-driven broad scale dynamics of populations. I first analysed the distribution of robins based on presence-absence data, relating presence-absence to local habitat factors as well as size and isolation of forest patches (Chapter 2). Their distribution was found to be primarily limited by the isolation of forest patches, but was also related to some habitat factors. However, habitat fragmentation was not found to affect habitat quality, as the factors found to affect survival and productivity were unrelated to size and isolation, independent from the size or isolation of forest patches (Chapter 3). Based on the radio-tracking of juvenile robins, I applied a choice analysis technique to show that robins need woody vegetation for their natal dispersal and that they are unlikely to cross stretches of pasture greater than 150 m (Chapter 4). Juveniles dispersed a median Euclidean distance of 1129 m with a maximum of 11 km, whereas I predicted from the data that they would have dispersed a median distance of 3 km in continuous forest with a maximum of 20 km (Chapter 5). The consequences of this dispersal limitation and of variations in habitat quality were assessed using a spatially-explicit individual-based metapopulation model that incorporated realistic gap-limited dispersal behaviour of juvenile robins (Chapter 6). Whereas the movement of individuals between patches is commonly assumed to improve the persistence of populations, I found that a weaker gap-crossing ability, and therefore reduced landscape connectivity, increased the metapopulation size at equilibrium. This study highlights the complex effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on the distribution of species, but also the limits of excessive model simplification.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bird populations</field><field name="subject">Habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">Species distribution</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance excellence and strategy deployment : a framework for implementing strategic initiatives : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Production Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Alfred Maxwell</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Saunders, M &amp; Mann, R.

Only four women mayors had held office in New Zealand before the 1980s but when their numbers grew over the next two decades, there were signs of a difference in their approach to leadership. Although the amount of scholarly work published on leadership is vast, the body of academic literature on local government leadership is slender. The possibility of finding new knowledge about leadership by studying women mayors made them an intriguing area to research. The research sought answers to two questions: how do women mayors perceive exemplary mayoral leadership and explain their own leadership practice; and how do women mayors' views of leadership compare with leadership theory? The information gathered to assist in answering the research questions included: interviews with three mayoral candidates in the 1998 elections, interviews with 18 of the 19 female mayors in office during the 1998-2001 term, and a case study of Jill White, mayor of Palmerston North from 1998-2001. The case study comprised a series of interviews with Jill White during the three year term, a selection of newspaper stories about the mayor and council gathered during 1998-2001 and interviews with four key informants about Jill White's leadership after she lost the election in 2001. The findings of the research were that the research participants saw leadership as a process that took place working with the community to achieve mutually desired leadership goals. Leadership was not generated by a single person's abilities, nor was it automatically linked to a position such as being mayor, although being mayor gave a lot of opportunities to participate in and encourage leadership. Four areas participants considered to be requirements of exemplary mayoral leadership were: being at the centre of webs of people rather than at the top of a hierarchy having less concern for ego than for working towards change being committed to making a difference in the community and/or the council being prepared to sacrifice their own interests for the good of the community Comparing participants' views of leadership with leadership theory showed that their descriptions and examples of leadership were closely related to transforming leadership (Burns, 1979), whereas transactional leadership in the sense of acting in your own self-interest or trading favours with others, met with strong disapproval. The heroic paradigm of leadership that has been prevalent in the literature, with its focus on the leader, was absent from the participants' accounts. Their achievements came from working with others and they saw the ability to involve others in the leadership process as the strength of their leadership. The implication of these findings is that the focus in much of the literature on individual attributes of people in leadership positions, as if they had to 'do' all the leadership themselves, is misplaced. Being concerned to make a difference with and through others is at the core of leadership.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political leadership</field><field name="subject">Jill White</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360101 New Zealand government and politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1598</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategy instruction and teacher professional development to aid the reading comprehension of year 4 students : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vosslamber, Andrea</field><field name="description">The ability to understand what one reads is fundamental to much school learning and is part of the school curriculum. The processes used by expert readers to comprehend text can be analysed and used as a basis for comprehension instruction. Such expert readers use particular mental strategies such as rereading, paraphrasing, and predicting, and adapt these to assist them in understanding various texts. This study investigated whether the implementation of reading comprehension strategy instruction to classes of Year 4 students would result in significant gains in metacognitive abilities, standardised reading comprehension, and reading self-efficacy. The quasi-experiment involved a treatment group of 48 students in two classes who were taught by one teacher, a treatment control group of 61 students in three classes taught by three teachers, and a non-treatment control group of 41 students taught in three composite Year 3 and Year 4 classes taught by three teachers. In total, 150 Year 4 students from eight classrooms in three suburban primary schools were involved in the study. Results from 2 x 3 analyses of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures revealed differences between the treatment group and control groups in several aspects of reading comprehension ability. The treatment group performed significantly better than either control group on the Jacobs and Paris (1987) measure of metacognitive awareness of strategies (Index of Reading Awareness). Treatment group students were also more confident about their ability to perform tasks related to reading comprehension than one of the control groups. Though they also made greater gains in confidence than the other control group, these gains were not statistically significant. Gains in reading comprehension as measured by a standardised reading comprehension measure (Progressive Achievement Test of Reading Comprehension) were marginal in comparison to one of the control groups, and not significant in comparison to the other. Secondly, this study also investigated whether intensive teacher training would result in successful implementation of reading comprehension strategies. Teachers need to know how to model their own mental processes for students so that students can see the strategies being applied. They then need to demonstrate for students when and how to adapt the strategies to various texts. In addition, teachers need to know whether to target instruction to only the struggling readers in their classrooms, or to students of varying abilities. A two-year professional development programme was developed and implemented to assist primary school teachers with the implementation of reading comprehension strategy instruction in their classrooms. During the first year a group of 14 teachers participated, and during the second year one teacher remained to implement the programme. This teacher, who taught at the Year 4 level, was provided with additional professional development in the explicit teaching of reading comprehension strategies to her entire class of mixed ability students. Results from analysis of qualitative data indicated that the teacher had made significant progress in becoming competent in the teaching techniques needed for teaching reading comprehension strategies. These results suggested that the teacher moved from modelling process into content to being creative and inventive. By the end of the intervention, interviews conducted with the teacher and the students, as well as lesson observations and field notes, suggested that she had a good knowledge of the components of strategy instruction and was incorporating these in her classroom practice. Her students became increasingly aware of the teacher's central lesson aims regarding what she was teaching, why she was teaching it, and how it could be applied to the students' learning. The findings of the present study indicate that students of varying ability may improve their reading comprehension through instruction in reading comprehension strategies, though the marginal gains in standardised reading comprehension do not support this conclusively. Findings also indicate that a teacher can successfully be trained to implement reading comprehension strategy instruction in an entire class of mixed-ability students. Such findings have important implications for teacher and student education.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comprehension instruction</field><field name="subject">Metacognition</field><field name="subject">Primary school teaching</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1599</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrous oxide emission from soil under pasture as affected by grazing and effluent irrigation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Soil Science at the Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bhandral, Rita</field><field name="description">New Zealand's greenhouse gas inventory is dominated by the agricultural trace gases, CH4 and N2O instead of CO2, which is dominant on a global scale. While the majority of the anthropogenic CH4 is emitted by ruminant animals as a by-product of enteric fermentation, N2O is mainly produced by microbial processes occurring in the soil. In grazed pastoral soils, N2O is generated from N originating from dung, urine, effluent applied to land, biologically fixed N2 and fertiliser. The amount of emission depends on complex interactions between soil properties, climatic factors and management practices. Increased intensification of pastoral agriculture in New Zealand, particularly in dairying has led to an increased production of farm dairy effluent. Traditionally, direct disposal of nutrient rich farm dairy effluents (FDE) into water bodies was an acceptable practice in New Zealand, but with the introduction of the Resource Management Act (1991), discharge of effluents into surface waters is now a controlled activity and many Regional Councils encourage the land irrigation of effluents to protect surface water quality. While the impact of grazing and FDE irrigation on groundwater contamination through leaching and runoff of nutrients has been studied extensively, there has been only limited work done on the effect of these practices on air quality as affected by N2O emission. This thesis examines the effects of various factors, such as compaction due to cattle treading, and the nature, application rate and time of effluent application on N2O emission in relation to the changes in the soil physical properties and C and N transformation from a number of small plot and field experiments. The results were then used, together with data from the literature, to predict the emissions from effluent irrigated pastures using a process-based model. In grazed pastures, animal treading causes soil compaction, which results in decreased soil porosity and increased water filled pore space that stimulate the denitrification rate as well as influence the relative output of N2O and dinitrogen (N2) gases. A field plot study was conducted to determine N2O emission from different N sources as affected by soil compaction. The experiment comprised two main treatments (uncompacted and compacted) to which four N sources (natural cattle urine, potassium nitrate, ammonium sulphate and urea at the rate of 600kg N ha-1) and a control (water only) were applied. Compaction was obtained through driving close parallel tracks by the wheels of the vehicle. The changes in the soils physical properties (bulk density, penetration resistance (PR), soil matric potential and oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) due to the compaction created by the wheel traction of the vehicle were compared with the changes in these properties due to the treading effect of grazing cattle, which was monitored in another field experiment. The N2O fluxes were measured using a closed chamber technique. The compaction at the grazing trial and at the wheel traction experimental plot caused significant changes in soil bulk density, PR, soil matric potential and ODR values. Overall, the bulk density of the compacted soil was higher than the uncompacted soil by 6.7% (end of 3 weeks) and 4.9% (end of 1 week) for the field experiment and the grazing trial, respectively. Results suggest that maximum compaction occurred in the top 0-2 cm layer. Compaction caused an increase in N2O emission, which was more pronounced in the nitrate treatment than in the other N sources. In the case of the compacted soil, 10% of the total N applied in the form of nitrate was emitted, whereas from uncompacted soil this loss was only 0.7%. N2O loss was found to decrease progressively from the time of application of N treatments. Total N2O emission for the three month experimental period ranged from 2.6 to 61.7 kg N2O-N ha-1 for compacted soil and 1.1 to 4.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 for uncompacted soil. In the second field plot experiment, the results of N2O fluxes from treated farm dairy effluent (TFDE), untreated farm dairy effluent (UFDE), treated piggery farm effluent (TPFE) and treated meat effluent (TME) applied to 2m x 1m plots for 'autumn' (February-April) and 'winter' (July-September) are described. Effluent irrigation resulted in higher emissions during both the seasons indicating that the supply of C and N through effluent irrigation contributed to increased N2O emission. The highest emissions were observed from TPFE (2.2% of the applied N) and TME (0.6% of the applied N) during the autumn and winter seasons, respectively. Emissions generated by the TFDE application were the lowest of the four effluent sources but higher than the water and control treatments. The effect of effluent irrigation on N2O emission was higher during the autumn season than the winter season. The effect of key soil and effluent factors such as water filled pore space (WFPS), nitrate, ammonium and available C in soil and effluents on N2O emission was examined using regression equations. The third field plot experiment examined the effect of four TFDE application rates (25mm, 50mm, 75mm and 100mm) on N2O emission. Treatments were added to 2m x 1m plots lined with plastic sheet to restrict the flow of effluent. The N2O emission increased with the increasing effluent loading rate, with the emission ranging from 0.8 to 1.2% of the added N. This can be attributed to the increasing addition of N and C in the soil with the increasing application rate of the effluent. Besides, providing C and N substrates, the effluent application increased the WFPS of the soil, thereby creating conditions conducive for dentrification and N2O emission. A field experiment was conducted at the Massey University No 4 Dairy farm in which N2O emission and related soil and environmental parameters were monitored for two weeks following the TFDE applications over an area of 0.16 ha in September 2003 (21mm), January 2004 (23mm) and February 2004 (16mm). Emissions were measured by a closed chamber technique with 20 chambers for each treatment, in order to cover the variability present in the field. N2O emissions increased immediately after the application of the effluent, and subsequently dropped after about two weeks. The total N2O emitted from the effluent application after the first, second and third irrigation was 2%, 4.9% and 2.5%, respectively of the total N added through the effluent. The higher emission observed during the second effluent irrigation event was due to high soil moisture content during the measurement period. Moreover effluent was applied immediately after a grazing event leading to more N and C input into the soil through excretal deposition. In this experiment the residual effect of effluent application on N2O emission was also examined by monitoring emissions 12 weeks after the effluent application. The emissions from the control and effluent irrigated plots were similar, indicating that there was no residual effect of the effluent irrigation on N2O emissions. In a separate field study, N2O emission was monitored at the Massey University No 4 Dairy farm to examine the effect of a grazing event of moderate intensity on N2O emission. The treatments consisted of a grazed and an ungrazed control. The fluxes from the grazed site were much higher than for the ungrazed site with the total emissions from the former site being 8 times higher than the latter site for the entire experimental period. A modified New Zealand version of denitrification decomposition model (DNDC), a process based model, namely "NZ-DNDC", was used to simulate N2O emission from the TFDE application in the field experiment. The model was able to simulate the emission as well as the WFPS within the range measured in the field. But simulated emissions from the TFDE were slightly lower than measured values. Improvements in the parameterisation for effluent irrigation are likely to further improve the N2O simulations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural effluent</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse gas emissions</field><field name="subject">Soil compaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1600</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From popular art to mass culture : autonomous technology and the intellectual history of fast food : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Media Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Bancroft, Malcolm James</field><field name="description">In recent years, Media Studies has become increasingly influenced by the Social Sciences. In particular, aesthetic approaches within the field have been diminishing. Humanistic research into fast food is just as scarce. This study seeks to reclaim the humanistic endeavour of aesthetic media research, and to apply it to a study of American fast food. The McDonald's hamburger is used as the prototype. The study explores the difficulty in postulating an aesthetic arena in Media Studies. A case is made for the burger as an instance of popular art, and various models of poplar art are engaged to this end. The burger does have aesthetic properties, but they are fleeting and inhibited by the technological nature of the artefact. At the same time, it also exists as an example of mass culture, as it increasingly sets the framework for popular art. An existentialist approach to fast food shows up its compulsive nature, and the autonomous role of technology emerges as a theme which both helps explain its popularity and helps to limit its artistic potential.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">McDonalds</field><field name="subject">Mass culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1601</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discourse analysis of institutionalised logics in the field of New Zealand rugby 1985 and 2005 : a thesis presented for the partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Business and Administration at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Harris, David J.</field><field name="description">Why do carefully considered and reasoned decisions in organisational settings so often produce unintended and sub-optimal outcomes? This is an on-going and vexing question for those charged with the governance of organisations. This research focuses on one potential contributory factor - the institutionalised logics of a particular field. Taking an historical perspective, the research examines the nature of taken-for-granted ideas and understandings that might be seen to have existed amongst the communities involved in New Zealand rugby in 1985 and in 2005. It is proposed that these taken-for-granted ideas and understandings might have an impact upon the success, or failure, of initiatives and decisions made by those charged with the governance of the game. Utilising ideas emerging from institutional theory (Freidland &amp; Alford, 1991; Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977; Oliver, 1992; Thornton &amp; Ocasio, 1999; Tolbert &amp; Zucker, 1999), and following the work of Phillips, Lawrence and Hardy (2004), these ideas and understandings are offered, conceptually, as institutionalised logics, simultaneously facilitating and constraining action in the field. Given that these understandings might be inchoate and hidden, an interpretive model of discourse analysis is employed to examine their nature. The data comes from texts created in 1985 and 2005. and from 32 in-depth interviews that were used to develop an insider's interpretation of the context. The analysis uses data from the interviews and the texts to build an interpretation of the nature of twenty such logics that might be seen to have existed in the chosen years. The results are presented as discrete understandings, explained in the context of the environment at the time. Examples of the institutionalised logics uncovered include. "The clubs are history', 'Central control is the way to go!' and 'The coach is king'. The research presents an interpretation of evolving institutionalised logics which might impact on the way decisions of the New Zealand Rugby Union are interpreted by the communities affected. The discussion highlights the implications that these understandings might have for decisions made about the game in New Zealand. It is argued that these taken-for-granted ideas and understandings, and their changing and contradictory nature, should be explicitly considered by those charged with governance of New Zealand rugby. An analysis of the institutionalised logics might contribute towards improved organisational performance, by providing another piece in the puzzle of governance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1602</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and irrigation studies with processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Johnstone, Paul R.</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Appendix IV.

Unlike traditional technical analysis which is based around close prices, these strategies generate buy and sell signals that are based on the relationship between open, high, low and close prices within a day and over consecutive days. Traditional technical analysis, which has been the focus of previous academic research, has a long-term focus with positions being held for months and years. In contrast, candlestick technical analysis has a short-term focus with positions being held for ten days or less. This difference is significant as surveys of market participants indicate that they place 50 per cent more importance on technical analysis for horizons of a week than they do for horizons of a year. Candlestick technical analysis was developed on rice data in Japan in the 1700s so the tests in this thesis, using Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA) component stock data for the 1992 - 2002 period, are clearly out of sample tests. These tests are more robust to criticisms of data snooping than is the existing technical analysis literature. Proponents of technical analysis in the Western world would have had the opportunity to have become aware of candlestick trading strategies by this study's timeframe and would also have had the opportunity to source the data and software necessary to implement these strategies. So, a direct test of market efficiency is possible. This was not achievable by authors of many previous papers, who used data starting in the early 1900s and techniques that could not have been implemented at that time. Using an innovative extension of the bootstrap methodology, which allows the generation of random open, high, low and close prices, to test the profitability of candlestick technical trading strategies showed that candlestick technical analysis does not have value. There is no evidence that a trader adhering to candlestick technical analysis would out-perform the market.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investment analysis</field><field name="subject">Stock price forecasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1604</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indonesian energy policy pathways : from past trends to future alternatives : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Resource and Environmental Planning at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Muliadiredja, Emy Perdanahari</field><field name="description">The main achievement of this thesis has been the development of an operational system dynamics model of the Indonesian energy system. This model attempts to integrate a wide range of data so that policy-makers can understand the connections between economic, environmental and energy policy objectives. This is the first such model to be developed for Indonesia, building on previous modelling efforts that have been restricted to regression-based forecasting and optimisation modelling. The first part of the thesis provides a systematic analysis of background data, information and the context for the model development. These chapters review the historical and political context of energy developments in Indonesia; review past energy policies as well as emerging energy policy objectives; analyse the determinants of energy demand (by regression and divisia decomposition methods) and review energy supply options. The regression analysis concluded that GDP and household income had the most significant effect on energy demand. The effect of fuel price rises, on the other hand, did not exert a significant effect on energy demand. The divisia decomposition method found that, over the entire Indonesian economy, technical change was found to give a greater contribution to energy efficiency improvements (as measured by the energy:GDP ratio) than structural changes. The system dynamics model was developed and validated using the extensive data collected, refined and analysed in the first part of the thesis. The model consisted of an economic module (17 sector input-output model), energy demand module, electric power module, heat and transport fuel module, primary energy supply module and an environmental module. Five scenarios were developed from this model in order to analyse possible energy development pathways for Indonesia, over the 1998-2020 period. These scenarios reflected five themes Business-as-Usual, Environmentally Beneficial, Economic Efficiency, Self-Sufficiency and Balancing Trade-Offs. These scenarios were assessed using a number of policy evaluation criteria to measure various energy, economic and environmental policy objectives. All of these scenarios indicated that Indonesia's energy demand and hence CO2 emissions will grow significantly over the scenario period, even if Indonesia introduces some quite stringent polices to restrict these trends - eg, CO2 emissions are expected to increase by 189% under the 'Business-as-Usual' scenario; and even though they can be reduced to a 85% increase under the 'Environmentally Beneficial' scenario, this is still a significant and somewhat alarming increase in CO2 emissions. The scenarios also highlighted the trade-offs between different sets of policy objectives as an aid to energy planning and policy-making. Finally, further areas of research that could improve the model and its use were identified: improving the data on energy supply and demand (particularly the end-use characterisation), endogenise the economic growth dynamics into the model rather than depending on regression analysis, possibly converting the input-output structure into a computable general equilibrium model, including more sectoral detail, making the model at least partly spatially-specific, and investigating more participatory approaches for further developing the model so as to enhance its uptake.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy development</field><field name="subject">Environmental policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1605</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on heat- and pressure-induced interactions of milk proteins : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Patel, Hasmukh Ambalal</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at understanding the high pressure (HP) processing-induced interactions of milk proteins in whey protein concentrate (WPC) solutions, in skim milk and in pure protein systems. The changes in milk proteins induced by heat treatments in the same systems under selected conditions were also evaluated. The main approach taken was to elucidate changes in the whey proteins in heat- and pressure-treated samples from common aliquots, under identical conditions, using various one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) techniques in the absence or presence of a disulphide bond reducing agent. In some instances, the samples were also analysed using small deformation rheology, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results of the present study indicated that, in general terms, heat treatment and HP treatment had common effects, i.e. denaturation and subsequent aggregation of whey proteins. Both heat treatment and HP treatment generated disulphide-bonded and hydrophobically bonded aggregates of whey proteins. However, the sensitivities of each of the whey proteins to heat treatment [immunoglobulin (Ig) &gt; lactoferrin (LF) &gt; bovine serum albumin (BSA) &gt; &#946;-laetoglobulin B (&#946;-LG B) &gt; &#946;-LG A &gt; &#945;-lactalbumin (&#945;-LA)] and pressure treatment (&#946;-LG B &gt; &#946;-LG A &gt; IgG &gt; LF &gt; BSA &gt; &#945;-LA) were considerably different. Also, HP treatment generated a comparatively greater proportion of smaller aggregates than did heat treatment. The effects of protein concentration, intensity of pressure treatment, holding time and pressurising temperature on whey protein aggregation in WPC solutions were investigated. The rate of aggregation of whey proteins increased with an increase in the concentration of protein in the WPC solution and the pressurising temperature. The combination of low protein concentration, mild pressure treatment (200 MPa) and low pressurising temperature (20&#176;C) led to minimal loss of native-like and SDS-monomeric &#946;-LG, whereas the combination of high protein concentration, severe pressure treatment (600 MPa) and higher pressuring temperature (40&#176;C and higher) led to significant loss of both native-like and SDS-monomeric &#946;-LG. The sensitivity of pressure-resistant whey proteins, such as &#945;-LA and BSA, to the aggregation was significantly increased at pressurising temperatures of 40&#176;C and higher. Self-supporting gels were formed when 8 or 12% (w/v) WPC solutions were pressure treated at 600-800 MPa. 20&#176;C. Detailed analysis of the behaviour of the proteins during the formation of these gels revealed a novel pathway, suggesting that intermolecular disulphide bond formation occurred at high pressure but that hydrophobic association became important after the HP treatment. In the later part of the study, heat- and HP-induced interactions of caseins and whey proteins were studied in a more complex system, i.e. skim milk. With the application of modified PAGE techniques, it was possible to show that the high molecular weight disulphide-bonded aggregates that were formed by HP treatment of skim milk contained disulphide-linked complexes consisting of &#945;S2-casein (&#945;S2-CN) as well as &#954;-CN, &#946;-LG and other whey proteins. The results showed that the effects of heat treatment and HP on the interactions of the caseins and whey proteins in milk were significantly different. The accessibility of &#945;S2-CN and the formation of complexes involving &#945;S2-CN, &#954;-CN and whey proteins in the HP-treated milk, as demonstrated using the modified 2D PAGE technique, and as explained by possible proposed reactions of the caseins and whey proteins in pressure-treated milk, was an important finding of the present study. Finally, a study on the effects of HP treatment in model systems using pure proteins in solution, both singly or in binary and ternary combinations, generated very useful information and clarified the role of each protein in pressure-induced aggregation and interactions of milk proteins in complex systems such as WPC and milk. It was found that the reactions of &#946;-LG were not significantly affected by other proteins such as &#945;-LA or BSA, but that the presence of &#946;-LG in the system catalysed the reactions of other proteins such as &#945;-LA or BSA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Milk processing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1606</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic diversity and flowering in Clianthus and New Zealand Sophora (Fabaceae) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Song, Jiancheng</field><field name="description">Clianthus and New Zealand Sophora species are woody legumes endemic to New Zealand, with high ornamental value and biodiversity significance. Research was conducted to address the fact that little is known about the details of their developmental characteristics, genetic structure and relatedness of the wild populations, and their molecular mechanism of flowering. Genetic diversity and relatedness of all remaining wild populations of Clianthus and samples of all New Zealand Sophora species were investigated using ISSR and AFLP markers. Genetic relationships were established for Sophora species, Clianthus wild populations and cultivars, and most individuals in each of the wild Clianthus populations. The molecular evidence did not support the recent separation on morphological grounds of the two Clianthus species, C. maximus and C. puniceus. Postharvest treatments were tested to extend vase life of the short-lived cut Clianthus maximus and Sophora tetraptera flowers. Appropriately treated Clianthus cut flowers lasted 10-12 days in the vase, with over 80% of flowers opening. Similar postharvest treatments did not improve the vase performance of cut Sophora flowers. Detailed calendars of vegetative and reproductive growth, and of floral ontogeny were developed for Clianthus and Sophora. Contrasting behaviours of both vegetative and reproductive growth were observed between these two legumes. A long period of summer-autumn dormancy of vegetative and reproductive growth in Sophora, and mass abortion of initiated Clianthus inflorescences during most of the year were observed. Unusual floral ontogeny processes, with precocious carpel initiation and delayed petal development, were observed in both species. An efficient two-step quantitative real-time RT-PCR protocol for detailed gene expression analysis of large numbers of samples was developed using SYBR Green DNA dye and a LightCycler instrument. The consistency of this protocol was optimised with regards to sample and template preparation, primer design, and determination of appropriate internal controls for gene expression quantification. Differences of gene expression in the range of 5-7 orders were effectively detected. Putative partial homologues of LEAFY, APETALAI, PISTILLATA, and AGAMOUS were isolated from both Clianthus and Sophora. Detailed temporal and spatial expression of each floral identity gene was investigated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The expression patterns, together with the sequence similarity, showed that these new isolated gene fragments were most probably LEAFY, APETALAI, PISTILLATA, and AGAMOUS homologues in Clianthus and Sophora, and that the ABC model of floral development is generally applicable to both species. However, there were important variations in temporal expression patterns compared to those of herbaceous species. A bimodal expression pattern of LEAFY and APETALAI homologues was observed in Sophora, but not in Clianthus, coincident with their contrasting patterns of floral initiation and development.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kakabeak</field><field name="subject">Kowhai</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1607</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour standards under decentralisation and globalisation : the impact of the minimum wage policy in West Java, Indonesia : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Surbakti, Indra Murty</field><field name="description">This study explores the importance of the minimum wage policy in West Java, Indonesia, within the overall framework of development and in the face of globalisation and decentralisation. A holistic approach to the minimum wage policy is applied. Generally, the study assesses the impact of decentralized minimum wage fixing processes on employment and participation of trade unions. In addition, it explores whether the minimum wage policy assists workers in coping with the negative effects of globalisation. It also explores the link between minimum wages and decent work. This study reveals that while there is some evidence of employment losses due to increases in wage levels in West Java, it did not find conclusive evidence that minimum wage levels were the main factor responsible for the employment decline. It is likely that a combination of factors such as a decrease in global demand for Indonesian manufacturing products and the current macro-economic conditions in the country, are also responsible for the employment decline. This study finds that the process of minimum wage fixing at local level has a positive impact on trade union participation in wage bargaining. The empowerment of trade unions through new legislation has enabled independent trade unions to flourish, which allows workers to join any trade unions. Consequently, minimum wage bargaining at district/city level is more dynamic than the centralized system of minimum wage bargaining in the past. Trade unions are able to express their views on what the minimum wage levels should be. Moreover, the minimum wage fixing processes at local level have the potential to promote decent work. The minimum wage fixing processes are an alternative to wage bargaining and can accommodate even sectors where trade unions are least active or non-existent. The minimum wage processes at district/city level are already established and they are in position to expand to a wider framework of providing welfare for workers. However, decent work objectives will not be achieved without the full cooperation of both central and local governments. Under the current decentralisation process, where central and local government views are still not in agreement, it is difficult to see how decent work can be applied nationally. Thus, the minimum wage policy and trade union development are important in the overall development paradigm. Both ensure the existence of a rights based approach to development where workers are given rights to organize as well as earn a basic living. Nevertheless, the development of trade unions in developing countries is under threat from flexibilisation of the workplace in which jobs have become less and less secure. The minimum wage policy, however, is still viable because it covers all types of workers. At the very least, minimum wages provide a safety net wage that can prevent real wages from falling. The writer suggests that more studies should be conducted on the extent and effectiveness of trade union participation in minimum wage bargaining. In addition, further studies should be conducted on the effect of minimum wages and trade unions on non-standard or flexible workers. Flexible workers, whether they are fixed-term contract and outsourced workers, are becoming an important part of the global labour market and increasingly pose a challenge to the increasingly important role of trade unions in developing countries.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Trade unions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1608</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A gendered undertaking : the feminisation of after-death work in Aotearoa New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology, Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Watson, Bronwyn</field><field name="description">Long after women have successfully entered many other occupational fields once considered to be 'men's work' they have remained a small minority in after-death work in the funeral industry in Aotearoa New Zealand. Women and their contributions to the funeral industry have been excluded, marginalised and devalued. In the last decade, however, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of women funeral directors and embalmers. In the same decade, the occupational specialism of funeral celebrant, comprising a large majority of women, has been established to fulfil a growing demand for non-religious funeral ceremonies. This thesis examines the means by which men have excluded and marginalised women from the funeral industry in Aotearoa New Zealand. More importantly, it examines the ways women are successfully overcoming exclusion and marginalisation by men. To this end I analyse research material from a range of sources. These include: unstructured interviews with funeral directors, embalmers, celebrants, clerical workers and members of clergy; my observations from previous funeral industry research and fifteen years' experience as organist in the industry; plus data from the association magazines of the Funeral Directors Association of New Zealand. To develop a theoretical framework with which to explain how women are surmounting exclusion and marginalisation, I draw on two strands of literature that highlight different aspects of women's involvement in paid work. The first strand includes theories of gendered occupational control, focusing on both practice-based and discursive-based strategies of gendered closure. This strand reveals women's exclusion from, and their strategies for entering, the funeral industry. The second strand of literature focuses on theories of gendered organisational structures, culture and power, uncovering women's marginalisation within the funeral industry. There are five analytical chapters. The first two are largely historical, examining the masculinisation and commercialisation of after-death work, and the ways women and their contribution to after-death work have been devalued and made invisible. The third and fourth analytical chapters investigate men's and women's closure strategies in after-death work. The fifth is a discussion of the ways women promote and position their contribution to after-death work by claiming that, as women, they bring different values from men to after-death work. In this, they adopt discourses of new professionalism; resistant discourses invert the masculinist discourses of the old model of professionalism, valorising long denigrated 'feminine' attributes. I argue that the hierarchical gendered boundaries in the funeral industry stem from the early development of funeral firms in Aotearoa New Zealand as family firms, plus their failed attempts, throughout the twentieth century, to achieve professional status. In this, they reflect the patriarchal power of the masculinist projects of modernity, the society in which funeral director leaders established their professional project. Further, I argue that the failure of their professional project has, paradoxically, facilitated the men's continuing discrimination of women by leaving access to education in the industry's control. I also argue that the recent rise of women in the funeral industry reflects the growing feminisation of the public sphere, with a subsequent increase in women funeral industry clients, who bring different expectations and needs from those of men clients. Women after-death workers claim to facilitate the needs of women and men clients: they are able to do the work equally as well as men, while also drawing on skills they have learned from their experiences as women.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Funeral industry</field><field name="subject">Marginalisation of women</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370104 Urban sociology and community studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1609</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling community productivity, species abundance and richness in a naturalised pasture ecosystem : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Baisen</field><field name="description">This study focuses on modelling community productivity, species abundance and richness, and the impact of climate change and alternative phosphorous fertiliser application strategies on pasture productivity by integration of decision tree and regression modelling approaches with a geographical information system (GIS) in a naturalised hill-pasture ecosystem in the North Island, New Zealand, using data derived from research conducted on hill-pastures over the last several decades. The results indicated that the decision tree models had a high predictive capability and clearly revealed the relative importance of environmental and management factors in influencing community productivity, species abundance and richness. Spring rainfall was the most significant factor influencing annual pasture productivity in the North Island, while hill slope was the most significant factor influencing spring and winter pasture productivity. Annual P fertiliser input and autumn rainfall were the most significant factors influencing summer and autumn pasture productivity, respectively. For species functional group abundance, soil Olsen P was the most significant factor influencing the relative abundance of low fertility tolerance grasses (LFTG) and moss, while soil bulk density, slope and annual P fertiliser input were the most significant factors influencing the relative abundance of legume, high fertility response grasses (HFRG) and flatweeds, respectively. Legume abundance was the most significant factor influencing species richness in the hill-pasture. Species richness increased with an increase in legume abundance and showed a tendency for a hump-shaped response. Grazing animal species also had a significant effect on species richness; pasture grazed by sheep had more species than pasture grazed by cattle. Climate change scenarios of temperature increases of 1-2 &#176;C and rainfall changes of -20% to +20% would have a great impact (-46.2% to +51.9%) on pasture production in the North Island. Pasture in areas with relatively low rainfall had a higher response to increased P fertiliser input than pastures in areas with a relatively high rainfall. In conclusion, the integration of a GIS with decision tree and regression models in this study provided an approach for effective predictive modelling of community productivity, species abundance and richness in the hill-pasture. This modelling approach can also be used as a tool in pasture management such as in assessing the impact of climate change and alternative fertiliser management on pasture production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pasture productivity</field><field name="subject">Pasture fertilisation</field><field name="subject">Climate change effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1610</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saving soldiers the evolution of international military medical norms, 1815 to 1914</field><field name="creator">Jessica Jane Ellis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151443</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">2-Iodoxybenzoic Acid: Acidity Investigations and The Total Synthesis of 5,14-bis-epi-Spirovibsanin A</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Gallen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ibx, acidity, pka, oxidation, spirovibsanin a, diterpene, total synthesis, natural product, spirolactone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aetiology of chronic nephritis in Queensland.</field><field name="creator">Henderson, David Arthur.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">920501 Child Health</field><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The accountant and capital investment analysis under risk and uncertainty.</field><field name="creator">Meredith, G.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy -

At ovulation ovarian follicle cells respond to the luteinising hormone (LH) surge coordinating the final maturation, meiotic resumption and release of oocytes. Simultaneously, production of a unique &#8220;mucified&#8221; extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte through synthesis of Hyaluronan (HA) and HA cross-linking proteins produces an &#8220;expanded&#8221; and stabilised cumulus oocyte matrix with a specific composition, structure and function. In vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes is a procedure by which cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) are stimulated to produce cumulus matrix and undergo oocyte maturation ex vivo. In vitro maturation is a useful procedure for studying oocyte competence as well as offering health benefits for patients undergoing assisted reproduction. Oocytes derived from IVM have much lower developmental competence than in vivo matured oocytes, likely as a result of altered environmental conditions and gene expression leading to suboptimal maturation and/or inappropriate metabolic control in oocytes. Cumulus matrix expansion is widely used as an indicator of good oocyte developmental potential, however, the mechanism(s) that endow oocyte quality and how these may be influenced by the cumulus matrix are poorly understood. To better understand the process by which cumulus matrix is linked to the final stages of oocyte maturation, I undertook investigation of mouse COC matrix composition and function after in vivo maturation in comparison to IVM. The gene responsible for Hyaluronan synthesis, Has2, was not impaired under IVM conditions. In contrast, two key extracellular matrix proteins; Versican and Adamts1, which are normally selectively incorporated into periovulatory COCs in vivo, were greater than 10-fold reduced in IVM whether stimulated with Egf and/or FSH. This work is the first to show that commonly used IVM conditions result in altered gene expression in cumulus cells. Furthermore, the absence of Adamts1 and Versican suggest that COC matrix may be functionally insufficient. Although associated with good developmental potential, the function of the COC matrix in oocyte maturation is unknown. I assessed the properties of COC matrix that control metabolite supply to oocytes by examining transport of fluorescently labelled glucose and cholesterol across mouse COCs. Profound differences in the control of metabolite supply to oocytes in IVM were observed. In vivo matured complexes were capable of excluding glucose from the entire COC and cholesterol was excluded from oocytes. Conversely IVM COCs were more permissive to rapid equilibration of glucose and cholesterol concentrations across the complex and in oocytes. In fact both metabolites accumulated rapidly in IVM oocytes resulting in inverse gradient patterns of glucose and cholesterol abundance with highest concentrations accumulating in the oocyte after IVM vs highest concentrations surrounding the COC after in vivo maturation conditions. As oocytes are highly sensitive to high glucose my results indicate that metabolic balance in IVM may be disrupted due to impaired molecular filtration properties of the mucified COC matrix that controls supply of hydrophilic and lipophylic substrates. Importantly these novel findings can explain the glucose sensitivity of IVM oocytes and identifies a mechanism by which IVM may lead to poorer oocyte developmental competence. To translate these findings into the improvement of IVM I generated recombinant expression plasmid constructs for several Adamts1 and Versican functional domains. The efficacy of Versican as an IVM supplement that activates cumulus cell signal transduction was proved in principle, by showing enhanced COC matrix expansion when added to mouse IVM cultures. Similar mechanisms are likely to be functional in human COCs since I demonstrated VERSICAN and ADAMTS1 expression in human in vivo matured cumulus and granulosa cells. This work has advanced our understanding of oocyte maturation and will lead to improvements in IVM and healthier outcomes from reproductive therapies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oocyte maturation; cumulus cells; mural granulosa cells; ovary; assisted reproductive technology; extracellular matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50728</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the development and hormonal regulation of the ovarian lymphatic vasculature.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Hannah Mary</field><field name="description">The ovary provides a niche environment where female germ cells (or oocytes) are generated, stored within follicles and later matured in preparation for use during reproductive life. Following an extensive period of quiescence, which in human, may be up to forty years; the follicle surrounding the oocyte begins to grow, promoting maturation of the oocyte, and culminating in the expulsion of a fully mature oocyte in preparation for fertilisation. These events occur cyclically as part of the menstrual (or estrus) cycle and involve extensive remodelling of both the follicle and its surrounding extracellular tissue. Cyclic follicle activation and growth is also associated with concurrent remodelling of the blood vasculature within the ovary, specifically the vessels surrounding the growing follicle. These blood vascular remodelling changes are well explored and have been demonstrated to be necessary for follicle growth, hormone synthesis, ovulation and for the development and function of the corpus luteum. Physiologically, the lymphatic vasculature is known to closely interact with the blood vasculature and plays a number of important physiological roles including the return of extra-vascular fluid to the blood circulation, and in turn, maintenance of systemic fluid homeostasis. Additionally the lymphatic network is required for the trafficking of immune cells from the periphery to lymph nodes; during the initiation of an immune response and for the absorption of lipids and lipid soluble vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract. The lymphatic vasculature develops and functions concomitantly with the blood vasculature; however unlike the blood vasculature, the aetiology of lymphatic vasculature within the ovary is unknown. It is unclear whether lymphatic remodelling events occur in association with folliculogenesis and are necessary for fertility, as is seen with the blood vasculature. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the establishment and remodelling of the lymphatic vasculature within the ovary, I undertook expansive characterisation of its development and hormonal regulation. I exploited both hormonal manipulation and a known model of disrupted ovarian lymphatic development, the Adamts1 null mouse line, to examine the mechanisms controlling ovarian lymphangiogenesis. Quantitative morphometric analysis of vessel size and number in postnatal mouse ovary revealed that the ovarian lymphatic vasculature develops postnatally between day 8.5 and 12.5, and in synchrony with induction of ovarian CYP19a1 (Aromatase); the time when secondary follicles become FSH-responsive and estrogenic. The establishment of the lymphatic vasculature was also associated with the induction of pro-lymphangiogenic growth factors Vegfc and Vegfd, and their receptor, Vegfr3. Formation of ovarian lymphatics required the matrix-remodelling protease Adamts1, since ovaries from Adamts1&#8315;/&#8315; mice failed to undergo normal lymphatic vascular development. FSH promoted remodelling of the existing lymphatic vascular maturation by increasing lymphatic vessel size in normal (Adamts1&#8314;/&#8315;) ovaries, and promoted the expansion of a new lymphatic vascular network by increasing vessel number and size in Adamts1&#8315;/&#8315; ovaries. These vessel changes were also associated with the induction of prolymphangiogenic factors, Vegfc and Vegfd, as well as their receptor, Vegfr3 providing a mechanistic explanation for the hormonal mediated lymphangiogenesis. The concurrent establishment of the lymphatic vasculature with the first postnatal induction of ovarian Aromatase, and the hormone-regulated lymphangiogenesis suggests that a hormonal communication, likely estrogen, may synchronise lymphangiogenesis with folliculogenesis. Like FSH, exogenous estradiol was able to promote the expansion of a new lymphatic vascular network by increasing vessel number and size in Adamts1&#8315;/&#8315; ovaries. Additionally, FSH-analog eCG was able to enhance ovarian lymphangiogenesis during the window of lymphatic establishment (postnatal development of Adamts1 null), whilst inhibition of the production of estradiol using the Aromatase inhibitor Letrozole, during this same window failed to have any effect. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between ovarian lymphatic development and remodelling and folliculogenesis. The present studies reveal that the ovary undergoes lymphatic vascular remodelling, described elsewhere as adult or secondary lymphangiogenesis and that this process involves hormonal contributions from FSH and estradiol, as well as the extracellular matrix protease, Adamts1. This work provides the first evidence of a malleable lymphatic system and a model for regulation of normal adult lymphangiogenesis, and may one day be used to explore ways in which to regenerate damaged vessels to cure lymphatic diseases and disorders. These results also significantly advanced the understanding of the tightly regulated processes controlling fluid dynamics within the ovary.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lymphatic; ovary; hormone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of oxidation reaction kinetics during an air injection process.</field><field name="creator">Das, Shyamol Chandra</field><field name="description">Air injection is an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process in which compressed air is injected into a high temperature, light-oil reservoir. The oxygen in injected air is intended to react with a fraction of reservoir oil at elevated temperature resulting in in-situ generation of flue gases and steam, which, in turn, mobilize and drive the oil ahead towards the producing wells. To understand and determine the feasibility of the air injection process application to a given reservoir, it is necessary to understand the oxidation behaviour of the crude oil. The aim of this study is to screen two Australian light-oil reservoirs; Kenmore Oilfield, Eromanga Basin, and another Australian onshore oil and gas field &#8220;B&#8221;* for air injection EOR process, and to understand the oxidation reaction kinetics during air injection. It is carried out by the thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric (TGA/DSC) studies to investigate the oxidation mechanism during an air injection process. There has not been any TGA/DSC evaluation conducted to date with regard to air injection for Australian light-oil reservoirs. A series of thermal tests was performed to investigate the oxidation behaviour of two selected reservoirs in both air and oxygen environments. The first step undertaken in this study is thermogravimetric and calorimetric characterization of crude oils to (i) identify the temperature range over which the oil reacts with oxygen, (ii) examine the oxidation behaviour within the temperature identified, and (iii) evaluate the mass loss characteristics during the oxidation. This study also examines the effect of pressure on oxidation at different temperature ranges and the effect of core material (rock cutting) on oxidation reactions. Finally, kinetic data are calculated from thermal tests results by literature described method. Kenmore and Field B both are high temperature and light-oil reservoirs. Hydrocarbon distribution indicates that Kenmore oil contains 84 mole% of lower carbon number n-C&#8325; - n-C&#8321; &#8323; compounds. Reservoir B oil also contains a substantial amount (i.e., 95 mole %) of lower carbon number n-C&#8324;  - C&#8321; &#8329; compounds. These lighter components may contribute favourably towards efficient oxidation. However, a high content of lighter ends in the oil may also result in a lower fuel load. Generally, low molecular weight oil gives fastest mass loss from heavy crude oil. Thermal tests on Kenmore oil showed two distinct exothermic reactivity regions in temperatures of 200-340&#176;C and 360-450&#176;C, with a 85-95% mass loss when the temperature reached 450&#176;C. Reservoir B oil showed a wider exotherm range between approximately 180&#176;C-260&#176;C with 90-95% mass loss by temperature 350&#176;C. In the high temperature range, the combustion reactions of Reservoir B oil are weaker than Kenmore oil. This is due to insufficient fuel available for oxidations in high temperature region. Reservoir B oil has more chance to auto ignite; but it has less sustainability to the ignition process. Based on the sustainability study of the ignition process, between the two reservoirs, Kenmore is the better candidate for air injection. Based on the thermal tests, it is concluded that for light-oil oxidation, vaporization is the dominant physical phenomenon. At low temperature range, the addition of the core material enhanced the exothermic reactions of the oil. The elevated pressure accelerated the bond scission reactions. The largest amount and highest rate of energy generation occurred at the low temperature range. Activation energies (E) are calculated from thermal test results and the value of &#8216;E&#8217; in oil-with-core combined tests is smaller than the oil-only test. This indicates that the rock material has a positive impact on the combustion process. Moreover, the compositional analysis result addresses the composition of oils, which can help understand the oxidation behaviour of light-oils. * For confidentiality reasons, the field name is coded as Field B at the request of the operating company.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">air injection; reaction kinetics; EOR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60192</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersal biology of Orobanche ramosa in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Ginman, Emma L.</field><field name="description">Orobanche ramosa L. is an annual, parasitic weed present in the western Murray-Mallee region of South Australia. A quarantine zone was established to encompass all known infestations, and has been adjusted over time as new infestations have been discovered. The movement of fodder, machinery, grain and straw, horticultural crops, livestock, and soil is controlled by strict quarantine procedures, to prevent further spread across the landscape. O. ramosa presents a unique situation for weed managers: plants are obligate parasites, relying entirely on broadleaved hosts for their water and nutrition; and seeds are tiny (0.3 mm), produced in large numbers (up to 100 000 seeds per plant), and are long-lived, persisting in the soil seed bank for up to 13 years. The dispersal vectors for O. ramosa in South Australia are the focus of this Master&#8217;s thesis. Two dispersal vectors were chosen for investigation: sheep and wind. Sheep were examined as possible vector for seeds, both via the gut (internal transport, or endozoochory) and via adhesion on the external surface of the animal (external transport, or epizoochory). Internal transport via sheep was investigated with a classic gut-passage experiment, which showed a peak in excretion of weed seeds at day 2, reducing to zero seeds excreted at day 8, and a half-life of 2 days. Two phases of external transport on sheep was studied: attachment and retention. Attachment was confirmed by finding seeds on the body wool and feet of sheep that had been kept for 7 days on soil with an O. ramosa seedbank. Seed retention was confirmed by placing seeds onto the body and still finding them in wool samples after 7 days. Wind was the other dispersal vector investigated for O. ramosa. A survey of natural wind dispersal was conducted, which confirmed wind as a vector and allowed trap design to be tested. Then a portable field-based wind tunnel was used to investigate the effects of ground cover (bare ground and cereal stubble) and wind speed (low, medium and high) on wind dispersal of O. ramosa seeds. For the stubble treatments, more seeds were trapped within the tunnel, and on bare ground more seeds were trapped exiting the tunnel. Importantly, the data showed that low wind speeds readily move O. ramosa seeds, and that the seeds are capable of aerodynamic lift in the wind profile. Results are discussed in the context of dispersal biology, quarantine procedures, and future work that would further refine knowledge of likely dispersal vectors for O. ramosa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seed dispersal; Orobanche; wind dispersal; gut passage; weed quarantine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60193</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of DNA copy number imbalance using array CGH.</field><field name="creator">Nicholl, Jillian</field><field name="description">The association of constitutional chromosome imbalance in patients with intellectual disability with or without related dysmorphism and malformations is well established. The resolution of conventional cytogenetic examination is limited to imbalances of 5-10Mb. Patients with characteristic phenotypes which allude to a specific microdeletion or duplication syndrome may be investigated using locus specific fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH). Subtelomere FISH, a recently new improvement for cytogenetics screening, detects subtelomeric rearrangements in around 6% of patients with idiopathic disability. However it is evident that for these patients, most do not have a recurrent pattern of dysmorphism or malformations suggesting imbalance in a particular chromosome region. Array CGH has the potential to detect chromosome imbalances beyond that of current technology allowing the whole genome can be screened in a single hybridisation at a resolution limited only by the genomic distance between the arrayed target clones. The aim of this study was to develop a custom whole genome array and utilize this array to screen a number of diverse patient groups. Rather than immediately begin with the development of a whole genome array a smaller pilot study was initiated, in so enabling the efficacy of the methodology to be tested. A small clinical/ subtelomere array was designed and constructed to screen for cytogenetic imbalances within the first 5Mb of each chromosome end (excluding acrocentric chromosomes) together with the number of known clinically significant regions. This clinical/subtelomere array (chapter 3), was ulilised to map the extent of deletion and/or duplication in patients with previously determined subtelomere abnormalities. This was followed with the screening of a small group of patients with idiopathic intellectual disability (chapter 4). Novel Copy number changes were identified together with a number of changes determined to be non-pathogenic variants. The methodology used in the utilization of this array could determine copy changes in patients, however it became clearly evident that the effective resolution was compromised when a number of clones were shown to map to other sites of the genome or cross hybridise to multiple sites. With this knowledge the next stage of the project, a whole genome array, primarily constructed from a FISH validated clone set, reduced the possibility of mapping discrepancies. These FISH mapped clones did not give a even genomic coverage. All clones from this set were mapped using Ensembl resources. Any identified gaps (greater than 1Mb) were covered using clones from a second clone set (32K), giving a resolution of ~0.2-1Mb. Three diverse groups of patients were screened using the whole genome array. Using a novel scoring system which evaluated degree of intellectual disability/developmental delay, dysmorphism, presence of malformations and the presence of an apparently balanced cytogenetic rearrangement, twenty five patients with idiopathic disability were assessed. Four novel copy number changes were determined of which three were determined likely to contribute to the phenotype of the patient. The fourth patient is under investigation. Chapter 6 saw the application of the whole genome array to a second patient group; medically terminated pregnancies, in utero fetal deaths or newborn infants with one or more facial dysmorphism or fetal malformation. One potentially pathogenic copy number change was ascertained from this study. The third patient group, those with retractable epilepsy (chapter 7) showed two copy number changes both of which will require further follow up and investigation, including screening with a higher density array platform. The screening of more than seventy varied patients has shown the efficacy of these two custom platforms, to detect previously undetermined copy number changes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">array CGH; intellectual disability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60194</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of typically developing and atypically developing ToM.</field><field name="creator">Harman-Smith, Yasmin</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Theory of Mind (ToM) in relation to the areas of language and cognitive development. The thesis explores both popular and alternate theories of ToM and how they account for the important relationships between language and theory of mind. It examines the theories in the context of published ToM findings as well as the findings from three studies conducted by the author. The first study took the form of a pilot study which re-analysed data, collected for the author's honours project, from a small group of children with (n = 10) and without autism (n = 10). In each diagnostic group (autism and no autism) children were divided into two groups, those passing a ToM task and those failing a ToM task. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the underlying language and cognitive skills required to succeed on ToM tasks are the same for children with and without autism. The key finding of the study was that for both the children with and without autism, those who passed the ToM task performed better on all the developmental measures, although only the difference in language ability was statistically significant. The second study expanded on the pilot study, examining the relationship in typically developing 4 and 6-year-old children, between ToM, language, cognitive development, and subtractive reasoning. The study's aim was to examine the developmental structure underlying ToM using factor analysis. The results indicated that for 4-year-old children the most important skill for ToM success was language, but that for 6-year-old children ToM success was more strongly related to subtractive reasoning ability. The findings of the study also raised the question of whether presentation method for ToM tasks impacted on task difficulty. A final study therefore examined the effect of presentation mode 2-dimensional versus 3-dimensional, on the success of typically developing 4-year-old children on the ToM task battery. The findings indicated that tasks presented in cartoon format were more difficult than tasks presented with dolls and props. Reliability and validity of common ToM tasks and new ToM test batteries are discussed. Alternative conceptions of ToM in relation to social interaction are considered.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of mind; child development; social development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60195</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Augmented reality visualisation for mobile robot developers</field><field name="creator">Collett, Toby H. J.</field><field name="description">Developer interactions with robots during the testing and debugging phases of robot development are more complex than and distinct from general software application development. One of the primary differences is the need to understand the robot's view of the environment and the inconsistencies between this and the actual environment. Augmented reality (AR) provides an ideal way to achieve this, allowing robot program data to be displayed in context with the real world. This allows for easy comparison by the developer, highlighting the cause for any bugs in the robot behaviour. An AR debugging space is created in this work that allows the developer to have this enhanced understanding of the robot's world-view, thus improving developer efficiency.  Over the past decade robots have begun to move out of industrial assembly lines and into environments that must be shared with human users. Many of the tasks that we wish robots to perform in these environments require close interaction and collaboration with human users. The move away from the constrained environment of a production line means that the tasks required of robots are more varied, their operating environment is far more complex and unpredictable, and safety can no longer be achieved through isolation of the robot. The result of these influences has been to change robot programming from a simple task of instructing the robot to perform a sequence of steps to an open ended challenge of specifying dynamic interactions that robot developers are still coming to terms with. Robot development is more than just design and code entry and a broader approach to improving robot development is needed. One of the founding principles of this thesis is that robot development should be approached as a human-robot interaction issue, this particularly applies to the testing and debugging phases of the development.  The nature of the robot platform, the tasks the robot is required to perform and the environments that robots work within are significantly different from those of the desktop application. Hence robot developers need a tailored tool chain that focuses on this unique combination of issues. Current robot programming research is dominated by robot APIs and frameworks, leaving support tools to be developed in an ad hoc manner by developers as features are required. This leads to disjointed tools that have minimal feature sets; tools that generally have poor portability when applied to other robot developments. This work examines the needs of the developer in terms of a general purpose robot visualisation tool.  One of the fundamental requirements of a general purpose robot visualisation tool is that a set of stock visualisations must be available for the developer. A prerequisite to providing these is to have a set of standard interfaces to provide the visualisations for. The open source robot framework Player/Stage was used throughout this work to provide standardised access to robot hardware. As part of this research the author has contributed heavily to the Player/Stage project, particularly as one of the key developers of the 2.0 release of Player. This new release simplifies Player development and increases the ease of maintenance of Player drivers and the efficiency of the server core.  To evaluate the benefits of AR visualisation an intelligent debugging space was developed, which runs as a permanent installation in a robotic development lab providing an enhanced view of the robot's behaviour to the developer. The space is capable of automatically detecting the presence of robots and displaying visualisations of the standard interfaces of the robot, such as its sensors and effectors. The debugging space also allows the developer to create custom renderings, leveraging the developer's ability to determine the most salient items of their code and display these.  A set of representative case studies was carried out using the debugging space for testing and debugging. These studies showed that AR provides an opportunity to understand the type of errors that are encountered during debugging. Debugging is essentially a process of elimination and by understanding the type of error developers can quickly eliminate large sets of potential bug sources, focusing on the sections of code that are causing the bug and therefore substantially reducing debugging time. The implemented system also shows that AR provides an important stepping stone between simulation environments and the real world.  This thesis contributes the novel approach of applying AR to developer interactions with robots. The use of AR has been shown to have significant benefits for the robot developer, enhancing their understanding of the robot's world-view and hence reducing debugging time. As part of the work a flexible AR visualisation tool was developed with close integration to the Player/Stage project. This tool creates an intelligent debugging space where developers can exploit the benefits of the AR visualisation with minimal overhead.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robotics</field><field name="subject">Augmented Reality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1510</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What underpins success in a health promoting school in Northeastern Thailand? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Chamusri, Somsaowanuch</field><field name="description">A Health Promoting School (HPS) approach is now widely accepted internationally, with a focus on children&#8217;s health, the school curriculum, and whole school environment. In Thailand, the health and well-being of children is a fundamental value. HPS programmes have been implemented in schools as a strategy to focus on young people&#8217;s health. A number of barriers to successful HPS have been identified. While there is international evidence to show the steps and the key factors in creating successful HPS, little is known about successful HPS in the Thai context, in particular, in Northeastern Thailand which has been classified the poorest region. Ethnographic methods were used to examine what understanding of the meaning of HPS is necessary for a successful school, and how all those involved acted from the adoption of the HPS programmes by the local school until it achieved HPS status. A rural school which was successful in a HPS programme was selected, in Mahasarakham province, Northeastern Thailand. The data were obtained through participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and ethnographic records, and data analysis took place simultaneously with data collection. In this study, Lofland&#8217;s strategy for the analysis of the structure of human interaction was used. A variety of techniques for improving and documenting the credibility of the study such as prolonged engagement, persistent observation, and triangulation were used. This research revealed that the informants&#8217; views reflected diverse understandings of the meaning of HPS. Those views were based on their experiences of HPS which differed according to the degree of participation, different levels of knowledge about HPS, and in the roles they played in the implementation of HPS in the school. Thai culture and school ethos influenced the success of HPS. Community participation was also crucial in supporting the school&#8217;s achievement. Key factors that underpinned success are identified. Implications of the findings for the HPS programme, health professionals, the school and community are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child health</field><field name="subject">health promoting school</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321210 Community child health</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/817</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The response to and recovery from the 2004 Eastern Bay of Plenty flood event : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Emergency Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Busby, Eric</field><field name="description">Incident Management Systems used in New Zealand have their origins in the fire-fighting organisations of the United States of America in the 1970&#8217;s. They began in an atmosphere of disciplined quasi-military emergency response organizations. Emergency management research, theory and practice have since evolved to incorporate comprehensive facets acknowledging disasters are about people, individually and collectively and their environment. Emergency Management now includes addressing psycho-social aspects. New Zealand emergency services adopted the Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) as a result of a requirement following the Cave Creek disaster of 1995, where a multi- agency response to the event was found to be unsatisfactorily managed. Emergency management in the modern era now requires the orchestration of many and varied agencies and organisations including government and non-government organisations. These organisations are not necessarily suited to command type management styles and during a recovery phase of an incident, an approach involving a coordination style is more appropriate than a command style. An examination of the 2004 eastern Bay of Plenty flood event highlights that improved coordination by using a suitable incident management system benefits the response and recovery process. The Eastern Bay of Plenty community has social and cultural characteristics that impact on the effectiveness of emergency management outcomes. An incident management system that improves communication within the multi-agency organisation and between an emergency management organisation and the disaster-affected communities contributes to overall trauma reduction by stress reduction and facilitating early support and interventions. This allows where necessary, for modern emergency management to use systems that can utilise the unique community cultures, structures and networks that form the dynamic communities that they serve. If disasters magnify pre-existing social and community problems then the incident management system model used in a disaster can determine the degree of magnification.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Incident Management System</field><field name="subject">Disaster relief</field><field name="subject">Bay of Plenty, New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1524</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Social Networks in High Performance Football Coaching</field><field name="creator">Joseph Occhino</field><field name="description">Abstract Increasing global interest in coaching science research has resulted in a greater recognition of the complexities and dynamics existing in the coaching process (Cushion, Armour, &amp; Jones, 2003). Associated with the dynamic and complex nature of the coaching process are the many social relationships that operate within this process. A high performance coach&#8217;s network is often associated with athletes, officials, support staff and administrators. In essence, coaches form dynamic social networks (DSN; (Mallett, Rossi, &amp; Tinning, 2007) that are paramount to developing their coaching practice, and therefore their coaching knowledge. The aim of this project was to understand how high performance football coaches (HPFC) learn. The research questions were as follows: &#8226; What are the major sources of information for HPFC? &#8226; What sources of information are most valuable to the HPFC? &#8226; What role does the interaction with other coaches&#8217; play in developing knowledge? In order to better understand the nature of coach interactions in developing knowledge it is useful to consider the notions of communities of practice (CoP) (Wenger, 1998), networks of practice (NoP) (Nichani &amp; Hung, 2002), informal knowledge networks (IKN) (Allee, 2000) and dynamic social networks (DSN) (Mallett, et al., 2007). This qualitative research was conducted with six high performance football coaches (HPFC) in Australia using semi-structured interviews. Each interview was transcribed and analysed into meaning units through the process of triangular consensus. The coaches in this sample did not display a fully functioning CoP, IKN, or NoP. The HPFCs failed to display the critical element of a joint enterprise. Mutual engagement was partially reported between coaches of the same team but was not reported between opposition coaches. The coaches reported the final element of a shared repertoire. Nichani &amp; Hung&#8217;s (2002) notion of a NoP and Allee&#8217;s (2000) research on IKN were considered as possible social networks to describe the coaching context. These coaches did not develop relationships that could be characterised as a NoP. The data suggests that the development of knowledge through face-to-face interactions with other people was valued over use of Internet exchanges and chat rooms. There was evidence to suggest the formation of a coaches&#8217; IKN, however it is proposed that this was not the major source for these coaches in developing knowledge. Most importantly it was found that HPFC in the Australian context are engaged in a DSN. It was reported by the coaches in this study that their interactions are dynamic, in that they change throughout their careers to the extent that their people of influence can be numerous; this is due to two key findings. The nature of the work of HPFC is highly contested and thus the information and knowledge is sacred. This is a barrier for information and knowledge transfer and can inhibit learning. In addition finding a person of influence is a lengthy process as it can take years to build mutual trust and respect. By understanding how coaches learn their craft through their interactions with others, coach development could potentially assist coaches through the learning process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coaching knowledge, communities of practice, knowledge networks, football coaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186449</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary divergence of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A/B and functional implications</field><field name="creator">Siew Ping Han</field><field name="description">The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are a group of proteins intitially characterised in the late 1980&#8217;s by their presence in complexes that form on nascent RNA transcripts. This definition was purely operational, and was based on protein isolation techniques available at that time. Since then, the tendency to refer to and view the hnRNPs as a protein family has become increasingly prevalent, although there has been no systematic sequence- or structure-based study of their evolutionary history. While the hnRNPs share some structural characteristics (modular structure, presence of RNA-binding domains) and functional properties (binding to RNA, involvement in multiple steps of RNA processing), these criteria also apply to other types of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), such as the SR and ELAV families of proteins. Thus, we have adopted a more methodical and rigorous approach to the classification of hnRNPs and other RBPs, through the phylogenetic analysis of their sequences and domains. Besides establishing phylogenetic relationships and simplifying nomenclature, studying the evolutionary divergence of the hnRNPs is important for understanding their functional features. The hnRNP A/B subfamily is comprised of paralogues A1, A2/B1, A3 and A0, which exhibit a high level of similarity at both the sequence and structural level. While they are often treated as functional homologues, they are not functionally identical. Hence, we undertook a detailed comparison of their sequences, and found that the introduction of novel splicing signals or mutation of existing sequence elements has led to changes in alternative splicing patterns between the paralogues, which may affect the regulation of their expression and their RNA binding properties. In addition, we also investigated species-specific alternative splicing of the hnRNPs A/B, which has significant implications for the interpretation of current research, since different research groups tend to use different model organisms in their experiments. Hence, exploration of the sequence divergence of the hnRNPs A/B has provided some clues as to how their functional differences arose, and also highlighted the need to take species-specific splicing into consideration. Alternative splicing can create functional variation not only between paralogues, but also between splice variants. hnRNP A2/B1, which has a well-established role in mRNA trafficking in neuronal cells, has four spliceoforms. In order to study the contribution of each isoform to this process, we investigated isoform-specific variations in intracellular localisation, and expression in different developmental stages and species. We found that in rat, minor isoform A2b was the predominant isoform in the cytoplasm, and may be the key player in mRNA trafficking. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering individual isoforms (including those expressed in low abundance) when studying the function of alternatively spliced proteins, especially when the function is restricted to a particular subcellular compartment. In addition to its cytoplasmic role in mRNA trafficking, hnRNP A2/B1, and the other hnRNPs A/B, have multiple nuclear functions, including packaging of nascent transcripts, nuclear export of mRNA, regulation of alternative splicing and telomere maintenance. These processes take place in discrete regions within the nucleus, and thus we examined the subnuclear distribution of the hnRNPs A/B. We found that hnRNP A1 had a localisation pattern distinct from that of A2/B1 and A3, and that these patterns were spatially and temporally regulated. Hence, the evolutionary divergence of the hnRNPs A/B has affected the localisation, expression and splicing patterns of these proteins, which we have examined at multiple levels, including comparisons across all hnRNPs, within the hnRNP A/B paralogues, and between the hnRNP A2/B1 splice variants. As the hnRNPs A/B are involved in almost every step in RNA processing, this functional diversity has significant implications for transcriptomic complexity. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of taking species- and isoform-specific differences into account when investigating protein function. In conclusion, this study of the hnRNPs A/B provides a conceptual framework for exploring the relationships between sequence, structural and functional divergence, which may be applicable to protein families in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">hnRNPs</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">alternative splicing</field><field name="subject">mRNA trafficking</field><field name="subject">subnuclear localisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ON ENHANCING IT BUSINESS VALUE: SUSTAINING ORGANISATIONAL CAPABILITIES WITH CO-CREATED DYNAMIC RESOURCES</field><field name="creator">Acklesh Prasad</field><field name="description">The rapid advancement and penetration of information technology (IT), amid continued questions over its benefits, has resulted in research efforts to understand the extent to which IT resources contribute to organisational performance. There is little question that the presence of IT contributes to organisational performance. Our understanding of how and where IT contributes to value in organisations, however, is limited. Current IT business value research advances the notion that firm&#8217;s IT-related capabilities ability to leverage their IT resources explains the IT-related performance differences across firms. Understanding the nature of the IT-related capabilities, and their relationship with IT resources can provide a better understanding of how organisations can make better use of their IT resources. IT resources are dynamic and change at a rapid pace. Current IT business value research suggests the firm&#8217;s IT-related capabilities at a point in time can source value from the IT resources. However, firms IT-related capabilities must demonstrate parallel dynamics to maximise their influence on their IT resources. In this dynamic resource relationship environment, firm&#8217;s ability to sustain a level of influence on their IT resources will determine the extent of IT resources&#8217; value-creating ability. Using the resource-based view of the firm that suggest an organisation is a bundle of resources, and using a complementary theoretical lens, this study introduces a higher-level resource, co-created by combining two or more complementary resources. This higher-level resource is capable of contributing to business value on its own, and importantly, can help organisations sustain their existing IT-related capabilities. The sustainable IT-related capabilities will have a better influence on the IT resources and will source better IT-related business value. This higher-level resource can also help with the timing of IT investments, and can provide an environment where a firm&#8217;s technical IT skills can better integrate the IT resources into the business processes. On measurement of organisational performance, this study suggests that a unique combination of organisational resources creates an efficient and effective internal environment that then becomes a powerful tool to enhance the key external process of customer service. Such enhancements in process-level efficiency and effectiveness will carry forward to be recognised in overall firm-level performance. This study develops and tests a model that assesses the association between the two generic IT resources (IT investment and technical IT skills), three IT-related capabilities (top management commitment, shared organisational knowledge, and flexible IT infrastructure), and internal process-level performance. It also assesses whether the IT-Usage Platform, a higher-level co-created resource, on its own associates with, and enhances the generic IT resources&#8217; and IT-related capabilities&#8217; association with internal process-level performance. The study also proposes that improvement in internal process-level performance will be positively associated with external process-level performance of customer service. Firms that improve their internal and external process performance should also improve their firm-level performance. The results, as hypothesised, failed to reject the non-association between the generic IT resources and the internal process-level performance. The study, as predicted, found a positive association between the three IT-related capabilities, IT-Usage Platform, and the internal process-level performance. The IT-Usage Platform indeed enhances the association between the IT-related capabilities and internal process-level performance. The results also suggest that the association between the technical IT skills and internal process-level performance improves in the presence of the IT-Usage Platform. Firms&#8217; improved internal process-level performance also relates to improvement in external process-level performance. Improvement in the internal-external process performance also contributes to performance at the firm level. For research, this study demonstrates that the complementarity and the resource-based view theories allow inclusion of a greater variety of resources in a bundle of capable resources that could be a source of IT-related business value. The complementary theoretical lens also enables one to consider firms&#8217; higher-level resources, co-created from complementary resources. The result is a robust model with the flexibility to consider other forms of resource interactions that sustain firms existing IT-related capabilities. The model also enables comparison of IT and other organisational resources on a level-platform and allows for a deeper understanding of how organisations can better leverage their IT resources. The study also presents the internal-external coordination path of IT-related value creation. For decision makers this study reinforces the importance of the concept of a coordinated IT-related change to secure value from their IT investments. It also presents decision makers with a visual IT business value path from internal process benefits to external process benefits, and finally to firm-level benefits. This study suggests all organisational resources, through various combinations, could be a source of IT-related business value. Future research can consider resources that are at the boundary of capable/non-capable resources to evaluate whether firms various resource arrangements can make these resources more valuable in sourcing IT-related business value. This research also provides strong theoretical arguments to consider other higher-level factors that may have the potential to sustain firms existing IT-related capabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information technology (IT)</field><field name="subject">business value</field><field name="subject">IT-related capabilities</field><field name="subject">IT-Usage Platform</field><field name="subject">business process performance</field><field name="subject">firm-level performance</field><field name="subject">resource-based view</field><field name="subject">complementarity theory</field><field name="subject">dynamic capabilities</field><field name="subject">internal-external process coordination</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209932</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kudoid parasites: species definition and specificities</field><field name="creator">Mieke Burger</field><field name="description">Kudoid parasites are common in marine fish and their affects range from relatively benign to pathogenic. They are notorious in the seafood industry for spoiling fish meat, either by muscle liquefaction or by producing unsightly macroscopic cysts. Kudoids also infect several other tissues such as brain, heart, gills, connective tissue, intestinal smooth muscle, and epithelia. Since the revised classification of the Kudoidae in 2004, kudoid myxospores have a range of shapes, but with two main characteristics: they have four or more spore valves with the equivalent number of polar capsules. With relatively few morphological traits to base kudoid species descriptions, DNA has proven to be increasingly useful to specifically diagnose infections. However, to properly utilise genetic information, there is a need to understand how genetics relates to the biological characteristics of species. This will ensure the genetic markers used are appropriate for species characterisation. This project aimed to develop an understanding of how biological characteristics including morphology, tissue tropism, host specificity, and geographic distribution correlate with genetic relatedness of kudoid species, and how this information could be employed to facilitate diagnosis and characterisation of species. A taxonomic investigation of kudoid isolates, mostly from the east coast of Queensland, Australia, was conducted using information on host identity, locality, infection status, tissue of infection and histological response to infection. Together with spore morphology and DNA relationships, comparisons were made with existing data from literature. Forty-three small subunit and 68 large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences were generated from kudoid isolates for this project. The two gene regions showed similar relationships amongst the kudoids, however the genetic variability between closely related species was less conserved in the large subunit, and showed superior species resolution that correlated with subtle morphological differences of spores. Broadly speaking, genetic relatedness of kudoids is closest for species infecting the same type of tissue with similar spore morphology. Within these tissue/morphology groups, some relationships were emerging from genetic correlations with pathology, however there are weaknesses in utilising this characteristic since pathology may change with host species or host age. Similar relationships to pathology were seen from geographic locality; however, the limited number of areas that genetic data originates from may have introduced some bias. Lastly, there were very few genetic relationships that correlated with host relatedness. The taxonomic affinities of the new kudoid isolates lead to the characterisation of six novel kudoid species and four additional host-parasite combinations. The investigation into these new species highlighted the broad host ranges and geographic distribution of some kudoid species. Genetic mixing of kudoid species populations from the east coast of Queensland, Australia with Japan was noted. For example, Kudoa amamiensis was discovered from carangid and pomacentrid fish from Queensland, increasing the host range from eight (seven from Japan, one from north Queensland) to 11 host species. Also, geographic distribution was extended to Heron Island on the south Great Barrier Reef (Queensland). The distribution did not extend to rocky temperate reefs further south. Another example is Kudoa yasunagai which was previously recorded from four fish species in Japan and one from the Philippines. Now the distribution has been extended to North Stradbroke Island in Southern Queensland from three additional host species. The connection was made between these host isolates with the assistance of DNA and a novel way of analysing morphological data in species that have variable morphotypes i.e. different numbers of polar capsules in the spores. It was confirmed that the dominant morphotype can vary between different hosts and even host samples of the one species. Genetic data has also proven useful in the determination of host range. An analysis of kudoid host specificity showed just over two thirds of the described kudoid species have been recorded from a single host; the remainder have been recorded from two to 38 host species. By using DNA data, 17 new hosts were recorded for K. thalassomi (total 18 hosts). The new hosts came from six different host families, but these fish shared the same habitat on the Great Barrier Reef. Other high host range kudoid species may be disproportionately broad as similar morphological species may have been misidentified from some hosts. For example, the host range of K. thyrsites (38) is likely to represent a species complex that may be split pending further genetic analyses. From this study, it has been reinforced that a holistic approach to species definition is important. Genetic analysis has become a particularly valuable tool; however, in conjunction with biological data such as spore morphology, pathology, host range, and geographic distribution, our understanding of kudoid parasites becomes more robust and provides important knowledge for diagnostics and aquaculture management. In the future, significant improvements in kudoid understanding will coincide with the solving of kudoid life cycles and transmission patterns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kudoa, species definition, genetic relatedness, morphology, host specificity, Myxosporea, parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209935</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Morphosyntax of Tharifith Berber</field><field name="creator">Abdelhak El Hankari</field><field name="description">Abstract: This dissertation investigates the syntax and also some aspects of the morphology of Tharifith Berber (such as, the inflectional classes of nouns and the Construct State) within the Distributed Morphology framework (Halle &amp; Marantz 1993, et al.). One of its main objectives is to demonstrate how morphology could be brought within the range of syntax. This view becomes apparent when inflectional morphemes which project in the syntax are also used to derive words. Contrary to what has always been reported, that Berber is an unquestionable VSO language, I show that Tharifith has now shifted to a Topic-Initial configurational system. This claim is based on two pieces of evidence: (1) the SVO order is preferred over VSO, (2) when the object is a clitic both the verb and the clitic are required to be in the initial position of the clause. I propose an account arguing that the two alternations instantiate a Topic-fronting phenomenon, which requires the initial position of the clause to be filled with Topic. Of interest to word order is another property displayed by some WH- complex clauses which require Verb-First. A careful analysis of the structure of these clauses reveals that this is an instantiation of V-to-C movement, also known as the verb second phenomenon (V2). While the movement to the initial position in the main clause is argued to be motivated by Topic, I show that V2 is motivated by the feature Focus which needs to be checked in C. Due to the fact that this operation is sensitive to the phonological property of the complementiser, I make the claim that discourse features, at least in Berber, should be generated at PF. Despite the fact that the subject, object and dative clitics are often grouped under the &#8216;clitic &#8211; banner,&#8217; I show that the first set displays the properties of agreement markers on the verb while the other two sets are claimed to be argument XPs. The approach takes an in-depth theoretical approach to the study of clitics. In a framework where syntax operates on purely formal features, and taking on board the view that clitics as arguments have the formal features required by the computation identical to the ones found with lexical NPs, it is argued that any other distinction between the two sets of arguments is made post-syntactically. Argument structure is then claimed to follow from a fairly small number of principles which govern their syntactic system. The study discusses the movement of clitics at length, and argues it to be phonological. Crucial to the analysis is the fact that this movement operation is not only dependent on the phonological property of clitics but is also dependent on the property of functional elements that host them. Evidence is provided which shows that only functional categories that are phonologically dependent can be hosts. I then conclude that cliticisation is in fact an attraction by the host, a process which occurs during the mapping of the syntactic output to phonology. I further argue that this type of PF merger which is claimed to generate the placement of clitics is constrained by an adjacency relation. Additional support to the claim that morphology should be subject to syntactic principles is found with valency. I show that the system, in many respects, treats the structure of verbs and clauses along the same line. Furthermore, the meaning which is traditionally claimed to be inherent to words is shown from the verbal system to follow from the syntactic structure the verbs project.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">Tharifith Berber, Construct State, Clitics, Distributed Morphology, Valency, Word order.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209974</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unheard voices: A study of parent participation in statutory child protection policy processes in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Mary Bird</field><field name="description">Abstract Service user involvement in service and policy development is vital in order to provide services that meet their needs. In the sensitive and challenging area of statutory child protection, where service users are often marginalized and disempowered, such involvement is likely to be contested and complex. It is, nonetheless, of great importance in order to provide effective responses to the protective needs of children and to the needs of their families, in order to ensure child safety. This qualitative study explores the participation of parents in statutory child protection policy processes in the state of Queensland, Australia. The aims of the study were to understand the Queensland statutory child protection policy context, and to explore the issue of parent participation in policy processes from a number of different perspectives. An analysis of a range of Department of Child Safety (DChS) policy related documents, from the period 1999 &#8211; 2007, was undertaken. Focus group interviews were undertaken with statutory child protection practitioners and policy officers, and with non government child and family welfare practitioners. Individual semi structured interviews were undertaken with a number of parents who are statutory child protection service users. What has emerged is a picture of a service system where parents are likely to be excluded at all levels of decision making. The study found that following inquiries into the failure of the service system, in particular the Crime and Misconduct Commission Inquiry (CMC), DChS has emerged as an individualistic child focused service system with a focus on forensic investigation, risk assessment and management, and with a corresponding loss of focus on family support. The findings indicate that how DChS has redefined its approach to child protection impacts significantly on how parents are engaged by the service system. They highlight inequities in the way service user participation rights have been incorporated into policy and enacted in practice, and the lack of recognition afforded parents as service users and stakeholders in the service system. The findings also suggest that DChS policy processes are focused more on progressing reform agendas and efficient service delivery than they are on service user involvement. Negative portrayals and perceptions of parents, and a perceived lack of understanding of the nexus between disadvantage and child welfare, were also found to contribute to their exclusion. The parent interviews provided valuable insights into their experiences of the service system, indicating the sorts of issues they are likely to bring to the policy table. However, the findings illustrate that they lack the necessary information, support and encouragement to participate, and their experiences of the service system have left them mistrustful of engaging in policy processes, should the opportunity arise. Overall, the findings show that while there is likely to be a number of benefits to parent participation in policy processes, and parents themselves have an interest in participating, there are many barriers to this. While a few potential strategies to engage parents in policy processes were identified, these were often also perceived to have limitations. It is considered that a comprehensive socio-structural approach would be needed in order to reposition parents as participators in policy and service development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statutory child protection, policy, parents, service users,</field><field name="subject">participation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211167</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WHAT FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES SUFFICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MANIFEST WORLD? POWERFUL STRUCTURE</field><field name="creator">Sharon Ford</field><field name="description">This Thesis engages with contemporary philosophical controversies about the nature of dispositional properties or powers and the relationship they have to their non-dispositional counterparts. The focus concerns fundamentality. In particular, I seek to answer the question, &#8216;What fundamental properties suffice to account for the manifest world?&#8217; The answer I defend is that fundamental categorical properties need not be invoked in order to derive a viable explanation for the manifest world. My stance is a field-theoretic view which describes the world as a single system comprised of pure power, and involves the further contention that &#8216;pure power&#8217; should not be interpreted as &#8216;purely dispositional&#8217;, if dispositionality means potentiality, possibility or otherwise unmanifested power or ability bestowed upon some bearer. The theoretical positions examined include David Armstrong&#8217;s Categoricalism, Sydney Shoemaker&#8217;s Causal Theory of Properties, Brian Ellis&#8217;s New Essentialism, Ullin Place&#8217;s Conceptualism, Charles Martin&#8217;s and John Heil&#8217;s Identity Theory of Properties and Rom Harr&#233;&#8217;s Theory of Causal Powers. The central concern of this Thesis is to examine reasons for holding a pure-power theory, and to defend such a stance. This involves two tasks. The first requires explaining what plays the substance role in a pure-power world. This Thesis argues that fundamental power, although not categorical, can be considered ontologically-robust and thus able to fulfil the substance role. A second task&#8212;answering the challenge put forward by Richard Swinburne and thereafter replicated in various neo-Swinburne arguments&#8212;concerns how the manifestly qualitative world can be explained starting from a pure-power base. The Light-like Network Account is put forward in an attempt to show how the manifest world can be derived from fundamental pure power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">dispositional properties</field><field name="subject">categorical properties</field><field name="subject">Foundation-Monism</field><field name="subject">light-like network</field><field name="subject">categoricalism</field><field name="subject">causal theory of properties</field><field name="subject">new essentialism</field><field name="subject">conceptualism</field><field name="subject">identity theory of properties</field><field name="subject">Harr&#233;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A randomised trial of novel upper limb rehabilitation in children with congenital hemiplegia.</field><field name="creator">Leanne Sakzewski</field><field name="description">Abstract Background Congenital hemiplegia is the most common form of cerebral palsy accounting for 1 in 1300 live births. Children usually present with greater upper limb than lower limb involvement. Impaired unimanual capacity of the involved upper limb and deficits in bimanual performance contribute to difficulties with day to day activities and participation in home, school and community life. Interventions to address these deficits in upper limb unimanual capacity and bimanual performance have recently shifted focus to address limitations in activity performance rather than underlying impairments. One intensive intervention approach is constraint induced movement therapy, which entails placing a constraint on the unimpaired upper limb to focus intense and repetitive training of the impaired upper limb. To date, it is unclear whether constraint induced movement therapy is superior to a more traditional bimanual therapy to improve activity performance and participation outcomes for children with congenital hemiplegia, as there has been no direct comparison of the two approaches. Aim The primary aim of this research was to determine whether constraint induced movement therapy was more effective than bimanual training to improve activity performance and participation for children with congenital hemiplegia. The specific aims were to: i) determine the efficacy of therapeutic upper limb interventions on activity and participation outcomes for children with congenital hemiplegia, ii) systematically review the clinimetric properties (psychometric properties and clinical utility) of participation assessment tools for children with congenital hemiplegia, iii) examine the relationship between impairments, unimanual capacity and bimanual performance in children with congenital hemiplegia and, iv) determine whether constraint induced movement therapy is more effective than bimanual training to improve activity and participation outcomes for children with congenital hemiplegia. Research Design A matched pairs randomised design was chosen with children matched for age, gender, side of hemiplegia and upper limb function. Children were randomised within pairs to receive either constraint induced movement therapy or bimanual training in equal dosages. Both interventions used a day camp model, with groups receiving the same dosage and content of intervention delivered in the same environment. A novel circus theme was used in the camps to enhance children&#8217;s engagement and motivation. Children in the constraint induced movement therapy group wore a tailor made glove on their unimpaired hand during the intervention camp. Outcomes were measured across all domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health at baseline, 3 and 26 weeks post intervention. The primary outcome measure for unimanual capacity of the impaired upper limb was the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function, and bimanual performance was the Assisting Hand Assessment. A secondary outcome measure for unimanual capacity was the Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure was used as the primary outcome for participation and three measures, the Assessment of Life Habits, Children&#8217;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment and the School Function Assessment were included to explore their research utility and responsiveness to change. Results Two systematic reviews were performed prior to the commencement of the randomised trial. The first systematic review and meta-analysis of all upper limb interventions for children with congenital hemiplegia identified four treatment approaches with varying evidence to support their efficacy. Interventions included the use of intramuscular Botulinum toxin A injections to the upper limb augmenting upper limb training, neurodevelopmental treatment, constraint induced movement therapy and hand arm intensive bimanual training. Data were pooled for upper limb, self care and individualised outcomes. Results indicated a small to medium treatment effect favouring all four interventions on upper limb outcomes. Large treatment effects favoured intramuscular Botulinum toxin A injections combined with upper limb training for individualised outcomes. Overall, the systematic review and meta-analysis found no upper limb training approach to be superior although Botulinum toxin A injections appeared to provide a consistent supplementary benefit to a variety of upper limb training approaches. However it was unclear which type of upper limb training was optimal. Findings suggested that the two intensive intervention approaches that are the focus of this randomised controlled trial, constraint induced movement therapy and bimanual intensive training, required further research to support their efficacy. The second systematic review was performed to inform choice of participation measures for the randomised comparison trial. The review identified five specific measures of participation suitable for school aged children with congenital hemiplegia (Assessment of Life Habits, Children&#8217;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment, School Function Assessment (participation domain), Children Helping Out: Responsibilities and Expectations, School Outcome Measure) and two measures of individualised outcomes that could include specific participation goals (Goal Attainment Scaling and Canadian Occupational Performance Measure). Results suggested that no one measure adequately captured all aspects of participation as outlined in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, and a combination of assessments would be required to broadly assess children&#8217;s participation in home, school and community life. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure was selected as the primary outcome measure in the randomised trial as it had strong evidence for validity and reliability, had been used in paediatric clinical trials and was responsive to change. Three measures of participation, the Assessment of Life Habits which was completed by the parent/caregiver, the Children&#8217;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment which was completed by the child, and the School Function Assessment, which was completed by the child&#8217;s teacher, were selected to explore the research utility of the measures and their responsiveness to change. Analysis of cross-sectional data collected during screening and baseline assessments for the randomised trial found a strong relationship between bimanual performance and unimanual capacity. Scores on the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function and stereognosis accounted for a significant amount of variance in scores on the Assisting Hand Assessment. There were only moderate associations between impairments (eg. sensory deficits and reduced grip strength) and bimanual performance and unimanual capacity. Age, gender, grip strength and two-point discrimination did not significantly influence bimanual performance. Results of the randomised controlled trial found no differences between groups on any baseline measure. A significant difference between groups favouring the constraint induced movement therapy group was found at 26 weeks on the Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function. There were no differences between groups on any other measure at either immediately post intervention at 3 weeks or in the medium term at 26 weeks. The constraint induced movement therapy group made significant gains in unimanual capacity (Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function and Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function) from baseline to 3 and 26 weeks. The bimanual group demonstrated significant improvement in movement efficiency (Jebsen Taylor Test of Hand Function) by 26 weeks. Significant gains in bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment) were evidenced for both groups from baseline to 3 weeks. These gains were maintained at 26 weeks by the bimanual group only. There were no differences between groups on any participation measures. Both constraint induced movement therapy and bimanual training groups made statistically and clinically significant changes in perceived performance and satisfaction of identified functional goals from baseline to 3 and 26 weeks. Significant gains were made by both groups in personal care on the Assessment of Life Habits from baseline to 26 weeks. There were no changes for either group on the School Function Assessment and Children&#8217;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment. Conclusions This study found minimal differences between the two training approaches. Outcomes achieved by children reflected the mode of upper limb training, that is, improved and sustained gains in unimanual capacity were achieved with a unimanual approach (constraint induced movement therapy), and significant change in bimanual performance was achieved following bimanual training. The constraint induced movement therapy group made initial improvements in bimanual performance that were not sustained at 26 weeks, suggesting that intensive unimanual training may need to be followed by bimanual training in order to retain effects. Both interventions resulted in significant improvements in the achievement of individualised outcomes. Small gains in participation appeared to correspond with specific goal areas identified by children and their caregivers and highlighted the importance of goal directed training and measuring individualised outcomes. Regardless of the type of approach, intervention needs to be goal-directed, focusing on areas of central importance for children and their families.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">congenital hemiplegia</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">upper limb</field><field name="subject">constraint induced movement therapy</field><field name="subject">bimanual training</field><field name="subject">randomised comparison trial</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211322</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of residential property price premia in a metropolis: Reconstitution or contamination?</field><field name="creator">Huston, Simon</field><field name="description">Residential property price premia (&#8216;premia&#8217;) have long fascinated investors, particularly in times of euphoria, but their social, climatic and urban ramifications are much wider. A proper understanding of premia is hindered by the variety of exogenous influences determining them. They occur within idiosyncratic, complex, and continuously reconfiguring metropoli, conditioned by topography, history, regime, commerce, and culture. Given imperfectly competitive housing markets, conventional explanations for premia are either restricted to their financial dissection, trawl though metrics or cast around for hedonic coefficients. However, premia illuminate affordability and other problems in the broader planning and social debate. With the general significance of premia clarified, the research question of the project becomes: &#8216;What drives residential property price premium evolution in a metropolis?&#8217; A complete answer involves dissecting the nature and establishing the location of putative premia and disentangling the influence and interactions of their various price drivers. To provide it, the project conducts a property and urban literature review. Based on theory&#8217;s insight that higher order contains lower order systems, it develops and investigates a general systems model of residential premia with two modes. The system is conditioned by ideology but forced by population and capital inflows. Within it, premia mutate, influenced by a nested hierarchy of more or less contaminated information. To investigate the model and its different modes, the project employs tests across system pointers, at the macro, meso (all urban) and micro spatial resolutions. First, the turbulence and permeability of residential property markets to exogenous influences is assessed. The project then looks at the urban mosaic in the growing Sunbelt migration city of Brisbane, Australia, over the boom period from 1998-2004. Locally, it conducts a case study and survey in one micro-location, seeking clues in transaction patterns (output), property system agents (components) and the information they use (feedback mechanisms). Finally, the project draws some relevant policy implications. Its key findings are that urban housing markets are open, complex and polarised. In an exuberant economic climate, migration and debt fuel metropolitan price escalation. Public urban initiatives reinforce central incumbent affluence or spark fresh bouts of speculation. Individual premia are heterogeneous but often feed off local construction projects or iconic refurbishment. Reflecting their demographics and motives, agent risk appetites are diverse although investors are usually less averse to renewal. System feedback involves a congruence of media and local activity signals. Neither local conviviality nor Bohemian influences are, by themselves, significant. Rather, buyer rationality is validated by post-purchase infrastructure completions. The thesis of this project is, hence, that in euphoric capital markets, migration and debt accelerates the endogenous mutation of property from homes within a community towards speculative paper assets. The implication is that the excessive proliferation of premia indicates economic imbalance and urban malaise which requires recognition and treatment. While premia are paid for perceived privilege or prospects, cognitive risk representations and expectations evolve. Sometimes judgment is contaminated by media fantasy but often validated by accommodating government policy and central revitalisation projects. Yet, within a wider social and ecological remit, rampant premia suggest flaws in urban strategy, governance and planning practice. In terms of windfall events or unearned rent, the cumulative effects of ill-considered projects and price distortions can be ugly and wasteful. They alienate and accentuate spatial privilege without generating sustainable jobs. The project has procedural and substantive policy implications. The dynamics of residential premia cannot be disentangled from capital market volatility, urban fragmentation and reconstitution. Enlightened property development requires visionary urban planning beyond electoral cycles. Rather than unregulated markets or disjointed incrementalism, the project points to the advantages of cohesive projects and inclusive hubs. It impels ecological and people-focused development to nurture capable, connected and considerate edge communities. Its first steps are theoretical recognition, policy clarification, government reform, market constraints, price and tax rationalisation and spatial transparency.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Premia</field><field name="subject">Residentail house prices</field><field name="subject">Metropolis</field><field name="subject">Information asymmetry</field><field name="subject">Systems theory</field><field name="subject">Urban planning</field><field name="subject">Governance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211491</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floral induction and initiation in Ptilotus nobilis: The effect of light intensity, temperature and daylength on floral evocation and development.</field><field name="creator">Sybille Orzek</field><field name="description">Ptilotus nobilis is a short-lived perennial wildflower, native to semi-arid and arid areas of Australia. Propagation by vegetative means is constrained by the early onset and a continuous flowering habit. Despite being defined as the main barrier for vegetative propagation no published research on floral induction and initiation was found. The aim of this study is to provide the first insights into floral evocation in P. nobilis, with the general objectives being to investigate floral induction and initiation, find the means to maintain plants in the vegetative phase, enhance leaf initiation and to gain knowledge of growth and development with an emphasis on light intensity, temperature and daylength. Early experiments aimed to increase the understanding of growth and development. The main cardinal events were identified including the onset of branching (axillary stem growth), visible bud stage, first floret opening and maturity of the inflorescence. To aid future cultivation schedules, four growing degree days (GDD) and one chronological model, using days after sowing (DAS), were established and validated. All GDD models were accurate in predicting first floret opening and maturity, but not in predicting visible bud stage. Best prediction was achieved by using an upper temperature threshold of 18.2 &#186;C and an own base temperature of 5.0 &#186;C. Days after sowing were an accurate means of prediction, indicating that temperature and other variables such as light intensity regulate development. A series of defoliation treatments investigated the maintenance of P. nobilis plants in the vegetative phase. Within all treatments, reproductive structures were observed and all plants with more than two true leaves entered the reproductive phase. Plants with less than two true leaves showed a delayed floral bud appearance by up to 20 days. Floral development was affected by most defoliation treatments resulting in vegetative growth within the inflorescences. It is hypothesized that plants have a very short juvenile phase and that a constant floral stimulus may be needed for floral evocation. Using scanning electron and light microscopy a template for the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase was developed. Bract initiation was accompanied by a significant increase in meristem area and diameter, and was defined as the onset of flowering. The established template was used in a subsequent glasshouse trial, which revealed that floral initiation occurred very early and at 25 DAS all plants had entered the reproductive phase. Branching and leaf area expansion were identified as post- initiation processes. Plants were exposed to different light intensities (229.3, 398.6 and 909.3 &#181;mol m-2 s-1) in a glasshouse. Under low light, final leaf number increased by up to three leaves, indicating that the vegetative phase was prolonged. Cardinal events were delayed but all plants reached maturity. It was concluded that a light intensity of 229.3 &#181;mol m-2 s-1 was not low enough to prevent floral initiation and that a further decrease of light intensity in combination with temperature could be more effective. Interactions of light intensity, temperature and daylength were investigated. Plants were grown under high light and low light (&lt; 1.2 MJ m-2) intensities, 25/10 &#186;C and 35/20 &#186;C and daylengths of 11 h and 16 h. During the trial period (42 days), low light intensity suppressed floral initiation and high temperatures maintained more plants (70%) in the vegetative phase. However daylength treatments had no effect on the time of bract initiation or the percentage of vegetative plants. After 83 days floral buds and axillary stems were observed on some plants under low light intensity, indicating the onset of the reproductive phase and showing that P. nobilis could not be maintained in the vegetative phase indefinitely. Plants under high light were harvested at maturity and effects of temperature and daylength were analysed. Final leaf number increased under 35/20 &#186;C supporting the previously established results that floral initiation was delayed and leaf production enhanced by high temperature. Morphological data was collected to classify the photoperiodic response of P. nobilis. Plants under 25/10 &#186;C and 11 h had the longest inflorescences and greatest number of buds and flowers, which was also reflected in the buds and flowers dry weight, with an increase of up to 3.4 fold under these conditions. The difficulty of classifying some plants accordingly to their photoperiodic response and the proposal that P. nobilis may be a facultative short day plant under 25/10 &#186;C is discussed. In summary, this study presents the first evidence that P. nobilis has a very short juvenile phase and that growth and development are mainly driven by light intensity and temperature. It was possible to enhance vegetative growth by defoliation, low light intensity and high temperatures, however this did not fully prevent flowering, which indicates that P. nobilis has a very strong flowering response or signal.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">Ptilotus nobilis</field><field name="subject">Floral Induction</field><field name="subject">Floral initiation</field><field name="subject">floral evocation</field><field name="subject">light intensity</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">daylength</field><field name="subject">photoperiod</field><field name="subject">defoliation</field><field name="subject">growing degree days</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211556</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detecting changes in coral reef environments in response to subtle disturbances: from organism to holobiont community responses</field><field name="creator">Juan Ortiz</field><field name="description">Coral reef environments have been degrading steadily over the last few decades. It is generally accepted now that coral reefs are one of the first marine ecosystems to show measurable perturbations driven by global warming. Some of theses perturbations are consequence of extreme stochastic disturbances like hurricanes or extreme thermal anomalies and therefore, can be easily identified using broad indicators like coral cover. These indicators are easy to measure and provide a general description of the system in question. The detection and interpretation of more subtle perturbation in coral communities is more complicated, both logistically and conceptually. However, detecting chronic perturbations at an early stage can increase significantly the success of early mitigating management strategies. This thesis focuses on the development and application of highly sensitive indicators that can detect subtle perturbations in coral communities. It also studies the ecological interpretation of mild perturbations and their effect on the future structure of coral reef environments. The mild thermal disturbance experienced by the Heron Island reef in the south of the Great Barrier Reef during the 2005-2006 summer, and an environmental gradient along the central coast of Venezuela (south Caribbean Sea), were used as models to test the sensitivity of coral reefs to mild disturbances at different organisation levels (organism, population, and community). At the organismal level my results showed that the intensity of bleaching that a colony shows during a mild thermal disturbance is affected by the morphology of the colony as well as the substrates surrounding the colony. Colonies surrounded by sand bleached more than colonies surrounded by dead coral or rubble. I propose that reef specific information on the relative cover of sand, rubble, and dead coral can improve the fine scale accuracy of bleaching predicting models. Studying the same mild thermal disturbance at Heron Island, I showed how demographic parameters of some populations are more sensitive to mild thermal disturbances than coral cover (the most widely used response variable in coral monitoring programs around the world). Furthermore, my results suggest that the response of coral populations to mild thermal disturbance is different in nature and intensity to the respond observed during extreme thermal disturbances. Some taxa like Stylophora pistillata, are highly sensitive to extreme thermal disturbances, and tend to be the first to die under these conditions. In contrast, this taxon was extremely tolerant to the mild thermal disturbance of early 2006 in comparison to other taxa identified previously as more tolerant than S. pistillata. This difference in the response of coral environments to milder more common disturbances can have great influence in the trajectory that coral reefs follow in a rapidly changing world. Finally at a community level, I demonstrated how the power to detect the effect of environmental conditions on coral environments is drastically increased when the coral host-endosymbiotic algae relationship is interpreted holistically. The percentage of the variability of the community structure that can be explained by environmental variables in the central coast of Venezuela is doubled when the unit of selection considered is the holobiont instead of the coral host or the endosymbiont independently. This approach can be crucial for the detection of subtle changes in coral communities as the frequency and intensity of disturbances increase rapidly. The increase in detection power provided by the different approaches developed in this project can both improve our understanding of the structuring role of mild disturbances in coral communities as well as help identify the effect of disturbances in an early stage before the perturbation reaches catastrophic proportions. This early identification of perturbations can be used for the development of adaptive management strategies that can increase the resistance and resilience of coral reefs in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coral reefs</field><field name="subject">Disturbances</field><field name="subject">Perturbations</field><field name="subject">Bleaching</field><field name="subject">Holobiont</field><field name="subject">Demographic</field><field name="subject">Coral-Symbiodinium</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211612</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A mathematical model of a continuous sugar centrifuge</field><field name="creator">Swindells, R.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dr Alfred Jefferis Turner, 1861-1947 : his contribution to medicine in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thearle, M.

The evaluation is performed through comparison between the experiment and finite element analysis of indentation of soft tissue phantom and human brain phantom. The evaluation is done in terms of the forces acting on the cylindrical Aluminium indenter and deformation of the phantoms due to these forces. The deformation of the phantoms is measured by tracking 3D motions of X-ray opaque markers implanted in the direct neighbourhood under the indenter using a custom-made biplane X-ray image intensifiers (XRII) system. The phantoms are made of Sylgard&#174; 527 gel to simulate the hyperelastic constitutive behaviour of the brain tissue. The phantoms are prepared layer by layer to facilitate the implantation of the X-ray opaque markers. The modelling of soft tissue phantom indentation and human brain phantom indentation is performed using the ABAQUSTM/Standard finite element solver. Realistic geometry model of the human brain phantom obtained from Magnetic Resonance images is used. Specific constitutive properties of the phantom layers determined through uniaxial compression tests are used in the model. The models accurately predict the indentation force-displacement relations and marker displacements in both soft tissue phantom indentation and human brain phantom indentation. Good agreement between the experimental and modelling results verifies the reliability and accuracy of the finite element analysis techniques used in this study and confirms the predictive power of these techniques in application to surgical simulation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain -- Surgery -- Simulation methods -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Brain -- Surgery -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Soft tissue injuries -- Surgery -- Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Soft tissue injuries -- Surgery -- Simulation methods -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Finte element method</field><field name="subject">Finite element analysis</field><field name="subject">Surgical simulation</field><field name="subject">Bi-plane X-ray image intensifers system</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0089</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Joseph John Talbot Hobbs (1864-1938) : and his Australian-English architecture</field><field name="creator">Taylor, John J.</field><field name="description">Architect and soldier Sir J.J. Talbot Hobbs was born on 24 August 1864 in London. After migrating from England to Western Australia in the late 1880s, Hobbs designed many buildings that were constructed in Perth, Fremantle, and regional areas of the State. Although Talbot Hobbs has previously been recognised as a significant and influential contributor to architecture in Australia, his development as an architect has not been documented, nor has his design output undergone critical analysis. A number of problems confront attempts to interpret Hobbs' contribution to architecture. One is that a number of his most prominent building designs have been demolished. Another is that national recognition for his achievements as a First World War Army General have overshadowed his extraordinarily productive pre and post-war career as an architect. Military service was intrinsic to his character, and thus is woven in to this architectural biography. The thesis examines Hobbs' life and work, filling the gap in documented evidence of his contributions, and fitting it within the context of Australian architectural and social history. The main proposition to be tested is whether Hobbs' Australian architecture, of English derivation, combined with vast community service, warrants his recognition as an architect and citizen of national significance. Completely new important issues, information, discussion and facts that have resulted from the research for this thesis are: 1. Biographical knowledge about Hobbs' life &#150; including his upbringing, education and training in England, and his fifty years of comprehensive work and community service in and for Australia; 2. The elucidation of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century architectural issues that were relevant to Hobbs and other architects in Western Australia; 3. Examination of the important works of Hobbs' architect predecessors and contemporaries in Perth, and the setting of his own work within this context; 4. Revelation of his primary and pivotal role in war memorial design and organisational work for the far-flung theatres of Australian Army conflicts and selected personal design works within Australia itself during 1919-38; and 5. A chronology and summary of Hobbs' life, with thorough documentation of his output as a sole practitioner in the period 1887-1904 by development of a detailed web-based database - an extremely valuable tool for future researchers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hobbs, Joseph John Talbot, -- 1864-1938</field><field name="subject">Architecture -- Western Australia -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Architecture -- Western Australia -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Architects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Architects and community -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">War memorials -- Western Australia -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">World War, 1914-1918 -- Western Australia -- Monuments</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">War memorials</field><field name="subject">Talbot Hobbs</field><field name="subject">St George's Terrace</field><field name="subject">World War One</field><field name="subject">Hobbs, Smith and Forbes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0100</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal and spatial effects of a long term large scale alley farming experiment on water table dynamics : implications for effective agroforestry design</field><field name="creator">Noorduijn, Saskia L.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Removal of native vegetation to facilitate traditional agriculture practices has been shown to reduce ecosystem health, and restricts the native habitat. The subsequent change in the predominant vegetation water use patterns has altered the catchment water balance, and hydrology which results in land degradation through such processes of salinisation and water logging. More recently, moves toward more sustainable farming practices have been taken to help re-establish catchment hydrological equilibrium and improve catchment ecosystem services. Agroforestry is one such vehicle for this reestablishment. Perennial native vegetation has been shown to have a significant effect on catchment processes, mitigating any further degradation of the land. The effect of alternating native perennial tree belts with traditional broad acre agriculture in the alleys, referred to as alley farming, is investigated in this thesis due to the potential environmental and economic benefits that can result. This thesis investigates the impact of tree belts upon the water table and aims to gauge the ability of alley farming at controlling recharge within the low-medium rainfall zone on the valley floor. The basis of this research is the analysis of data collected from the Toolibin Alley Faring Trial. This experiment was established in 1995 to assess the viability of alley farming and incorporates different combinations of belt width, alley width and revegetation density. Transects of piezometers within each design have been monitored from October 1995 to January 2008. The piezometers were sporadically monitored over this period on a total of 39 dates. ...  To further understand the response observed in the water table data, in depth hydrograph analysis of the control piezometer water levels was conducted. The statistical analysis demonstrates that the belts are having a very limited impact on the water table morphology, this is associated with the restricted use of groundwater by the perennial tree belts due to the poor quality, has been applied. This explains why there is limited signature of increased water table depth in the statistical analysis; there is evidence that alley farming as a means of reducing recharge may work however the overriding control on the trial are the rainfall trends rather than perennial growth. The low perennial biomass production at the site is an effect of limited water resources; however a significant distinction can be made between the water table depth and variability beneath high and low biomass belts. There are three main controls at the site; climate, development of perennial biomass and development of perennial root systems (both vertically and laterally). The regional climatic trends will influence water table levels creating a greater soil water storage capacity; therefore the contribution of soil water to transpiration rates will enable the tree belts to have some impact on recharge. Of the alley farming designs tested, the optimal planting density and belt/alley design, from an economic perspective, is identified as having a 4m belt width which generated the greatest biomass. As a means of controlling recharge at the site the effectiveness of alley farming is limited due the shallow saline water table limiting perennial growth.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tree belts</field><field name="subject">Spatial statistics</field><field name="subject">Water table dynamics</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus vegrandis</field><field name="subject">Agroforestry -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Water table -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Spatial analysis -- Statistics</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Hedgerow intercropping -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Tree crops -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0102</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

This thesis seeks to understand the significance of women&#8217;s participation in modern Chinese art history through the narratives and works of Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen, who were professionally active at different political stages of twentieth-century China. Using an interdisciplinary framework, drawing on concepts from theories such as modernism, feminism and postcolonialism, this thesis analyzes a culturally specific field in art history and the interrelationship between various factors that have contributed to it. As artists of a peripheral culture, various factors in the artistic production of Chinese women have been overlooked and often misinterpreted. This thesis argues that the three artists in this study have produced different, individualized responses to the Euro-American model of modernism. To highlight the cultural specificity of China, the introductory chapter will include a short comparative analysis between Chinese modernism and the modernisms of other Asian countries. The adoption of Western art forms by early overseas-trained Chinese artists such as Pan indicates as many intricacies and ambivalences as in the complex relationship of China with Western imperialism. Chapter Two situates the Westernized works of Pan in the context of Chinese modernism, pre-feminism and the semi-colonized state of early twentieth-century China. In relation to the theories of orientalism and provincialism, implications of the ambiguities of Pan&#8217;s representations are extended to debates that explore the subjectivity and identity of non-European artists in their quest for modernism. Nie Ou was born into the era when the Chinese Communists had just taken over in 1949. Under the autocratic rule of the Communists, Nie was exiled to the northern countryside during her early adulthood as part of the &#8220;re-educating the elite&#8221; program. Chapter Three demonstrates how Nie successfully emerged from the repercussions of the Cultural Revolution. During this period of intensified Chinese nationalism, Nie found ways to merge the influences of the restrictive style of Socialist Realism and the poetic Chinese literati painting tradition to create an individualized style of representation. China underwent rapid modernization in the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter Four examines the works of contemporary artist Yin Xiuzhen who, with her avant-garde installations, has pushed the boundaries of what constitutes conventional Chinese art. This chapter analyzes Yin&#8217;s works in the context of late twentieth-century China, where the nation was no longer a Socialist monolith but a complex amalgam in which old and new, Socialist and capitalist, modern and postmodern co-existed. Yin&#8217;s works will be studied in relation to theories of postmodernism, postfeminism and globalism. Chapter Five consolidates the earlier chapters by reflecting on how various conditions throughout the twentieth century have changed and shaped the role of women in Chinese art history. The concluding chapter will consider the influence Chinese women artists may have on the art discourse in China today, and perhaps across other cultures. This chapter will explore the constraints upon them and the potential of their future role, not only in China but also in the broader sense of what it means to be an artist internationally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Chinese culture, Chinese women artists, feminism, postcolonialism, modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Historical ecology of coral communities from the inshore Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">George Roff</field><field name="description">Trajectories of decline have been described in coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region, with long-term losses of abundance, diversity and habitat structure. Since European settlement of the Queensland coastline in the mid-18th century, widespread changes in land use have occurred within Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments (e.g. extensive land clearing, agriculture and grazing). Despite direct and indirect evidence indicating decline of inshore reefs, it has proven difficult to ascertain links between land use changes, terrestrial discharge, water quality and the decline of coral reefs at regional scales, and the contributions of anthropogenic influences to the disturbance regimes of inshore reefs remains highly controversial. This thesis uses palaeoecological reconstruction of coral assemblages and high-precision U-Series dating to examine changes in community structure of inshore coral reefs in the Palm Islands region across decadal and centennial scales. Comparisons of modern and historical coral assemblages provide evidence of a collapse of Acropora coral communities at Pelorus Reef in the early 20th Century. Fossil assemblages in an adjacent site at Pelorus provide further evidence of an extrinsic shift from historical Acropora assemblages to more sediment-tolerant corals in modern assemblages, a change without precedence in 800 years of record. Sediment cores (2-5m length) were extracted from Pandora and Havannah reefs to determine long-term rates of reef growth throughout the late Holocene. Computer Axial Tomography (CAT) scans of cores revealed a framework dominated by coral fragments, and U-Series dating of corals revealed rapid and continuous reef growth at both reefs throughout the last 1000 yrs. Comparisons of reef accretion (m ka-1) from cores with published accretion rates from early-mid Holocene inshore GBR reefs show that reef slope environments are now accreting at rates equal to and exceeding those of the last 8000 years. This result contradicts assumptions that inshore reefs are undergoing or have undergone natural trajectories of geomorphic decline. A bayesian approach to determine stability of coral communities from the Pandora and Havannah cores indicates that those coral communities have existed in stable states for upwards of 400yrs, punctuated by periods of instability. Contrary to some paradigms of biodiversity, the high diversity communities were unstable on centennial scales, 4 yet the low diversity assemblages did not necessarily confer stability to these assemblages. Growth rates of inshore reefs were independent of diversity or community structure. From a management perspective, these results provide a longer-term (decades to centuries) understanding of coral community dynamics on inshore reefs of the GBR that provides a basis for detecting and understanding changes following European settlement, and a baseline for the management and potential restoration of coral communities at local and regional scales.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coral</field><field name="subject">Reef</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Palaeoecology</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">U-Series</field><field name="subject">Radiometric</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211493</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making Their Way-Making Art and Making Money: The working lives of visual artists with disabilities</field><field name="creator">Susan Maley</field><field name="description">Abstract of Making Their Way&#8212;Making Art and Making Money: The working lives of visual artists with disabilities Susan Agatha Maley People with disabilities have marked lower rates of employment than people without disabilities in both Australia and the United States, the countries chosen for this research inquiry. That this is the case decades after the introduction of anti-discrimination laws in these developed democratic countries highlights the continuum of constraints people with disabilities still experience in securing work. Some of these constraints include socially discriminatory attitudes and perceptions, the lack of available accommodations and adaptations in work settings (and the misconception that they will be onerous and expensive to implement), lack of accessible transportation, the unavailability of work within established job markets and the restrictions of vocational rehabilitation and disability employment programs&#8217; past focus on existing jobs in organisational settings. These constraints have a negative impact on the overall quality of life for many people with disabilities as employment is a key component to individual self-sufficiency and personal fulfilment and also crucial to inclusion in community and social settings. Among the notable initiatives to address these persistent inequities are research-informed projects focusing on self-employment as a viable alternative mode of employment to the established job market. Within the last decade, myriad research reports, model demonstration projects, and a US national research program, funded by the Office of Disability Employment Policy, have been demonstrating the success of self-employment in expanding self-determined income generation. Within this burgeoning and productive investigation on self-employment, one gap is that there has been little focused inquiry on creative work. Such a void is significant since the predominant work mode among visual artists is self-employment, albeit sometimes supplemented with other arts, and non-arts related work. This study addresses the lack of investigation of artists&#8217; modes of work by examining the working lives of practicing professional visual artists with a range of significant physical, sensory and neurological disabilities. There are a number of reasons for this research study&#8217;s focus on the area of visual arts. Visual arts has been documented to be one of the largest groups among artistic disciplines in studies in both Australia and the US, as well as European countries. Within this sizable arts arena, there are established and emerging markets for sale of visual arts products. This discipline can also offer flexible work locations, hours and adaptations in art making. Thus, there may be numerous benefits to pursuing careers in the visual arts for creative people with disabilities. Yet, little is known about the lived work experience of practicing visual artists with disabilities and their career strategies. Thus, an exploration of visual artists with disabilities working in a range of mediums such as this research study can reveal new, and potentially useful, knowledge about their methods of art-making and marketing, adaptations in the design and execution of their work, their experiences of disability and the facilitators and obstacles they face when preparing for and pursuing their working lives as artists. This research study is based on the results of in-depth, face-to-face interviews of twenty-one visual artists, eleven in Australia and ten in the US, who used multiple artistic mediums. The conceptual lens for the analysis is intersectionality with an underlying critical realism foundation. These theories were used to explore the intersecting social positions of being a person with a disability and a practicing artist and the related interplay of agency and structure in shaping the careers of these artists. The main findings from this research focus on how the artists in this study made their way, made art and made money. These findings commence with an examination of the early shaping and continued sustaining influences in their artistic development and education. It continues with an exploration of the influence of their disability experiences on making art including their adaptive methods and conceptual process. The analysis continues with a focus on factors involving their means of making money, marketing and self-promotion methods and professional progressions. The findings conclude with an analysis of aids and obstacles these artists with disabilities experienced during interactions with a range of organisations including disability employment and vocational rehabilitation counselling and financial support agencies, arts educational institutions, art galleries and arts and disability agencies. Highlights of the findings are that the majority of the artists in the study earned their income from arts and arts related work, that they made active use of their own personal and collective agency to meet their artistic and professional goals and that their actions influenced structural change. They also positioned aspects of their social and personal identity to best suit their career progressions and some made artistic use of their conceptions of disability with innovative impact on social conceptions of disability. Implications of these findings are that artists experiencing disability developed strategic skills to negotiate difficult terrain while forging an income-producing arts practice. In addition, their creation of new options for themselves, and other artists with disabilities, has wider implications for improving equity for artists with disabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artists with disabilities</field><field name="subject">disability</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">self-employment</field><field name="subject">visual artists</field><field name="subject">intersectionality</field><field name="subject">critical realism</field><field name="subject">agency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211554</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the mechanics of high energy flames applied to the penetration of rocks</field><field name="creator">Just, G.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory

The mixed methods design utilised a medical record review of 60 frail elderly hospital patients, a stratified survey of 3,015 adults in the South Australian community, and interviews with 36 stakeholders ( 10 elderly people, 10 younger relatives, and 18 health professionals ). The medical record review confirmed that the hospital patients and their outcomes resembled those described internationally. It was used to develop a hypothetical vignette, used in the later studies. Survey responses suggested that when considering a hypothetical long - term care decision, community members put the elderly person ' s physical health and safety first. Situational variables ( the elderly person ' s autonomy, environmental adaptation, and caregiver burden ) appeared secondary, albeit less so with increasing age of the respondent. Thematic analysis of the interviews demonstrated that elderly stakeholders considering a hypothetical decision were more likely to mention autonomy values, and less likely to mention safety values, than were relatives or health professionals. However, elderly stakeholders were also more likely to suggest restrictive solutions, such as residential placement and proxy decision - making. This finding raised methodological issues concerning ' third person ' vignettes, in that respondents might be responding as proxy decision - makers, rather than as if the hypothetical decision applied to themselves. The project confirmed that, in this context, prospectively held values resembled the retrospectively described values identified by McCullough, Wilson, Teasdale, Kolpakchi and Shelly ( 1993 ). Hence, the retrospective literature could be applied. The project supported the importance and complexity of psychosocial predisposing factors when applying the Andersen Behavioral Model ( Andersen, 1995 ) to long - term care decisions. Additionally, the Ecological Theory of Aging ( Nahemow, 2000 ) and the MacArthur Model of Successful Aging ( Andrews, Clark, &amp; Luszcz, 2002 ) were found to be relevant to long - term care decisions for individuals and populations. It was concluded that both clinically, and at a policy level, discussions of long - term care could be more effective if they focussed on maintenance of elderly people ' s autonomy and control, rather than on their physical health and safety.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">frail elderly care, older people long term care, aged needs, aged care</field><field name="subject">Nursing home care South Australia</field><field name="subject">Older people Care South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Nursing home care Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical and Computational Techniques for Predicting the Squat of Ships</field><field name="creator">Gourlay, Tim Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the squat of a moving ship; that is, the downward displacement and angle of trim caused by its forward motion. The thesis is divided into two parts, in which the ship is considered to be moving in water of constant depth and non-constant depth respectively. In both parts, results are given for ships in channels and in open water.  Since squat is essentially a Bernoulli effect, viscosity is neglected throughout most of the work, which results in a boundary value problem involving Laplace's equation. Only qualitative statements about the effect of viscosity are made.  For a ship moving in water of constant depth, we first consider a one-dimensional theory for narrow channels. This is described for both linearized flow, where the disturbance due to the ship is small, and nonlinear flow, where the disturbance due to the ship is large. For nonlinear flow we develop an iterative method for determining the nonlinear sinkage and trim. Conditions for the existence of steady flow are determined, which take into account the squat of the ship.  We then turn to the problem of ships moving in open water, where one-dimensional theory is no longer applicable. A well-known slender-body shallow-water theory is modified to remove the singularity which occurs when the ship's speed is equal to the shallow-water wave speed. This is done by including the effect of dispersion, in a manner similar to the derivation of the Korteweg-deVries equation. A finite-depth theory is also used to model the flow near the critical speed.  For a ship moving in water of non-uniform depth, a linearized one-dimensional theory is derived which is applicable to unsteady flow. This is applied to simple bottom topographies, using analytic as well as numerical methods. A corresponding slender-body shallow-water theory for variable depth is also developed, which is valid for ships in channels or open water. Numerical results are given for a step depth change, and an analytic solution to the problem is discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">squat, ship, shallow water</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are the claims for emotional intelligence justified ? Emotional intelligence predicts life skills, but not as well as personality and cognitive abilities</field><field name="creator">Bastian, Veneta Anne</field><field name="description">Emotional Intelligence ( EI ) is held to explain how emotions may function to advance life goals, with the basic proposition being that individuals monitor and discriminate emotions within themselves and others to solve problems. A number of different theories of EI have been proposed and consequently there is still controversy about the best way in which to conceptualise and measure EI. It is, nonetheless, agreed that the relevance of EI is largely dependent on it being able to predict significant life outcomes. Academic achievement, life satisfaction, coping, problem - solving ability and anxiety are variables that have relevance in academic, occupational and interpersonal situations. The relationship between these variables and EI was assessed in two diverse populations ( University sample : N = 246 ; mean age = 19.9 ; Older community sample : N = 212 ; mean age = 51.6 ). The magnitude and direction of findings in both studies were found to be remarkably similar. As expected, older adults ( community sample ) were found to score significantly higher on EI than younger adults ( University sample ). Few gender differences in EI, however, were apparent, but those that were significantly favoured females. Previously identified relationships suggesting that self - report EI measures are moderately - to - highly correlated to personality, whereas ability EI is reasonably distinct from other constructs, were also upheld. Inconsistent with previous research, however, differential associations between EI and verbal and abstract reasoning ability were not observed. Fitting theoretical expectations, in both studies EI was low - to - moderately correlated with higher life satisfaction, problem and emotion focused coping and perceived problem solving ability and with lower avoidance coping and anxiety. However, the correlations for academic achievement were not significant. These correlations were found to be higher for self - report EI than they were ability EI, perhaps due to method variance with the life skills. Nevertheless, despite these low - to - moderate correlations, hierarchical regression analyses controlling for personality and cognitive abilities revealed that the incremental predictive validity of EI was 7 % at most. This finding was found for all life skills regardless of the EI measure involved. This raises some implications for the field of EI and highlights that personality and cognitive abilities should be taken into account when making assertions about EI ' s predictive power.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotional intelligence, cognitive styles</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37831</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inspection time as a biological marker for functional age</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Tess Anne</field><field name="description">Inspection Time (IT) is a speed measure that has been primarily investigated in the field of individual differences. However, Nettelbeck and Wilson (2004) proposed that IT could have promise as a biomarker for functional outcomes, particularly cognitive aging. The premise behind biomarker research is that chronological age is simply a proxy for the physiological and cognitive changes that occur in the body with advancing age. Biomarkers are measures that 'mark' the aging process and represent the biological age of an individual rather than the years since his/her birth. Speed of processing tasks offer promise as biomarkers because decline in speed of processing is one of the most robust findings in cognitive aging research. However, traditionally used tasks are problematic because they confound speed and accuracy and some are sensitive to cohort effects. Inspection time is a speed of processing measure that is free from these problems and is therefore a promising candidate for a biomarker. This dissertation presents the first empirical investigation of this proposition. One hundred and fifty elderly participants were assessed on IT, traditionally used biomarkers (e.g. grip strength, visual acuity), a battery of cognitive tasks (e.g. fluid ability and crystallised ability) and measures of everyday functioning (e.g. activities of daily living). These individuals were assessed on three separate occasions over a period of 18-months. For the biomarkers, initial scores, 6-month change scores and 18-month change scores were generated and used to predict final scores and 18-month change scores on the functional outcomes (cognition and everyday functioning). Results revealed that slow IT at the start of the study was associated with dependence in activities of daily living and poorer fluid ability at the end of the study. There was also evidence that slow IT at the start was associated with decline in fluid reasoning over the subsequent 18-months. Moreover, consistent with the major aims of this study, decline in IT over time was associated with more cognitive problems in daily life and poor fluid ability at the end of the study. Given that initial and change scores for IT were independent, due to the methodology used to estimate them, the two measures explained unique variance in the functional outcome measures.These findings are extremely encouraging, particularly given the relatively short time frame for this study. IT has predictive validity for everyday functioning and cognitive aging over an 18-month period, and therefore, it is concluded that IT has promise as a valid biomarker for functional age. Recommendations for further research include investigating the link between IT and mortality, examining the association between IT and a broader range of functional age measures, the replication of these findings in a different sample, and means for improving the sensitivity and specificity of the current IT estimation procedure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognition in old age</field><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Aging Physiological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37873</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental responsibility for the illicit acts of their children</field><field name="creator">White, Nancy A</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to explore the psychological, political, legal, and parental notions of parental responsibility in Australia. The initial study involved an analysis of Australian print media over a four-year period ( 2001 - 2005 ) and highlighted how the representation of this topic has been weaved into public awareness. Political justifications of such legislation involved positioning parents whose children offend as either ' bad ' parents or parents with poor skills. Once such parents were positioned as problematic then the benefits of the legislation to society, children and the parents was touted. Over the period of the study such representations increased in the Australian print media, with no articles published in 2001 on this topic, and 46 articles relating to parental responsibility by 2005. The first empirical study involved an examination of the effect of the age and gender of the young offender, the type of offence ( property or personal ) and the severity of the offence ( low or high ) on attributions of responsibility to parents and children. Findings suggested that participants ( 93 parents ) view children as mainly responsible when they offend regardless of age ( 10, or 13 years of age ). However, results also indicated that as children mature, their responsibility increases. Parents were attributed significantly less responsibility for their children's offending behaviour, with their responsibility decreasing as their children's age increases. The responsibility of children and their parents also significantly increased as the severity of the offence increased. These findings were replicated in Study 2 ( N = 177 parents ) despite the inclusion of a 16-year-old offender. The older adolescent child was attributed more responsibility than the 10 and 13 year old offender, and the parent was attributed less responsibility for their child's offending. Data from Study 1 and 2 were qualitatively analysed and an analysis of the qualitative components of both studies indicated that parents attributed responsibility to children who were seen to understand issues of right and wrong, or when it was evident that children had planned the behaviour. Parents were attributed responsibility on the basis of their level of surveillance of their children, using supervision and communication to monitor their children appropriately. Inadequate parenting resulted in failure to control and supervise one's children. Parents also employed various justifications to mitigate parents and their children's responsibility, with children's age being used to argue immaturity and therefore diminished culpability. Sixteen-year-old adolescent children were positioned as distinctly different from the two other age groups.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Responsibility</field><field name="subject">Parent and child</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquency</field><field name="subject">Conduct disorders in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Conduct disorders in children</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37898</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early diagnosis and detection of Eutypa dieback of grapevines.</field><field name="creator">Lardner, Richard</field><field name="description">Eutypa dieback of grapevines, caused by Eutypa lata, is a major cause of reduced longevity in vineyards worldwide. The fungus grows in the woody tissue of infected vines, producing translocatable toxins that cause foliar symptoms of the disease. By the time foliar symptoms are evident the pathogen may have become well established in the vine. One aim of this study was to develop DNA markers to allow rapid reliable identification of E. lata and to detect the pathogen in infected wood. The second aim was to analyse secondary metabolite production by E. lata in order to gain information on the compounds responsible for the foliar symptoms of the disease and to identify metabolites which could be used as markers to detect the early stages of the disease prior to the expression of foliar symptoms. In addition, genetic variation of the pathogen was assessed using RFLP and RAPD analysis. Two techniques were used to develop DNA markers; first, SCAR markers derived from RAPD fragments were developed and, second, an E. lata genomic DNA library was constructed, from which DNA fragments specific to E. lata were identified. These markers were used in either PCR- or Southern hybridisation-based assays to detect the pathogen in infected wood. PCR-based detection of the pathogen in infected wood was prone to inhibition by phenolic compounds, however, Southern hybridisation techniques were capable of detecting E. lata in wood. Genetic variation among 38 isolates of E. lata was assessed using six randomly selected clones from the genomic DNA library. A subset of 11 isolates was subjected to RAPD analysis using 10 random primers. Considerable genetic diversity, in terms of RFLP and RAPD profiles, was observed among isolates. There was no apparent correlation between grouping of isolates following neighbour joining analysis and either host species or geographic origin of isolates. The RAPD and RFLP profiles of two isolates differed significantly from the majority of the other isolates. These isolates, which were morphologically similar to all other isolates, were subsequently found not to be E. lata. Secondary metabolite production of 11 isolates was analysed by HPLC following growth on a range of media. A wider range of secondary metabolites was detected in E. lata than has previously been reported. Two of the secondary metabolites, eutypine and an unidentified compound with a retention time of 19.6 min, were produced by eight of nine isolates of E. lata. Neither of the non-E. lata isolates produced these compounds. It was concluded that the remaining isolate of E. lata may have lost the ability to produce these compounds following storage. Whilst a wider range of isolates needs to be screened before a candidate marker can be selected, these results suggest that certain compounds are present in the majority of E. lata isolates and, hence, may prove suitable markers for the detection of the pathogen prior to the expression of foliar symptoms. The molecular probes developed in this study will allow the rapid and reliable identification and detection of E. lata in grapevine cane or wood. These probes also have the potential to be used as a research tool to gather information on the epidemiology of the disease and to assess the efficacy of potential control agents against E. lata. Suitable control measures could then be applied to vines which have been shown by the use of chemical markers to have latent infection. Used in combination, therefore, the DNA and biochemical markers could facilitate improved management of eutypa dieback.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">viticulture, grapes, Eutypa lata</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37969</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Black Aspergillus species: implications for ochratoxin A in Australian grapes and wine.</field><field name="creator">Leong, Su-lin L.</field><field name="description">Ochratoxin A (OA), a nephrotoxin and potential carcinogen, has been found in many foods, including grapes and grape products. Limits of 2 &#956;g/kg in wine and 10 &#956;g/kg in dried vine fruit have been introduced by the European Union. This study presents information on the ecology of ochratoxin A production by black Aspergillus spp. in Australian vineyards, and the passage of the toxin throughout winemaking. Aspergillus niger and A. carbonarius were isolated from vineyard soils in 17 of 17, and four of 17 Australian viticultural regions, respectively. A. aculeatus was isolated infrequently. All thirty-two isolates of A. carbonarius and three of 100 isolates of A. niger produced OA. Of Australian A. niger isolates analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms within the internal transcribed spacer region of 5.8S ribosomal DNA, 61 of 113 isolates, including the three toxigenic isolates, were of type N pattern, and 52 were type T. A selection of these A. carbonarius and A. niger aggregate isolates, as well as imported isolates, were compared using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. ERIC and AFLP clearly differentiated A. niger from A.carbonarius. AFLP further divided A. niger into types N and T. Six polymorphic microsatellite markers, developed specifically for A. niger, also differentiated strains into N and T types. There was no clear relationship between genotypic distribution and ochratoxigenicity, substrate or geographic origin. The survival of A. carbonarius spores on filter membranes was examined at water activities (aw) 0.4-1.0, and at 1 &#176;C, 15 &#176;C, 25 &#176;C and 37 &#176;C. Survival generally increased at lower temperatures. The lowest water activity, 0.4, best supported the survival of spores, but 0.6- 0.9 aw was often deleterious. Complex interactions between temperature and water activity were observed. Viability of A. carbonarius spores on filter membranes decreased ca 10[superscript 5] fold upon exposure to sunlight, equivalent to 10 mWh of cumulative ultraviolet irradiation at 290-400 nm. Growth and toxin production were examined for five isolates of A. carbonarius and two of A. niger on solid medium simulating juice at early veraison, within the range 0.98-0.92 aw, and at 15 &#176;C, 25 &#176;C, 30 &#176;C and 35 &#176;C. Maximum growth for A. carbonarius and A. niger occurred at ca 0.965 aw / 30 &#176;C and ca 0.98 aw / 35 &#176;C, respectively. The optimum temperature for OA production was 15 &#176;C and little was produced above 25 &#176;C. The optimum aw for toxin production was 0.95 for A. niger and 0.95-0.98 for A. carbonarius. Toxin was produced in young colonies, however, levels were reduced as colonies aged. Black Aspergillus spp. were more commonly isolated from the surface than from the pulp of berries, and increased with berry maturity, or damage. A. niger was isolated more frequently than A. carbonarius and A. aculeatus. Populations of A. carbonarius inoculated onto bunches of Chardonnay and Shiraz decreased from pre-bunch closure to early veraison. Populations from veraison to harvest were variable, and ncreased in bunches with tight clustering and splitting. In a trial with Semillon bunches, omitting fungicide sprays after flowering did not increase the development of Aspergillus rot. Inoculation of bunches with A. carbonarius spore suspension did not necessarily result in Aspergillus bunch rot. In vitro trials suggested that the severity of rot was mediated primarily by the degree of berry damage, followed by the extent of spore coverage. No clear trends regarding cultivar susceptibility were observed. For Semillon bunches inoculated with A. carbonarius spores with and without berry puncture, increased susceptibility to rot and OA formation was associated with berry damage, in particular at greater than 12.3 &#176;Brix (20 d before harvest). OA contamination of bunches was related to the number of mouldy berries per bunch, with shrivelled, severely mouldy berries the primary source of OA. Puncture-inoculation of white grapes (Chardonnay and Semillon) and red grapes (Shiraz) on the vine with A. carbonarius resulted in berries containing OA. Inoculated grapes displayed greater total soluble solids due to berry shrivelling, and greater titratable acidity due to production of citric acid by the fungus. Samples taken throughout vinification of these grapes were analysed for OA. Pressing resulted in the greatest reduction in OA (68-85% decrease in concentration, compared with that of crushed grapes). Additional reductions occurred at racking from grape and gross lees, and after storage. OA was removed by binding to marc, grape and gross lees. Pectolytic enzyme treatment of white must, bentonite juice fining, recovery of juice or wine from lees, and static or rotary style fermentation of red must, had no effect on OA contamination. Bentonite in white wine (containing 56 mg/L grape-derived proteins) and yeast hulls in red wine were effective fining agents for removing OA. Findings from these studies may contribute to the improvement of strategies to minimise OA in Australian wine and dried vine fruit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aspergillus, grapes, toxigenic fungi, mycotoxins, wine and winemaking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37987</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of blackleg disease of canola, caused by Leptosphaeria maculans</field><field name="creator">Naseri, Bita</field><field name="description">Blackleg, caused by L. maculans, is of major economic importance in the canola growing areas of Australia. The aim of this research was to gain information about factors affecting the epidemiology of blackleg in south - eastern Australia. The effect of temperature on a number of aspects of the life cycle of L. maculans was studied in a controlled environment. Germination of ascospores was greater on agar and cotyledons than on leaves, on susceptible cultivars than resistant cultivars, and at 15 and 20 &#176;C than at 5 and 10 &#176;C. Elongation of germ tubes was greater at higher than lower temperatures and generally greater on cotyledons than on leaves of the cultivars after incubation for 24 h at 10 - 20 &#176; C. Temperature had a greater influence than plant organ or cultivar on ascospore germination and the elongation of germ tubes. Temperature, wetness duration, cultivar and leaf position ( leaves 1 - 3 ) influenced the incubation period of L. maculans on canola. Ascospores infected six canola cultivars over 10 - 20 &#176; C following leaf wetness duration of 16 - 72 h. Incubation period ( from inoculation to the appearance of first lesions ) was generally shorter at higher temperatures and following longer wetness periods. Incubation period decreased with increasing leaf age, regardless of the blackleg - resistance rating of the cultivars. Pseudothecia developed on naturally infested canola stubble incubated at 5 - 20 &#176; C under continuous wetness and a 12 h photoperiod. The time taken for pseudothecia to mature after harvest, ranged from 58.3 days at 5 &#176; C to 22.2 days at 15 &#176; C. Fewer pseudothecia developed on stubble incubated in darkness at 15 &#176; C than in light. Pseudothecia took longer to mature when wetness was interrupted than continuous. More ascospores were released at 20 &#176; C than 5 - 15 &#176; C, although peak sporulation occurred earlier at 5 - 10 &#176; C. Discharge of ascospores continued for 8 h at 5 - 10 &#176; C, for 10 h at 15 &#176; C, and for 12 h at 20 &#176; C. The effect of burial of infested canola stubble in sand and field soil ( in pots ) on pathogen survival, pathogenicity and stubble - associated fungi was studied over 13 months in ambient conditions. The isolation frequency of L. maculans from stubble decreased by 63.3 % after 13 months of burial, regardless of soil type. Although the frequency of isolation of L. maculans and Alternaria spp. from stubble decreased over time, that of Stachybotrys chartarum, Fusarium spp. and Coprinus sp. increased substantially over the sampling period. Stubble buried in field soil underwent more decay than in sand over the 13 months. Pseudothecium formation on buried stubble decreased with increasing duration of burial and ceased after 11 months in the field soil and 13 months in sand. The time required for pseudothecia to mature was 25 days for stubble retrieved after one month and 30 days when retrieved 10 months after burial, regardless of soil type. Ascospores from the stubble recovered from burial caused typical Phoma leaf spots on canola over the first 9 months of burial. Over the year, 16 genera of fungi and 12 colony types of bacteria were isolated from the field soil on peptone - rose bengal agar ( PRA ) and on crystal violet agar ( CVA ), respectively. Populations of fungi and bacteria isolated on soil - extract agar were markedly greater than those on PRA and on CVA, respectively. Growth and sporulation of L. maculans on agar media and on infested canola stubble was affected by a variety of fungi obtained from stubble buried in soil or from field soil. Antagonistic activities observed included lysis, deformation, overgrowth and inhibition of L. maculans hyphae, and reduction of pseudothecium density on stubble to one - third or less than that on controls following inoculation with F. equiseti, Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma aureoviride, Sordaria sp. and an unknown Coelomycete. S. chartarum and Coprinus sp. reduced the mass of canola stubble in vitro. Findings will contribute to a better understanding of blackleg and to the development of more effective control measures.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Canola Australia</field><field name="subject">Fungal diseases of plants</field><field name="subject">Phytopathogenic fungi</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Readiness, resilience, and readjustment: a psychological investigation of human factors across the deployment cycle of contemporary peace support operations</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Peter Joseph</field><field name="description">Contemporary peacekeeping missions are complex, demanding, and potentially hazardous. There is general agreement that psychological factors are crucial to effective individual and collective performance of the military personnel deployed in support of these missions. This research has examined the human dimensions associated with capability, functioning, and health across the deployment cycle. The aim of this research was to increase understanding of the psychological issues associated with peace support operations at the individual, group, and organisational levels. The study applied precepts of the transactional model of stress (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984) to the context of military deployment on peace support operations. The overarching Human Dimensions of Operations model for this research incorporated stressor, buffer, and outcome components within the multi-level structure of the military organisation and across the stages (pre, peri, post) of deployment. Participants were Canadian and Australian military personnel deployed on Peace Support Operations. The dissertation comprised seven chapters. Chapter One provided an introduction to the psychological challenges posed by peace support operations and the research opportunities these missions afford. The second chapter detailed the methodology and psychometric evaluation of several measurement scales that were developed as part of this research in order to address the unique characteristics of peace support operations. Each of the six scales examined proved to have a meaningful component structure and adequate subscale reliabilities. The third chapter was devoted to an examination of the psychometric properties of a measure of psychological climate factors, the Unit Climate Profile (UCP), which was the cornerstone instrument of this research. The UCP demonstrated a robust, multi-dimensional structure that was conceptually concordant with its theoretical development and design. In addition, the component structure of the UCP changed in meaningful ways according to its level of analysis - individual or group. The next three chapters examined human dimension constructs at different stages of deployment, notably psychological readiness for operations, psychological resilience during deployment, and readjustment following return from deployment. In Chapter Four, the most compelling structural model that examined collective psychological readiness demonstrated that perceptions of readiness at the group level, along with effective senior leadership, could significantly impact morale. The results in Chapter Five revealed that leadership both buffered the immediate impact of stressors, and also fostered meaning and morale, thereby reducing strain. Positive aspects of deployment and the personal meaning assumed to be derived from these experiences were also found to bolster morale significantly during deployment. In Chapter Six, the stressors specific to the postdeployment transition phase, rather than stressors encountered during deployment, had the strongest impact on postdeployment adjustment. Social support and a positive psychological climate in the unit (particularly evidenced by cohesiveness and caring behaviour by proximal leaders) moderated the impact of homecoming stressors. A concluding chapter summarised the dissertation and discussed its practical significance and avenues for the dissemination of its findings. Broadly, the outcomes demonstrated that an understanding of the human factors in military units within the context of the stressors-strain relationship can provide potentially useful information to commanders who want to enhance the well-being, performance, and commitment of Service members deployed on peace support operations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">psychological readiness, psychological resilience, readjustment, peacekeeping, deployment, Australian Defence Force, unit climate</field><field name="subject">Armed Forces in foreign countries Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Peacekeeping forces Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Military</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A radical reconsideration of serialism and chord stranding, applied to a personal jazz style (CD recordings and exegesis)</field><field name="creator">Martin, Christopher Robert</field><field name="description">Despite a widely held view that serialism is incompatible with jazz improvisation, there are many instances of jazz musicians successfully engaging with this concept. This conflict seems likely to have arisen from differing interpretations of &#8216;serialism&#8217;; however, the question of how a jazz improviser&#8217;s approach to serialism might, or perhaps should, differ from a classical composer&#8217;s, has been left unasked. In addition, most attempts at the use of serialism within improvisation remain undocumented by the musicians concerned. The chord stranding techniques of Lutoslawski are less well known and less controversial than serialism. Connections between Lutoslawski&#8217;s twelve-note chords and traditional twelve-note rows are obvious, as are connections between the concept of harmonic &#8216;strands&#8217; and the jazz harmonic device of superimposition. The possibilities for use of Lutoslawski&#8217;s ideas within a jazz context are interesting and worthy of consideration. This research project involves the composition and performance of jazz pieces applying serialism and chord stranding, as well as the exploration of precedents for these ideas within the jazz tradition. The four CD recordings within this thesis present the initial development of these concepts (CDs 1 and 2); an exploration of serialism in the music of John Coltrane (CD 3); and an album of original material demonstrating the integrated application of these concepts (CD 4). The exegesis describes the broader context of this project and examines the relevant music theory concepts. It uses analysis of transcriptions to show the specific application of techniques. The key outcomes from this research are (i) the development and (ii) the demonstration of techniques for pitch organisation based on serialism and chord stranding that are appropriate for jazz improvisation. The recordings and exegesis show the successful integration of these techniques with existing melodic and harmonic ideas familiar to jazz musicians. It is argued that the approach to jazz improvisation explored within this research represents a novel and radical reinterpretation of the traditional concept of serialism and that this approach is helpful when considering the effective use of serialism in a jazz context. From a broader perspective, this research offers a case study of an improviser grappling with the challenges of synthesis and stylistic integrity and, as such, it has the potential to inform contemporary debates concerning tradition and innovation within jazz.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music; performance; jazz; serialism; chord stranding; Lutoslawski; composition; improvisation</field><field name="subject">Jazz.</field><field name="subject">Jazz 2001-2010</field><field name="subject">Improvisation (Music)</field><field name="subject">Serialism (Music)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49474</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49474</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and assessment of computer-game-like tests of human cognitive abilities.</field><field name="creator">McPherson, Jason</field><field name="description">The present thesis describes the development and assessment of two computer-game-like tests designed to measure two cognitive abilities currently of considerable interest to many researchers: processing speed (Gs) and working memory (WM). It is hoped that such tests could provide a unique and important addition to the range of tests currently employed by researchers interested in these constructs. The results of five separate studies are presented across three published papers. In Paper 1-Study 1 (N = 49) a speeded computerized coding test (Symbol Digit) using the mouse as the response device was assessed. Because speeded tests are thought to be highly sensitive to response methods (Mead &amp; Drasgow, 1994) it was deemed important to first assess how a mouse response method might affect the underlying construct validity of a speeded coding test independently of whether it was game-like. Factor analytic results indicated that the computerized coding test loaded strongly on the same factor as paper-andpencil measures of Gs. For Paper 2-Study 1 (N = 68) a more computer-game-like version of Symbol Digit was developed, Space Code. Development of Space Code involved the provision of a cover story, the replacing of code symbols with &#8216;spaceship&#8217; graphics, the situating of the test within an overall &#8216;spaceship cockpit&#8217;, and numerous other graphical and aural embellishments to the task. Factor analytic results indicated that Space Code loaded strongly on a Gs factor but also on a factor comprised of visuo-spatial (Gv) ability tests. This finding was further investigated in the subsequent study. Paper 2-Study 2 (N = 74) involved a larger battery of ability marker tests and a range of additional computer-game-like elements were added to Space Code. Space Code included a scoring system, a timer with additional voice synthesized countdowns, aversive feedback for errors, and background music. Factor analysis indicated that after a general factor was extracted Space Code loaded on the same factor as paper-and-pencil measures of Gs and did not load on a factor comprised of non-speeded Gv tests. Paper 3-Study 1 (N = 74) was aimed at assessing a computer-game-like test of WM (Space Matrix) and further assessing Space Code within a broader network of tests. Space Matrix used a dual task format combining a simple version of Space Code with a visually presented memory task based on the Dot Matrix test (Miyake, Friedman, Rettinger, Shah, &amp; Hegarty, 2001). The cover story and scoring system for Space Code was expanded to incorporate this additional memory element. Factor analysis indicated that Space Matrix was loaded on the same first order factor as standard WM tests and the Raven&#8217;s Advanced Progressive Matrices (Gf). Space Code was substantially loaded on the second order factor but was weakly loaded on each of two first order factors interpreted as Gs and WM/Gf. A final study is presented (Paper 3-Study2) in which Space Code and Space Matrix was administered to a school aged sample (N=94). Space Matrix exhibited construct validity as well as predictive validity (as a predictor of school grades), while results for Space Code were less encouraging. Space Matrix and Raven&#8217;s Progressive Matrices showed comparable relationships to school grades for Mathematics, English and Science subjects. It is concluded that the development of computer-game-like tests represents a promising new format for research and applied assessment of known cognitive abilities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cognitive abilities; computer games; computer-game-like; computerised assessment; CHC; intelligence; psychological assessment</field><field name="subject">Cognition Testing.</field><field name="subject">Neuropsychological tests.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient sensing mechanisms in the small intestine : localisation of taste molecules in mice and humans with and without diabetes.</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kate</field><field name="description">The mucosa of the small intestine is clearly able to discriminate specific chemical components of ingested meals to stimulate gastrointestinal feedback pathways and reduce further food intake. Luminal carbohydrates delay gastric emptying and initiate satiation, which are mediated by reflexes via the vagus nerve upon activation of vagal afferent endings in the mucosa. Nutrients activate these nerve fibres through intermediary epithelial cells, which release neuromediators upon transduction of luminal signals through the apical membrane. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are released from enteroendocrine cells in response to luminal carbohydrates and both slow gastric emptying and inhibit food intake via vagal afferent pathways. The molecular mechanisms for carbohydrate detection and transduction leading to 5-HT and GLP-1 release are unknown. However molecules key to transduction of taste by receptor cells in the lingual epithelium are expressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The studies in this thesis aimed to investigate 1) the possibility that taste molecules expressed in the intestine form part of the carbohydrate sensing pathway that leads to 5-HT and GLP-1 release, which in turn activate mucosal vagal afferents and 2) to gauge any alterations in taste molecule expression that may relate to adaptation of carbohydrate-induced gastric motility reflexes that occurs in dietary and disease states. Firstly these studies show key taste molecules, including sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3, the Gprotein gustducin (alpha-subunit G&#945;gust), and the taste transduction channel TRPM5, are expressed in the mouse gastrointestinal mucosa shown by RT-PCR and were further localised to individual epithelial &#8216;taste&#8217; cells using immunohistochemistry. Quantification of transcript levels by real time RT-PCR revealed the proximal small intestine as the preferential site of sweet taste receptor expression along the gastrointestinal tract. This finding was also confirmed in humans using gastric and intestinal mucosal biopsies obtained at enteroscopy with significantly higher transcript expression levels in the small intestine compared to stomach. In the mouse, double label immunohistochemistry with G&#945;[subscript]gust antibody, as a marker of intestinal taste cells, was performed using lectin UEA-1, a marker of intestinal brush cells, and 5-HT or GLP-1 to link intestinal taste transduction to 5-HT and GLP-1 release. Results show G&#945;[subscript]gust is expressed within a subset of all three cell types in the small intestine but predominantly within UEA-1-expressing cells. Although G&#945;[subscript]gust, 5-HT and GLP-1 are largely expressed in mutually exclusive cells, within the jejunum a portion G&#945;gust positive cells coexpressed 5-HT or GLP-1. This Indicates a subpopulation of intestinal taste cells may be dedicated to carbohydrate-evoked gastrointestinal reflexes through 5-HT and GLP-1 mediated pathways, however, taste transduction within the small intestine appears to predominantly link to alternate mediators. After nutrient detection at the luminal surface, activation of mucosal afferents by 5-HT released from enterochromaffin cells is well documented, however although vagal afferents express GLP-1 receptors direct activation has not been demonstrated. For this purpose the effects of GLP-1 on gastrointestinal vagal afferents were investigated through single fibre recordings in in vitro tissue preparations. GLP-1 had no effect on the activity of mouse gastroesophageal vagal afferents but a rat duodenal preparation proved too problematic to be able to test GLP-1 specifically on duodenal vagal afferents. Altered gastric motility in response to carbohydrate meals due to prior dietary patterns and diabetes mellitus suggest adaptation in feedback mechanisms. Towards the second aim of this thesis taste molecule expression was quantified in fed and fasted mice by real time RT-PCR and revealed taste gene transcription is altered with the changing luminal environment, specifically transcription of taste genes was significantly decreased after feeding compared to the fasted state. Studies comparing expression in the duodenum of type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic controls show no significant difference in taste transcript levels between the two groups. However taste molecule expression was correlated to blood glucose levels in diabetics suggesting transcription of these signal molecules is adapted to both luminal and systemic carbohydrate levels. Findings in both the mouse and human gastrointestinal tract in terms of intestinal chemosensing are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastrointestinal chemosensation; taste molecules; enteroendocrine cells; vagal afferent</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59982</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface reconstruction from three dimensional range data.</field><field name="creator">Myers, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the problem of reconstructing a single surface representation from multiple range images acquired from a terrestrial laser scanner. A solution to this problem is important to industries such as mining, where accurate spatial measurement is required for mapping and volumetric calculations. Laser scanners for 3D measurement are now commercially available and software for deriving useful information from the data these devices generate is essential. A reconstruction technique based on an implicit surface representation of the range images and a polygonisation algorithm called marching triangles has been implemented in software and its performance investigated. This work improves upon the existing techniques in that it takes into account the particular differences of terrestrial range data as compared with data from small scale laser scanners. The implementation is robust with respect to noisy data and environments and requires minimal user input. A new approach to 3D spatial indexing is also developed to allow rapid evaluation of the true closest point to a surface which is the basis of the signed distance function implicit surface representation. A new technique for locating step discontinuities in the range image is presented, which caters for the varying sampling densities of terrestrial range images. The algorithm is demonstrated using representative range images acquired for surface erosion monitoring and for underground mine surveying. The results indicate that this reconstruction technique represents an improvement over current techniques for this type of range data.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatial indexing, marching triangles algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60144</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the development and hormonal regulation of the ovarian lymphatic vasculature.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Hannah Mary</field><field name="description">The ovary provides a niche environment where female germ cells (or oocytes) are generated, stored within follicles and later matured in preparation for use during reproductive life. Following an extensive period of quiescence, which in human, may be up to forty years; the follicle surrounding the oocyte begins to grow, promoting maturation of the oocyte, and culminating in the expulsion of a fully mature oocyte in preparation for fertilisation. These events occur cyclically as part of the menstrual (or estrus) cycle and involve extensive remodelling of both the follicle and its surrounding extracellular tissue. Cyclic follicle activation and growth is also associated with concurrent remodelling of the blood vasculature within the ovary, specifically the vessels surrounding the growing follicle. These blood vascular remodelling changes are well explored and have been demonstrated to be necessary for follicle growth, hormone synthesis, ovulation and for the development and function of the corpus luteum. Physiologically, the lymphatic vasculature is known to closely interact with the blood vasculature and plays a number of important physiological roles including the return of extra-vascular fluid to the blood circulation, and in turn, maintenance of systemic fluid homeostasis. Additionally the lymphatic network is required for the trafficking of immune cells from the periphery to lymph nodes; during the initiation of an immune response and for the absorption of lipids and lipid soluble vitamins in the gastrointestinal tract. The lymphatic vasculature develops and functions concomitantly with the blood vasculature; however unlike the blood vasculature, the aetiology of lymphatic vasculature within the ovary is unknown. It is unclear whether lymphatic remodelling events occur in association with folliculogenesis and are necessary for fertility, as is seen with the blood vasculature. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in the establishment and remodelling of the lymphatic vasculature within the ovary, I undertook expansive characterisation of its development and hormonal regulation. I exploited both hormonal manipulation and a known model of disrupted ovarian lymphatic development, the Adamts1 null mouse line, to examine the mechanisms controlling ovarian lymphangiogenesis. Quantitative morphometric analysis of vessel size and number in postnatal mouse ovary revealed that the ovarian lymphatic vasculature develops postnatally between day 8.5 and 12.5, and in synchrony with induction of ovarian CYP19a1 (Aromatase); the time when secondary follicles become FSH-responsive and estrogenic. The establishment of the lymphatic vasculature was also associated with the induction of pro-lymphangiogenic growth factors Vegfc and Vegfd, and their receptor, Vegfr3. Formation of ovarian lymphatics required the matrix-remodelling protease Adamts1, since ovaries from Adamts1&#8315;/&#8315; mice failed to undergo normal lymphatic vascular development. FSH promoted remodelling of the existing lymphatic vascular maturation by increasing lymphatic vessel size in normal (Adamts1&#8314;/&#8315;) ovaries, and promoted the expansion of a new lymphatic vascular network by increasing vessel number and size in Adamts1&#8315;/&#8315; ovaries. These vessel changes were also associated with the induction of prolymphangiogenic factors, Vegfc and Vegfd, as well as their receptor, Vegfr3 providing a mechanistic explanation for the hormonal mediated lymphangiogenesis. The concurrent establishment of the lymphatic vasculature with the first postnatal induction of ovarian Aromatase, and the hormone-regulated lymphangiogenesis suggests that a hormonal communication, likely estrogen, may synchronise lymphangiogenesis with folliculogenesis. Like FSH, exogenous estradiol was able to promote the expansion of a new lymphatic vascular network by increasing vessel number and size in Adamts1&#8315;/&#8315; ovaries. Additionally, FSH-analog eCG was able to enhance ovarian lymphangiogenesis during the window of lymphatic establishment (postnatal development of Adamts1 null), whilst inhibition of the production of estradiol using the Aromatase inhibitor Letrozole, during this same window failed to have any effect. This study is the first to investigate the relationship between ovarian lymphatic development and remodelling and folliculogenesis. The present studies reveal that the ovary undergoes lymphatic vascular remodelling, described elsewhere as adult or secondary lymphangiogenesis and that this process involves hormonal contributions from FSH and estradiol, as well as the extracellular matrix protease, Adamts1. This work provides the first evidence of a malleable lymphatic system and a model for regulation of normal adult lymphangiogenesis, and may one day be used to explore ways in which to regenerate damaged vessels to cure lymphatic diseases and disorders. These results also significantly advanced the understanding of the tightly regulated processes controlling fluid dynamics within the ovary.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lymphatic; ovary; hormone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of oxidation reaction kinetics during an air injection process.</field><field name="creator">Das, Shyamol Chandra</field><field name="description">Air injection is an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process in which compressed air is injected into a high temperature, light-oil reservoir. The oxygen in injected air is intended to react with a fraction of reservoir oil at elevated temperature resulting in in-situ generation of flue gases and steam, which, in turn, mobilize and drive the oil ahead towards the producing wells. To understand and determine the feasibility of the air injection process application to a given reservoir, it is necessary to understand the oxidation behaviour of the crude oil. The aim of this study is to screen two Australian light-oil reservoirs; Kenmore Oilfield, Eromanga Basin, and another Australian onshore oil and gas field &#8220;B&#8221;* for air injection EOR process, and to understand the oxidation reaction kinetics during air injection. It is carried out by the thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric (TGA/DSC) studies to investigate the oxidation mechanism during an air injection process. There has not been any TGA/DSC evaluation conducted to date with regard to air injection for Australian light-oil reservoirs. A series of thermal tests was performed to investigate the oxidation behaviour of two selected reservoirs in both air and oxygen environments. The first step undertaken in this study is thermogravimetric and calorimetric characterization of crude oils to (i) identify the temperature range over which the oil reacts with oxygen, (ii) examine the oxidation behaviour within the temperature identified, and (iii) evaluate the mass loss characteristics during the oxidation. This study also examines the effect of pressure on oxidation at different temperature ranges and the effect of core material (rock cutting) on oxidation reactions. Finally, kinetic data are calculated from thermal tests results by literature described method. Kenmore and Field B both are high temperature and light-oil reservoirs. Hydrocarbon distribution indicates that Kenmore oil contains 84 mole% of lower carbon number n-C&#8325; - n-C&#8321; &#8323; compounds. Reservoir B oil also contains a substantial amount (i.e., 95 mole %) of lower carbon number n-C&#8324;  - C&#8321; &#8329; compounds. These lighter components may contribute favourably towards efficient oxidation. However, a high content of lighter ends in the oil may also result in a lower fuel load. Generally, low molecular weight oil gives fastest mass loss from heavy crude oil. Thermal tests on Kenmore oil showed two distinct exothermic reactivity regions in temperatures of 200-340&#176;C and 360-450&#176;C, with a 85-95% mass loss when the temperature reached 450&#176;C. Reservoir B oil showed a wider exotherm range between approximately 180&#176;C-260&#176;C with 90-95% mass loss by temperature 350&#176;C. In the high temperature range, the combustion reactions of Reservoir B oil are weaker than Kenmore oil. This is due to insufficient fuel available for oxidations in high temperature region. Reservoir B oil has more chance to auto ignite; but it has less sustainability to the ignition process. Based on the sustainability study of the ignition process, between the two reservoirs, Kenmore is the better candidate for air injection. Based on the thermal tests, it is concluded that for light-oil oxidation, vaporization is the dominant physical phenomenon. At low temperature range, the addition of the core material enhanced the exothermic reactions of the oil. The elevated pressure accelerated the bond scission reactions. The largest amount and highest rate of energy generation occurred at the low temperature range. Activation energies (E) are calculated from thermal test results and the value of &#8216;E&#8217; in oil-with-core combined tests is smaller than the oil-only test. This indicates that the rock material has a positive impact on the combustion process. Moreover, the compositional analysis result addresses the composition of oils, which can help understand the oxidation behaviour of light-oils. * For confidentiality reasons, the field name is coded as Field B at the request of the operating company.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">air injection; reaction kinetics; EOR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60192</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of tooth wear: preventive strategies.</field><field name="creator">Ranjitkar, Sarbin</field><field name="description">There is an increasing awareness in clinical dentistry of the need to better understand the aetiology and management of tooth wear, as increasing numbers of elderly patients are retaining their natural teeth to a stage when they present with extensive wear. In addition, more younger patients are presenting with wear of both primary and permanent teeth. In order to comply with the philosophy of minimal intervention dentistry, clinical management of tooth wear should focus on early detection and prevention before a restorative approach is considered. Fluoride is a commonly used agent in the management of tooth wear, with previous studies showing that it can protect teeth against erosion (at around pH 2.0 and 3.0) and toothbrush abrasion in an acidic environment (at around pH 3.0). However, it does not reduce attritional wear between opposing tooth specimens. Nightguards are commonly used to prevent attritional wear but there is still a need to improve preventive strategies to manage the risk of erosive tooth wear. Previous in vitro studies have shown that a remineralizing agent in the form of CPP-ACP (casein phosphopeptide &#8211; amorphous calcium phosphate) can reduce erosion of both enamel and dentine by white wine. A recent study has also highlighted the potential lubricating and remineralizing properties of a CPP-ACP containing paste (Tooth Mousse&#174;, G C Asia Pty Ltd) in reducing dentine wear in both an acidic environment (pH 3.0) and a near neutral environment (pH 6.1). In this context, it is desirable to investigate the effect of CPP-ACP on enamel wear under conditions simulating various clinical situations and to better understand the nature of third-body components at the wear interface. The aims of the present study were: (i) to determine the effect of CPP-ACP on enamel wear under conditions simulating three clinical situations: heavy attrition with gastric regurgitation (at pH 1.2); toothbrush abrasion after an erosive episode (at pH 3.2); and erosion from gastric regurgitation (at pH 1.2), and (ii) to clarify its mode of action by characterizing the enamel surface treated with CPP-ACP. Electro-mechanical tooth wear machines were used to simulate attrition and toothbrush abrasion in combination with erosion, but no machine was used in experiments investigation erosion alone. The effect of paste containing CPP-ACP in reducing erosive tooth wear was also compared with that without CPP-ACP. Enamel surfaces with and without treatment with CPP-ACP were then characterized by using Time of Flight &#8211; Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). CPP-ACP was found to reduce enamel wear under conditions simulating heavy attrition combined with gastric regurgitation, and toothbrush abrasion after an erosive episode. However, it did not protect enamel from erosion under conditions simulating gastric regurgitation alone, indicating that its lubricating effect was more pronounced than its remineralizing effect. Silicone and ethyl siloxane were present in trace amounts on the enamel surface treated with Tooth Mousse&#174;, thus they were found to be included in its formulation. These findings imply that CPP-ACP nanocomplexes and silicon can act as third body components to lubricate the wear interface. The findings presented in this thesis have implications for clinical management of tooth wear and may lead to new strategies of tooth wear prevention. Although some caution is needed in extrapolating these findings to the in vivo situation, it should be noted that in vitro studies provide valuable insights into separate components of the tooth wear process that are often difficult to distinguish in clinical situations. Overall, this thesis provides new information about the role of CPP-ACP in reducing erosive enamel wear and provides a basis for future experimental and clinical studies focussing on tooth wear prevention.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tooth wear; attrition; abrasion; erosion; demineralization; CPP-ACP; remineralization; lubrication; Tof-SIMS; experimental studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60253</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructor attention to oral reading errors: a functional analysis</field><field name="creator">McNaughton, Stuart, 1950</field><field name="description">The effect of attention to oral reading errors has received little specific examination by researchers in applied behaviour analysis. Some data suggest attending to such errors can have inappropriate effects on learning. A conceptual framework was developed to examine the effects of error attention on the acquisition of proficient reading responses. Analyses of reading behaviour employed concepts and data from 'structural' accounts of reading. These concepts provided details of the components of response systems. Acquisition of proficient reading was seen to involve trends towards accurate integrated responding which becomes self controlled. Error attention was conceptualised as having motivational and informational properties which could directly affect acquisition trends. The first experiment (Chapter Three) demonstrated that under appropriate conditions oral reading behaviour was facilitated by error attention. Eleven year old readers in a Learning Disabilities classroom were measured in their usual reading setting. Two readers received extra tutoring with error attention procedures. A further two readers acted as a contrast for the effects of increased opportunities to respond. These readers received extra practice tutoring with minimum levels of praise. A third subject received no extra tutoring during the course of the experiment. Results indicated that both practice and error attention produced substantial increases in accuracy and correct rates. Accuracy levels were higher for error attention subjects suggesting error attention can have important learning outcomes. Additionally, predictions concerning the error attention dimensions of modeling and prompting were tested. Prompts were found to be more effective with the more proficient reader while models were more effective with the less proficient reader. The second experiment (Chapter Four) examined specific predictions about timing of error attention. Six, 6 year old normal readers received daily sessions of either delayed or immediate attention to errors. Every second day the subjects also read a text on which they were not tutored. Results showed that delayed attention increased the percent of errors self corrected for five subjects in both the tutored and non tutored texts. Increases in self corrections were consistently associated with increased accuracy. The data supported both the predictions and the proposed model of self correction behaviour as having a tutorial or self instruction function. Both experiments were discussed in terms of the functions of error attention in facilitating acquisition of proficient reading. Methodological issues in the behaviour analysis of oral reading were also discussed and implications from the studies for instruction in learning to read are drawn. The usefulness of concepts from 'structural' accounts of reading for a predictive 'functional' account of error attention is examined in a concluding section.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of reef-associated predators on adjacent soft-sediment communities</field><field name="creator">Langlois, Timothy John</field><field name="description">&#8216;Infaunal haloes&#8217; of either decreasing or increasing abundances of individual soft-sediment species with distance from reefs have been suggested to be caused by reef-associated predators. A large-scale mensurative experiment was used to investigate the distribution of two size classes of macrofauna with distance from the reef edge across three locations in northeastern New Zealand. The role of reef-associated predators, the snapper (Pagrus auratus Sparidae) and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii Palinuridae), was investigated using established marine reserves at each location. Consistent patterns were found in a few large-bodied fauna. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, whilst the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea were more abundant further away from the reef. Dosinia subrosea and another bivalve, Myadora striata, exhibited lower biomass at sites with higher densities of snapper and rock lobster. In contrast, small-bodied macrofauna showed no consistent patterns with distance from the reef or among sites with different predator populations. It was hypothesised that predation was driving the distribution of large bivalves. An experiment was done to investigate this model using D. subrosea. Equal densities of this bivalve were established in plots either with or without cages at sites either inside or outside of reserves. Significant predation was detected, but only inside reserves. Much of this mortality could be specifically attributed to predation by large rock lobsters, given the distinctive marks on the valves of dead D. subrosea. Inside reserves, predators are not only more abundant but also larger. It was hypothesised that different size classes of predators would result in different levels of predation. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate this model. Lobsters of all sizes chose D. subrosea over the heavier shelled D. anus. Small lobsters chose to prey on small D. subrosea and large lobsters more frequently chose larger prey. The distributions of these two bivalve species at protected (large predators) and fished sites (small predators) reflected the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. Results suggested that rock lobster populations are capable, where their size structure is not truncated by fishing pressure, of controlling population-level dynamics of bivalve communities adjacent to reefs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1894</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological adaptation in the radiation of New Zealand triplefin fishes (Family Tripterygiidae)</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Zoe</field><field name="description">Physiological adaptation to divergent environments is a poorly understood factor in adaptive radiation. New Zealand (NZ) triplefin fishes (Tripterygiidae) have undergone a radiation associated with habitat diversification within NZ's coastal waters, where 26 closely-related endemic species occur in overlapping but divergent habitats, partitioned by depth and exposure. By investigating the relationship between respiratory physiological traits and habitat in these fishes, this thesis examines whether there is evidence in this group to support two proposed criteria for adaptive radiation; phenotype-environment correlation and trait utility. Significant interspecific differences were observed in rates of oxygen consumption (VO2) and critical oxygen concentration (O2 crit) in 12 species of triplefin examined. O2 crit correlated with species' habitat depth, with intertidal species displaying greater hypoxia tolerance than subtidal species, thus demonstrating phenotype-environment correlation and trait utility in relation to hypoxia exposure. Interspecific differences in VO2 were significantly influenced by phylogeny, indicating a lack of strong environmental selection on VO2. However, there was some indication of lower VO2 in species occupying more exposed habitats. Mitochondrial respiration was also examined in three species; the intertidal species displayed higher cytochrome c oxidase activity and was able to maintain efficient oxidative phosphorylation at higher temperatures than the two subtidal species, further indicating phenotype-environment correlation and trait utility. Haemoglobin (Hb) isoform expression was examined in 23 species. Isoform multiplicity declined with habitat depth, supporting the hypothesis that higher multiplicity may be associated with greater environmental variability. A lack of phylogenetic signal in Hb expression, and latitudinal variation in the relative isoform abundance in some species, indicated potential selection on this trait. However, there was no pattern in expression of cathodal Hbs, and the trait utility of this multiplicity is unknown. Overall, there is strong evidence that differences between intertidal and subtidal environments in exposure to high temperatures and hypoxia may have lead to divergence in O2 crit and mitochondrial function between intertidal and subtidal species. Therefore physiological adaptation may have enabled the expansion of species into the more demanding habitats such as the intertidal zone. Hb isoform multiplicity and VO2 were correlated with habitat in both intertidal and subtidal species, however the trait utility associated with these correlations is unknown and thus there remains a lack of evidence to support a direct role of physiological adaptation in habitat divergence of subtidal species - and therefore for adaptive radiation of the group as a whole.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5902</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incorporating Student Self-reports in Functional Assessment</field><field name="creator">Villec, Desiree</field><field name="description">Interventions created to alter challenging behaviour should be preceded by a thorough investigation into the purpose of the behaviour.

The study affirms inscriptions surrounding choice in childbirth are shaped discursively through a multiplicity of discourses underpinned by social and institutional practices. With advances in technology, childbearing women have a greater variety of options from which to choose. Controversial, is the option of a caesarean section, regardless of clinical need. The issue is depicted in both professional and popular discourse as contentious, complex and contradictory. Its momentum into the 21st century, as a new object of obstetric discourse, has been played out on a number of platforms. In this thesis I draw from the theoretical ideas of French philosopher Michel Foucault, to examine this complex debate. I argue there is a volatile moment in the history of childbirth in which an explosion of discourses have sculptured choice for a caesarean, in the absence of clinical indications, out of a repartee of autonomy, convenience, desire, fear and risk. In this precarious moment, new meanings joust with the old on a shifting terrain awash with rhetoric that co-opts, competes, and contradicts to bring about a cach&#233; of mutable &#8216;truths&#8217;. Whether caesarean, as an optional extra, can be explained in terms of a libertarian imperative, an embodiment of lifestyle, the satiation of desire, the attenuation of fear or the avoidance of risk, the democratisation of this choice has exposed a pathologising paradox, whereupon the normal emerges as the abnormal, and the abnormal emerges as the normal. The deconstruction of choice through a poststructuralist lens has enabled insight into how contradiction and contest befall the &#8216;order of things &#8217; and in so doing, provides new openings for contemplating the discursive positioning of women through the competing discourses of childbirth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">caesarean section</field><field name="subject">childbirth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/670</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive behaviour of Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae : a thesis presented in partial fulfi[l]ment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science (Entomology) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">He, Xiong Zhao</field><field name="description">Aphidius ervi Haliday is a cosmopolitan parasitoid species of several major aphid pests on economically important crops. Prior to this research, little information was available on its reproductive behaviour. Emergence of A. ervi peaks during the first few hours of the photophase with males being protandrous. Females become sexually mature earlier than males and oviposit primarily in the photophase. Aphids parasitised in their early instars die before reproduction but those parasitised in later instars produce a limited number of progeny. Females prefer aphids of 3- to 5-d-old over the younger and older aphids for oviposition. Females ovipositing in 4- to 7-d-old aphids have more fitness gains in terms of progeny body size and egg load at emergence. Fertilised eggs are more likely deposited in large hosts and unfertilised eggs in small ones. Large individuals have greater longevity, large males father more progeny, and large females have higher fecundity, parasitism and greater ability in host searching. However, with increasing body size females gain more than males in longevity and fecundity but males gain more than females in the number of female progeny. Males can inseminate up to nine females and they carry about 82% effective sperm at emergence and replenish about 18% sperm during their adult life. Females adjust the oviposition and sex allocation strategies in response to increasing host density with higher number of aphids parasitised at higher host densities and lower proportion of female progeny produced at lower host densities. Males play an active role in mating behaviour. Males having mating experience, and being large or younger, respond to females more quickly and perform better courtships resulting in higher mating success. Males prefer larger and younger females for mating probably because the latter have greater reproductive potential. Males optimize the use of their sperm based on the availability of their sperm and the reproductive status (age) of females. The switchingoff of female receptivity of male mating attempt after the mating is a gradual process. Some females accept the second males within 1 minute since the termination of the first mating. The shorter mating period in the second mating suggests that females remate probably due to the gradual process of switching-off of female receptivity rather than the insufficient sperm transformation during the first mating. Males prolong their mating duration in male-biased operational sex ratio to reduce the probability of female remating.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aphids</field><field name="subject">Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/749</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What underpins success in a health promoting school in Northeastern Thailand? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Chamusri, Somsaowanuch</field><field name="description">A Health Promoting School (HPS) approach is now widely accepted internationally, with a focus on children&#8217;s health, the school curriculum, and whole school environment. In Thailand, the health and well-being of children is a fundamental value. HPS programmes have been implemented in schools as a strategy to focus on young people&#8217;s health. A number of barriers to successful HPS have been identified. While there is international evidence to show the steps and the key factors in creating successful HPS, little is known about successful HPS in the Thai context, in particular, in Northeastern Thailand which has been classified the poorest region. Ethnographic methods were used to examine what understanding of the meaning of HPS is necessary for a successful school, and how all those involved acted from the adoption of the HPS programmes by the local school until it achieved HPS status. A rural school which was successful in a HPS programme was selected, in Mahasarakham province, Northeastern Thailand. The data were obtained through participant observation, ethnographic interviews, and ethnographic records, and data analysis took place simultaneously with data collection. In this study, Lofland&#8217;s strategy for the analysis of the structure of human interaction was used. A variety of techniques for improving and documenting the credibility of the study such as prolonged engagement, persistent observation, and triangulation were used. This research revealed that the informants&#8217; views reflected diverse understandings of the meaning of HPS. Those views were based on their experiences of HPS which differed according to the degree of participation, different levels of knowledge about HPS, and in the roles they played in the implementation of HPS in the school. Thai culture and school ethos influenced the success of HPS. Community participation was also crucial in supporting the school&#8217;s achievement. Key factors that underpinned success are identified.

To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A transformational model to understand the impact of enterprise systems for business benefits : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Technology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mathrani, Sanjay</field><field name="description">Over the years many organizations have implemented an enterprise system (ES), also called enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, to streamline the flow of information and improve organizational effectiveness to produce business benefits which justify the ES investment. The effectiveness of these systems to achieve benefits is an area being proactively researched by both professionals and academia. However, most of these studies focus on &#8216;what ESs do&#8217; rather than &#8216;how ESs do it&#8217;. The purpose of this study is to better understand how organizations derive benefits from utilization of an ES and its data. This study utilizes a transformational model of how ES data are transformed into knowledge and results to evaluate the impact of ES information on organizational functions and processes and how this can lead to business benefits. The linkage between expected outcomes, utilization of ES data in decision-making processes, and realized or unrealized benefits provides the reason for this study. Findings reveal that the key benefits commercial firms seek from an ES include improving information flow and visibility, integration and automation of functions, cost reductions by reducing inventory, and achieving process efficiencies for both internal and external operations. The various tools and methods businesses use for transforming ES data into knowledge include the use of data warehouses and business intelligence modules that assist in extraction and manipulation of data, and reporting on particular data objects. Web portals are actively utilized to collaborate between stakeholders and access real-time information. Business tools such as KPI reporting, balanced scorecards and dashboards are used to track progress towards realizing benefits and establishing analytical decision making. Findings emphasize that benefit realization from an ES implementation is a holistic process that not only includes the essential data and technology factors, but also includes other factors such as business strategy deployment, people and process management, and skills and competency development. Findings reveal that business organizations generally lack in producing value assessments that often lead to weak business cases and insufficient benefit models which cannot be used for benefit tracking. However, these organizations are now realizing that it is not enough to put in an ES and expect an automatic improvement. Organizations are now establishing analytical and knowledge-leveraging processes to optimize and realize business value from their ES investment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterprise system</field><field name="subject">Enterprise resource planning system</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Organisational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1368</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late quaternary lahars from Mount Ruapehu in the Whangaehu River, North Island, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosoophy in Soil Science at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Katherine Anne</field><field name="description">The stratigraphic record of lahars in the Whangaehu River reveals that in the past 180,000 years this route has been one of the main conduits for lahars from Mount Ruapehu, the highest active andesitic stratovolcano in the Central North Island of New Zealand. Both debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows have engulfed surfaces up to 160 km distance from the Volcano. Eight episodes of laharic activity are recognized by the distinctive lithology and similar age of their deposits. The newly defined upper Pleistocene Whangaehu Formation provides evidence for the earliest lahar event in the Valley, c. 180,000- 140,000 years ago. There is only meagre evidence for laharic activity following this event until the Ohakean and Holocene, although two new informally named deposits - the Mangatipona pumice sand (c. 37,000 years B.P.) and Apitian lahars (c. 32,000-25,500 years B.P) - are recognized, of minor extent. The formerly defined late Quaternary Te Heuheu (c. 25,500- 14,700 years B.P.), Tangatu (c. 14,700-5,370 years B.P.), Manutahi (c. 5 ,370-3,4600 years B.P.), Mangaio (c. 4,600 years B.P.) and Onetapu (&lt; c. 1,850 years B.P.) Formations are here described and interpreted. Triggering mechanisms for lahar deposits are distinguished based on lithological criteria. (a) Bouldery deposits in the Whangaehu Formation are interpreted to have been emplaced by a single highly competent debris flow triggered by a southerly-directed flank collapse at Mount Ruapehu. This debris flow was competent enough to transport boulders up to 2 m in diameter over 140 km from the Volcano. Bouldery deposits are also recognized in the Onetapu Formation, but are restricted to higher gradient surfaces on the Mount Ruapehu ring plain. The Onetapu Formation deposits are interpreted to have been emplaced by lahars resulting from catastrophic drainage of Crater Lake, which occupies the active crater on Mount Ruapehu. (b) Pebbly and sandy deposits are interpreted to have been emplaced by low competence debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows. These lahar deposits are recognized in all formations described. The lithology in these deposits is commonly pumice and they are interpreted to have been triggered by eruptions and/or high rainfall events at the Volcano. Formations, and individual members within Formations, were dated by radiocarbon dating of organic material found below, within or above lahar deposits, or by coverbed stratigraphy. Both rhyolitic and andesitic tephras provided recognizable time planes in the late Quaternary coverbeds overlying lahar deposits. In this study quantitative analysis of quartz abundance, which is shown to vary between loesses and palaeosols, is used as an indirect means of establishing a surrogate for past climate changes which have been correlated to the deep sea oxygen isotope curve. A minimum age for the newly defined Whangaehu Formation is established by this method. The accumulation rate for lahars in the Whangaehu River has accelerated from 1 km3 every c. 23,000 years in the past c. 160,000 years to 1 km3 in 589 years in the past c. 2,000 years. This acceleration probably results from the increased frequency of lahars in the River following the development of Crater Lake c. 2,000 years B.P. According to this pattern an estimated 0.17 km3 volume of lahars could be anticipated over the next 100 years. If the 2,000 year accumulation rate were to be met over the next 100 years there would be 170 lahars of l0[superscript]6 m3 in this time interval , or 17 lahars of 10[superscript]7 m3 (or 1.7 lahars of 10[superscript]8 m3). The largest reported volume for an historic lahar is 10[superscript]6 m3 and these have occurred on average once every 30 years. The accumulation rate for historic lahars is 0.0054 km3 in 100 years. Therefore, although the accumulation rate appears to have slowed down, further large lahars with magnitudes 10 or 100 times greater than those witnessed could be expected.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laharic activity</field><field name="subject">Debris flows</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1382</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterization and possible biocontrol application of Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) isolated from NZ sources : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Muftikhar</field><field name="description">Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) are unique, predatory, endoparasitic, Gram-negative bacteria. As the world's smallest living hunter they prey on other Gram-negative bacteria giving them potential as biological control agents. Prior to this study, however, there were no reports of BD in New Zealand. The overall aim of this research was to isolate BD from New Zealand sources, characterise them and investigate their potential role as a biological control agent. The history, characteristics, life cycle and mechanism of predation of this organism are reviewed and the possibility of the industrial applications of BD, are discussed. In this study, a halophilic species of BD was isolated from fourteen coastal sea water sites around New Zealand. Thirteen isolates were characterised using proven characterisation techniques including general, microscopic and molecular techniques. It was found that the isolates were taxonomically identical or very closely related to each other and belong to the genus Bacteriovorax. The predation pattern of BD isolates was examined against a group of Gram negative bacteria in solid and liquid media. The predation patterns and efficiencies of the different BD isolates were similar, which confirms that the BD isolates are closely related, are selective in their predation, and prey on some Gram-negative bacteria but not all. The rapid loss of culture viability of BD is well known, but no studies have been reported to date on the survival of pure cultures of BD at different temperatures. The survival rate of BD in dense suspensions at different temperatures without host bacteria was investigated and it was observed that pure BD cultures can be stored with minimal reduction in numbers at temperatures ranging from 4&#176;C to 20&#176;C. However, significant reductions in numbers were observed at -1 8"C, 30&#176;C and 37&#176;C after 13 to 16 days. The effects of the 13 New Zealand BD isolates on the growth of a population of Photobacterium phosphoreum were examined to select the best isolate for in vitro application. All of the isolates tested had considerable reduction effect against P. phosphoreum. Some isolates were more effective than others, despite their taxonomic similarity to each other. The isolate OT2 was selected for further studies based on these results. The in vitro efficacy of BD was assessed against late exponential cultures of a seafood spoilage bacterium, P. phosphoreum, originally isolated from Cod fillets from Denmark. Loglo reductions of P. phosphoreum and some other Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 4.5 to 4.8 after 9 h of incubation at 25OC. BD was effective in reducing the numbers of P. phosphoreum at pH 5.5 to 8.5 and salinity 0.9 to 4.5% (wlv). A significant interaction was observed between the prey and predator concentrations and nutrient concentration. Prey concentrations were observed to be the most vital factor in predation and the most favourable predation conditions were at a prey concentration of -8 loglo colony forming units (CFU)/mL, together with a predator concentration of 3 - 7 loglo plaque forming units (PFU)/mL and a prey : predator ratio of &gt;5.0. The thresholds of the prey and predator concentrations for predation were observed to be 3.7 loglo CFUImL and 3.9 loglo PFUImL, respectively. The trials carried out in this study focused on the efficiency of BD on a pure culture of one organism, P. phosphoreum and not on mixed cultures of Gramnegative spoilage bacteria, the normal condition observed in saltwater fish. There has been very little research in this field and the results of these trials suggest further investigation into the effect of BD on mixed cultures of Gram-negative spoilage organisms is warranted. Since only one isolate of BD (OT2) was examined against only one spoilage bacterium (P. phosphoreum) in liquid medium, the evidence of these findings must be restricted to these particular conditions. Future studies, using a range of BD isolates against a mixture of spoilage and pathogenic organisms in solid medium are warranted. The biopreservation capability of BD in extending the shelf life of king salmon was evaluated. A significant effect was observed at 20&#176;C but not at 10&#176;C. At 20&#176;C the shelf life was extended through extension of the lag phase of growth of the prey bacteria and a reduction in total numbers attained. Sensory evaluation of the salmon product being tested confirmed that the shelf life was extended. However, at 10&#176;C there was no reduction in prey organisms, which suggested that the strain of BD used is ineffective at refrigeration temperatures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</field><field name="subject">Photobacterium phosphoreum</field><field name="subject">Fishery products</field><field name="subject">Biocontrol</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1392</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The response to and recovery from the 2004 Eastern Bay of Plenty flood event : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Emergency Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Busby, Eric</field><field name="description">Incident Management Systems used in New Zealand have their origins in the fire-fighting organisations of the United States of America in the 1970&#8217;s. They began in an atmosphere of disciplined quasi-military emergency response organizations. Emergency management research, theory and practice have since evolved to incorporate comprehensive facets acknowledging disasters are about people, individually and collectively and their environment. Emergency Management now includes addressing psycho-social aspects. New Zealand emergency services adopted the Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) as a result of a requirement following the Cave Creek disaster of 1995, where a multi- agency response to the event was found to be unsatisfactorily managed. Emergency management in the modern era now requires the orchestration of many and varied agencies and organisations including government and non-government organisations. These organisations are not necessarily suited to command type management styles and during a recovery phase of an incident, an approach involving a coordination style is more appropriate than a command style. An examination of the 2004 eastern Bay of Plenty flood event highlights that improved coordination by using a suitable incident management system benefits the response and recovery process. The Eastern Bay of Plenty community has social and cultural characteristics that impact on the effectiveness of emergency management outcomes. An incident management system that improves communication within the multi-agency organisation and between an emergency management organisation and the disaster-affected communities contributes to overall trauma reduction by stress reduction and facilitating early support and interventions. This allows where necessary, for modern emergency management to use systems that can utilise the unique community cultures, structures and networks that form the dynamic communities that they serve. If disasters magnify pre-existing social and community problems then the incident management system model used in a disaster can determine the degree of magnification.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Incident Management System</field><field name="subject">Disaster relief</field><field name="subject">Bay of Plenty, New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1524</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who are abusing our children? An exploratory study on reflections on child abuse by media commentators</field><field name="creator">Merchant, Raema</field><field name="description">This research explores what has been published in the print media on the topic of physical child abuse over an eight year period of time. The study encompasses news reports, feature articles, opinion columns and editorials written on the issue of physical child abuse in New Zealand from 2000 to 2007. Using inductive and exploratory research, qualitative data has been collected by capturing the voices from a range of media commentators and comparing these with data from newspaper articles and other sources of statistical data obtained from a statutory child protection agency, hospitals and police. The research looks at how physical child abuse is represented in the newspaper media and explores whether there are accuracies or deficiencies in this reporting that may impact on public perceptions of child abuse. In particular, the study explores whether what is being written in the newspaper is objective or whether there is an in-built ethnic or social bias in the reporting of child abuse. The findings of the three parts of the study are integrated and it is determined that there is a disproportionate reporting of child abuse based on a) the ethnicity of the child or perpetrator, b) the seriousness of the abuse, and c) the sensationalist nature of the incident of child abuse. Another significant finding is that media reflects and reinforces common views and perceptions of physical child abuse and that the public are exposed to only the &#8220;tip of the iceberg&#8221; in terms of accurate and balanced reporting. The report concludes with a discussion about whether the media affects or reflects the worldview of physical child abuse. A symbiotic model is proposed which uses voices from the writers themselves to support the argument that there is a bi-directional relationship between the media and the public.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physical child abuse</field><field name="subject">Newspaper media</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1612</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Persistent fatigue and endocrine function in women after radiotherapy for breast cancer.</field><field name="creator">Short, Michala</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Fatigue</field><field name="subject">Cortisol rhythm</field><field name="subject">Thyroid function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6446</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to International Terrorism: The Contribution of the United Nations</field><field name="creator">Emma Kennedy Da Silva</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">united nations, international terrorism, multilateralism, unilateralism, international relations, cooperation, institutions, security</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytogenetics and speciation in Drosophila tetrachaeta Angus.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Donald Scott.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Drosophila.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toxicology of compounds from the cyanobacterium cylindrospermopsis raciborskii</field><field name="creator">Norris, R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">730199 Clinical health not specific to particular organs, diseases and conditions</field><field name="subject">730210 Environmental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106319</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolated systolic hypertension and genes of the renin-angiotensin system</field><field name="creator">Davis, D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321004 Endocrinology</field><field name="subject">730105 Endocrine organs and diseases (incl. diabetes)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The neuromuscular responses to resistance training</field><field name="creator">Carroll, T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105635</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative stiffness and superelastic properties of orthodontic wires</field><field name="creator">Tan, E.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105743</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reliability of the corrected mesio-distal width of the unerupted teeth on rotational panoramic-radiographs</field><field name="creator">Manopatanakul, S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105746</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient cycling in tropical plantations and secondary rainforests</field><field name="creator">Langi, M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105846</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Distinction of Dreams: Dream-Life, Belief and Reform in Seventeenth-Century England</field><field name="creator">Riviere, J.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The introduction of the music of ethnic minority groups into Queensland State Schools</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Judith M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">9304 School/Institution</field><field name="subject">750306 Ethnicity and multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">School music -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186234</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of five rice varieties to zinc application on a Burdekin soil</field><field name="creator">Shwe, Nyunt</field><field name="description">The influence of genetic variability on the response of the five rice varieties, Cica, Starbonett, Lemont, Bluebonett X IR 43, and IR43, to applied zince at 0, 10, 20 and 40 kg Zn ha^-1 under varying cellulose and water management conditions was studied in a greenhouse experiment.

A quick maturing maize cultivar (DK529) and two cowpea cultivars (Red Caloona and 672330) were used. Changes in light availability to cowpea in intercrops were made by varying maize density. Three plant population densities were used: 22,000 plants ha^-1, 44,000 plants ha^-1, and 67,000 plants ha^-1. Both cowpea cultivars were very vegetative and vigorous in growth with little difference in their morphological characteristics. Cowpea cultivar 1 (Red Caloona) was however a better climber and retained green leaves for a longer duration. Increasing maize plant population density effectively reduced the amount of light reaching the cowpea canopy. Light availability was reduced to a minimum of 13% and 15% in the high maize plant population density and to a minimum of 47% and 42% in the low maize plant population density in cowpea cultivar 1 and 2 respectively. Intercropping reduced growth and yield of both cowpea cultivars through reductions in cowpea leaf area index (LAI), light interception and pod number. It also caused reductions in seed size in cowpea cultivar 2 (67233). Increasing maize plant population density further reduced all the above parameters. Maize growth and yield was affected by intercropping but to a lesser extent. Maize yields were reduced by 16% and 14% under cowpea cultivar 1 and cowpea cultivar 2 respectively, compared to an average reduction of 68% and 82% in cowpea cultivars 1 and 2 across the 3 maize plant population density. Radiation use efficiency (RUE) of the intercrops was lower than that of maize sole crop but higher than that of cowpea sole crop. Intercropping proved to be more advantageous in the vegetative stages of growth than in the reproductive stage except in the medium maize plant population density treatment. This was attributed to better light use efficiency in the early growth in intercrops than sole crops which was estimated to be between 1.1 and 2.9 time higher in intercrops than in sole maize in the first 20 days after sowing (DAMS) . Results indicated that LAI and leaf longevity had a large effect on radiation interception and use in cowpea. Cowpea cultivar 2 was better yielding in sole crop that cowpea cultivar 1 (954 Vs 621 Kgha^-1) but was more affected by intercrop (157 Vs Kgha^-1). An advantage of intercropping was only obtained in the medium maize plant population density intercrops. These were however small advantages (13% and 11%) in cowpea cultivar 2 and cultivar 1 respectively. Intercropping maize with these two cowpea cultivars would therefore be of advantage only, where the interest of the farmer is in the production of maize grain and cowpea leaf, wither for consumption, livestock feed or as green manure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corn -- Planting.</field><field name="subject">Cowpea.</field><field name="subject">Cowpea -- Planting.</field><field name="subject">Intercropping.</field><field name="subject">Corn.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209763</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International negotiation styles: A perspective of Malaysian diplomats</field><field name="creator">Mohd Hashim, Hishamuddin</field><field name="description">Negotiation competency is an important focus of all countries as negotiation is a core event in international relations and diplomacy. Malaysia is no exception. Existing literature indicates that there has never been any research to study the Malaysian practice in international negotiations. As far as diplomatic negotiation is concerned, there is also a dearth of literature on what is going on at the negotiation table due to its secretive nature. Most of the research conducted on negotiation has originated from Western concepts of negotiation, and there is a lack of research concerning non-Western and specifically Malaysian notions of negotiation. A number of studies have been carried out to identify negotiation styles of some countries in Asia, and research on Malaysian negotiation is merely a descriptive explanation of Malaysians&#8217; business negotiation behaviour. Furthermore, there is a growing need of research that employs varieties of methods in studying negotiation as most of the overseas studies were quantitative in nature. Thus, researching into the Malaysian practice of international negotiation will help to close the gaps in the literature because: (1) it will address the lack of research on Malaysian negotiating styles from the viewpoint of the public sector, as opposed to the business sector; (2) it will extend the work on non-Western perspectives on diplomatic negotiation by injecting Malaysian notions of international negotiation, as seen by Malaysians; (3) it will enrich the current literature on negotiating styles of countries in Asia; (4) it will add to the small amount of international scholarship on diplomatic negotiation and (5) this research will employ a mixed-method approach, and this will complement the need to employ varieties of research methods in negotiation research. The main aim of this research is to explore and highlight the key features of Malaysian negotiating practice in international negotiations from the perspectives and experiences of Malaysian diplomats. This research adopted a mixed-methods approach. An interpretive approach with some elements of phenomenology, symbolic interactionism and systems theory was the main paradigm adopted for the qualitative study while a questionnaire survey was employed for the quantitative study. Key-informant interviews with 22 former diplomats were conducted and a survey of 39 respondents amongst in-service Malaysian diplomats was successfully carried out. The research contributes to understanding of Malaysian negotiating practice in international negotiations and generates important insights for diplomatic training providers in setting-up relevant training modules. It also helps negotiators from different nations to comprehend the negotiation practice of Malaysia and helps to eliminate stereotyping and biases. In addition, since international negotiation is a universal phenomenon, the findings of this study are not only applicable to Malaysia but to other nations as well. Important key and relevant points that could contribute to international negotiation knowledge were identified and discussed. Finally, based on the research, policy recommendations were proposed to enhance negotiation competency in any international negotiation, and future research was identified and suggested for the benefit of international negotiation knowledge and scholarship.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">International negotiation</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Diplomats</field><field name="subject">Negotiation styles</field><field name="subject">Mixed-methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/993</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double Star</field><field name="creator">Thornton, Bernard Christopher Buchanan</field><field name="description">The work is situated in a literary and theoretical context by working with the concepts of authenticity and realism, and within that the story/world distinction.

Real soil profiles are often multi-layered with material constantly varying with depth, which affects the footing response significantly. Furthermore, the properties of the soil are known to vary with location. The spatial variability of soil can be described by random field theory and geostatistics. The research presented in this thesis focuses on quantifying the effect of soil variability on the bearing capacity of rough strip footings on single and two layered, purely-cohesive, spatially variable soil profiles. This has been achieved by using Monte Carlo analysis, where the rough strip footings are founded on simulated soil profiles are analysed using finite element limit analysis. The simulations of virtual soil profiles are carried out using Local Average Subdivision (LAS), a numerical model based on the random field theory. An extensive parametric study has been carried out and the results of the analyses are presented as normalized means and coefficients of variation of bearing capacity factor, and comparisons between different cases are presented. The results indicate that, in general, the mean of the bearing capacity reduces as soil variability increases and the worst case scenario occurs when the correlation length is in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 times the footing width. The problem of estimating the bearing capacity of shallow strip footings founded on multi-layered soil profiles is very complex, due to the incomplete knowledge of interactions and relationships between parameters. Much research has been carried out on single- and two-layered homogeneous soil profiles. At present, the inaccurate weighted average method is the only technique available for estimating the bearing capacity of footing on soils with three or more layers. In this research, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to develop meta-models for bearing capacity estimation. ANNs are numerical modelling techniques that imitate the human brain capability to learn from experience. This research is limited to shallow strip footing founded on soil mass consisting of ten layers, which are weightless, purely cohesive and cohesive-frictional. A large number of data has been obtained by using finite element limit analysis. These data are used to train and verify the ANN models. The shear strength (cohesion and friction angle), soil thickness, and footing width are used as model inputs, as they are influencing factors of bearing capacity of footings. The model outputs are the bearing capacities of the footings. The developed ANN-based models are then compared with the weighted average method. Hand-calculation design formulae for estimation of bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered soil profiles, based on the ANN models, are presented. It is shown that the ANN-based models have the ability to predict the bearing capacity of footings on ten-layered soil profiles with a high degree of accuracy, and outperform traditional methods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil variability; Bearnig capacity; Artificial neural network</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics.</field><field name="subject">Foundations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52447</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A life course approach to measuring socioeconomic position in population surveillance and its role in determining health status.</field><field name="creator">Chittleborough, Catherine R.</field><field name="description">Measuring socioeconomic position (SEP) in population chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems is essential for monitoring changes in socioeconomic inequities in health over time. A life course approach in epidemiology considers the long-term effects of physical and social exposures during gestation, childhood, adolescence, and later adult life on health. Previous studies provide evidence that socioeconomic factors at different stages of the life course influence current health status. Measures of SEP during early life to supplement existing indicators of current SEP are required to more adequately explain the contribution of socioeconomic factors to health status and monitor health inequities. The aim of this thesis was to examine how a life course perspective could enhance the monitoring of SEP in chronic disease and risk factor surveillance systems. The thesis reviewed indicators of early life SEP used in previous research, determined indicators of early life SEP that may be useful in South Australian surveillance systems, and examined the association of SEP over the life course and self-rated health in adulthood across different population groups to demonstrate that inclusion of indicators of early life SEP in surveillance systems could allow health inequities to be monitored among socially mobile and stable groups. A variety of indicators, such as parents&#8217; education level and occupation, and financial circumstances and living conditions during childhood, have been used in different study designs in many countries. Indicators of early life SEP used to monitor trends in the health and SEP of populations over time, and to analyse long-term effects of policies on the changing health of populations, need to be feasible to measure retrospectively, and relevant to the historical, geographical and sociocultural context in which the surveillance system is operating. Retrospective recall of various indicators of early life SEP was examined in a telephone survey of a representative South Australian sample of adults. The highest proportions of missing data were observed for maternal grandfather&#8217;s occupation, and mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s highest education level. Family structure, housing tenure, and family financial situation when the respondent was aged ten, and mother and father&#8217;s main occupation had lower item non-response. Respondents with missing data on early life SEP indicators were disadvantaged in terms of current SEP compared to those who provided this information. The differential response to early life SEP questions according to current circumstances has implications for chronic disease surveillance examining the life course impact of socioeconomic disadvantage. While face-to-face surveys are considered the gold standard of interviewing techniques, computer-assisted telephone interviewing is often preferred for cost and convenience. Recall of father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s highest education level in the telephone survey was compared to that obtained in a face-to-face interview survey. The proportion of respondents who provided information about their father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s highest education level was significantly higher in the face-to-face interview than in the telephone interview. Survey mode, however, did not influence the finding that respondents with missing data for parents&#8217; education were more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged. Alternative indicators of early life SEP, such as material and financial circumstances, are likely to be more appropriate than parents&#8217; education for life course analyses of health inequities using surveillance data. Questions about family financial situation and housing tenure during childhood and adulthood asked in the cross-sectional telephone survey were used to examine the association of SEP over the life course with self-rated health in adulthood. Disadvantaged SEP during both childhood and adulthood and upward social mobility in financial situation were associated with a reduced prevalence of excellent or very good health, although this relationship varied across gender, rurality, and country of birth groups. Trend data from a chronic disease and risk factor surveillance system indicated that socioeconomic disadvantage in adulthood was associated with poorer self-rated health. The surveillance system, however, does not currently contain any measures of early life SEP. Overlaying the social mobility variables on the surveillance data indicated how inequities in health could be differentiated in greater detail if early life SEP was measured in addition to current SEP. Inclusion of life course SEP measures in surveillance will enable monitoring of health inequities trends among socially mobile and stable groups. Life course measures are an innovative way to supplement other SEP indicators in surveillance systems. Considerable information can be gained with the addition of a few questions. This will provide further insight into the determinants of health and illness and enable improved monitoring of the effects of policies and interventions on health inequities and intergenerational disadvantage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surveillance; Life course epidemiology; Self-rated health; Socioeconomic position; Population survey; Health inequities</field><field name="subject">Health surveys South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Health status indicators South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Social status Health aspects South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Public health Social aspects South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53358</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weed resistance risk management in glyphosate-resistant cotton</field><field name="creator">Werth, Jeff Alan</field><field name="description">The introduction of glyphosate resistance into Australian cotton systems will have an effect on conventional weed management practices, the weed species present and the risk of glyphosate resistance evolving in weed species. Therefore, it is important that the effects of these management practices, particularly a potential reduction in Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices, be examined to determine their impact on weed population dynamics and resistance selection. The study began in 2003 with a survey of 40 growers in four major cotton growing regions in Australia to gain an understanding of how adoption of glyphosate resistance had influenced the weed spectrum, weed management practices and herbicide use after three years of glyphosate-resistant cotton being available. The 10 most common weeds reported on cotton fields were the same in glyphosate-resistant and conventional fields. In this survey, herbicide use patterns were altered by the adoption of glyphosate-resistant cotton with up to six times more glyphosate being applied and with 21% fewer growers applying pre-emergence herbicides in glyphosate-resistant cotton fields. Other weed control practices, such as the use of post-emergence herbicides, inter-row cultivation and hand hoeing, were only reduced marginally. A systems experiment was conducted to determine differences in the population dynamics of Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) and Urochloa panicoides (liverseed grass) under a range of weed management regimes in a glyphosate-resistant cotton system. These treatments ranged from a full IWM system to a system based soley on the use of glyphosate. The experiment investigated the effect of the treatments on the soil seed bank, weed germination patterns and weed numbers in the field. All applied treatments resulted in commercially acceptable control of the two grass weeds. However, the treatments containing soil-applied residual herbicides proved to be more effective over the period of the experiment. The treatment with a reduced residual herbicide program supplemented with glyphosate had a level of control similar to the full IWM treatments with less input, providing a more economical option. The effectiveness of these treatments in the long-term was examined in a simulation model to determine the likelihood of glyphosate resistance evolving using barnyardgrass and liverseed grass as model weeds. Seed production and above-ground biomass of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass in competition with cotton were measured. In all experiments, seed production and biomass plant&#8315;&#185;  decreased as weed density increased while seed production and biomass m&#8315;&#185; tended to increase. Seed production m&#8315;&#185; reached 40,000 and 60,000 for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. In 2004-05, weeds were also planted 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the cotton was planted. Biomass and seed production of the two weeds planted 6 weeks after cotton were significantly reduced with seed production declining to 12,000 and 2,500 seeds m&#8315;&#185; row for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. Weeds planted 12 weeks after cotton planting failed to emerge. This experiment highlighted the importance of early season weed control and effective management of weeds that are able to produce high seed numbers. A glyphosate dose-mortality experiment was conducted in the field to determine levels of control of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass. Glyphosate provided effective control of both species with over 85% control when the rate applied was greater than 690 g ae ha&#8315;&#185;. Dose-mortality curves for both species were obtained for use in the glyphosate resistance model. Data from the experimental work were combined to develop a glyphosate resistance model. Outputs from this model suggest that if glyphosate were used as the only form of weed control, resistance in weeds is likely to eventuate after 12 to 17 years, depending on the characteristics of the weed species, initial resistance gene frequencies and any associated fitness penalties. If glyphosate was used in conjunction with one other weed control method, resistance was delayed but not prevented. The simulations suggested that when a combination of weed control options was employed in addition to glyphosate, resistance would not evolve over the 30-year period of the simulation. These simulations underline the importance of an integrated strategy in weed management to prevent glyphosate resistance evolving from the use of glyphosate-resistant cotton. Current management conditions of growing glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready &amp;reg) cotton should therefore prevent glyphosate resistance evolution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cotton, weeds--control, herbicides, herbicide resistance, glyphosate</field><field name="subject">Weeds Control</field><field name="subject">Cotton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Penicillium radicum: studies on the mechanisms of growth promotion in wheat.</field><field name="creator">Anstis, Simon</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were to investigate the P solubilising activity of Penicillium radicum and identify other possible mechanisms of plant growth promotion that were not related to P solubilisation. The plant chosen for the studies was wheat, the largest cereal commodity produced by Australian agriculture. Given the large area that is planted annually to wheat, this crop represents a large potential market for P. radicum-based inoculants. However, it is unlikely that P. radicum will be effective in all wheat growing regions and all environmental conditions seen in these areas. Research on the modes of action may help to identify the conditions where P. radicum has a good chance of being effective. The P solubilising activity of P. radicum was assessed by examining the amount of P released from rock phosphate (RP) in-vitro. The effectiveness of P. radicum to solubilise RP was compared to that of another P solubilising fungus, the isolate P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1. Both fungi were cultured in a liquid medium that contained either NO&#8323;&#8315; or NH &#8324;&#8314; as the sole source of N. Changes in culture pH, soluble P and gluconic acid concentration were determined for both fungi in a 168 hour incubation in both buffered (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8) and non-buffered medium. For P. radicum, the maximum concentration of soluble P was 6.8 fold higher in the presence of NH&#8324;&#8314; compared to NO&#8323;&#8315;. In contrast, for P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 the highest concentration of soluble P measured in the fungal culture was not significantly affected by N-source. In buffered medium, P. radicum did not appear to solubilise RP and levels of soluble P were generally &lt;1 mg L&#8315;&#185;. In contrast, the RP solubilising activity of P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 was not affected by buffering. Increased RP solubilisation with NH&#8324;&#8314; as the N source and lack of RP solubilisation in buffered medium suggested that acidification was the main mechanism of P solubilisation by P. radicum. RP solubilisation by P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 was similar over the range of culture conditions tested and mechanisms of RP solubilisation are likely to be a combination of mechanisms that relate to both acidification and the production of organic anions. The effect of inoculation with P. radicum on plant growth and P nutrition was studied under glasshouse conditions using a sand culture assay that supplied defined sources of P. The plant growth and P response to P. radicum inoculation were determined in two separate experiments. In Experiment 1, plants were grown to pre-heading stage and supplied with either dibasic calcium phosphate (Ca-P), crystalline iron phosphate (Fe-P), rock phosphate (RP) or phytate (P&#8338;) as the source of P. In Experiment 2, plants were harvested after 8 weeks and supplied with either NO&#8323;&#8315; or NH&#8324;&#8314; as the sole source of N and the P sources were either Ca-P or RP. In Experiment 1, the plant P response (defined as higher shoot P concentration and P uptake) to inoculation was dependent on the P source. The greatest plant P response to inoculation was observed for Ca-P and no significant P response was measured in plants that were supplied with Fe-P, RP or P&#8338;. In pots that supplied Fe-P as the P source, there was an increase in shoot dry matter in response to P. radicum inoculation but this occurred without a concomitant plant P response. In Experiment 2, the plant P response to inoculation was dependent on the N source. In the presence of NH&#8324;&#8314;, P. radicum significantly increased the availability of P sources RP and Ca-P. While there was no significant plant P response under NO&#8323;&#8315; supply, there was a significant increase in dry matter production due to P. radicum inoculation. When the data of Experiments 1 &amp; 2 are taken together, results suggest that P. radicum possesses at least two mechanisms of plant growth promotion, (1) P solubilisation and (2) general growth promotion that is independent of P solubilisation. In agreement with P solubilisation in solution cultures, the P solubilisation mechanism of P. radicum in sand culture required NH&#8324;&#8314;. The ability of P. radicum to increase plant growth independently of a plant P response gave further evidence of general growth promoting abilities of the fungus. While sand culture is a useful tool to elucidate the fungal mechanisms of plant growth promotion, this approach cannot fully reflect the complexity of the rhizosphere in non-sterile soil. Hence, a subsequent experiment was done to determine the effect of P. radicum on plant growth and P nutrition in a number of field soils. The P solubilising activity of P. radicum was determined in four Australian field soils using isotopic dilution. Three soils were chosen on the basis of their chemistry of P retention: (1) Minnipa soil from South Australia was chosen due to P retention associated with the highly alkaline calcareous nature of this soil; (2) Innisfail Queensland, in this soil P retention was dominated by reaction with Fe oxides; and (3) Mt Schank South Australia, a volcanic soil where P retention was predominantly associated with Al oxides. The fourth soil, from Mingenew Western Australia, was chosen due to previous reports that P. radicum inoculation increased the yield of field grown wheat (Bio-Care Technology, unpublished data). The four field soils were each labelled with KH&#8322; &#179;&#178;PO&#8324;  and the specific activity (&#179;&#178;P) of the wheat seedling tissue was measured after four weeks growth. When the data was averaged across all four soil types, inoculation with P. radicum caused a significant 11.7% increase in the shoot dry weight of these seedlings. However, P. radicum did not cause any consistent significant difference in the specific activity (&#179;&#178;P) of plants when compared to uninoculated control plants. These results suggested that P. radicum did not have a strong ability to solubilise P from the test soils, and mechanisms other than P solubilisation were in operation to stimulate plant growth. The production of plant growth regulators (PGR) was considered as a mechanism of plant growth promotion not related to P solubilisation. To further explore the hypothesis that the production of PGR acts as a mechanism of plant growth promotion, the ability of P. radicum to produce the auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was investigated. Examination with thin-layer chromatography and the Avena coleoptile straight growth assay indicated that fractions of P. radicum culture medium with chemical characteristics similar to IAA (i.e. similar reaction to the Salkowski reagent and Rf as IAA) also possessed auxin-like activity. Using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) it was found that in liquid culture amended with the precursor tryptophan, P. radicum produced IAA at concentrations up to 0.406 &#181;M. These studies show that P. radicum can produce IAA under laboratory culture conditions. To determine the significance of IAA as a mechanism of plant growth promotion, further studies need to link effects on plant growth and development to the production of IAA by P. radicum. The ability of P. radicum to antagonise root pathogens and control root disease was considered as a further mechanism of growth promotion. Under in-vitro conditions, P. radicum produced hyphal growth patterns and enzymes (protease, &#946;-1,3- and &#946;-1,4-glucanase activity) that were indicative of hyperparasitism. Hyperparasitic growth was seen as hyphal coiling and branching of P. radicum against host hyphae of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium pseudograminearum and Pythium irregulare when these soilborne pathogens were studied in dual culture with P. radicum. The effect of P. radicum on the fungal root disease severity of take-all was studied using a seedling bioassay under glasshouse conditions. The ability of P. radicum to suppress take-all disease appeared to be related to the timing of P. radicum infection of wheat seedling roots and placement of the Ggt inoculum in relation to the roots. Compared to soils where Ggt inoculum was only distributed at distances &gt;1 cm below the seed, uniform mixing of the Ggt inoculum throughout the soil negated the beneficial effect of P. radicum on plant growth and its ability to reduce take-all root lesion size. Conversely, early infection of wheat roots by P. radicum gave wheat seedlings some protection against take-all disease. Where treatment with P. radicum was effective, increasing the inoculum dose significantly reduced take-all lesion size. While P. radicum exhibited antagonism towards F. pseudograminearum, Py. irregulare, Bipolaris sorokiniana and R. solani cereal root pathogens in-vitro, further studies under non-sterile soil conditions are needed to evaluate the potential for P. radicum to reduce root disease caused by these fungi. In conclusion, it is unlikely that one single mechanism explains the beneficial effect of P. radicum on wheat growth. In-vitro studies showed that P. radicum has a number of attributes that could function as mechanisms of plant growth promotion. These attributes were, (1) P solubilisation, (2) production of IAA and (3) the ability to antagonise soilborne pathogens in-vitro and reduce the lesion size of the take-all disease in a seedling bioassay. Sand culture assays revealed that at least two plant growth mechanisms were in operation, (1) P solubilisation and (2) a general growth promotion mechanism that was independent of P solubilisation. In agreement with Whitelaw et al. (1999), the P solubilisation mechanism of P. radicum operates via an acidification mechanism. The effectiveness of this mechanism may be limited by the availability of NH&#8324;&#8314; in the rhizosphere. Since NH&#8324;&#8314; appears to be required for P solubilisation there may exist an interaction between P. radicum and ammoniacal fertilisers. This will have implications for its effectiveness in the field. In-vitro studies suggest that the general mechanism of growth promotion may be related to the production of PGRs such as IAA. In this aspect the known colonisation of the interior of wheat roots by P. radicum would ensure that IAA produced by the fungus is taken up by the root cell and less subject to chemical degradation and/or degradation by other soil microorganisms. Further studies are required to identify the effect of IAA production on plant growth and the effect of P. radicum inoculation on root disease severity in non-sterile soil.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat Growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59078</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the issues of language contact and language shift in Tok Pisin - focusing on two "non-standard" varieties: highlands pidgin and anglicised pidgin.</field><field name="creator">Wakizaka, Miwako</field><field name="description">Tok Pisin is the most prevailing common language in Papua New Guinea. It was originally an English lexifier pidgin language and has developed as the virtual universal lingua franca in this multilingual country where over 850 indigenous languages are spoken today (Nekitel 1998). The term Tok Pisin covers a large number of varieties due to the various social and linguistic backgrounds of its speakers. Traditionally, the rural varieties which are spoken in Coastal and Island areas are regarded as mainstream Tok Pisin and previous studies have mainly focused on these varieties. However, since the social and linguistic situation in the country has continuously changed and the language contact between Tok Pisin and both substratum languages and the superstratum language, English, continues, the varieties which were regarded as &#8220;non-standard&#8221; seem to play an important role, especially in the context of language contact and language shift today. Therefore, with respect to the roles that &#8220;non-standard&#8221; varieties play and their features, many gaps still remain. Most studies have focused on standard varieties. In order to fill in the gaps, this study will address the issues of language contact and language shift in Tok Pisin, mainly focusing on two &#8220;nonstandard&#8221; varieties. One is Highlands Pidgin which is spoken mainly in the Highlands area of the country. Because of the increase of emigrant population from Highlands to other regions, it seems that Highlands Pidgin impacts on other regional varieties of Tok Pisin. First, the characteristics which have been considered to be Highlands features are reconsidered by reanalysing previous studies and examining the author&#8217;s primary data. Then the role that Highlands Pidgin plays in the current language situation in Papua New Guinea is discussed. The other &#8220;non-standard&#8221; variety considered here is the anglicised variety. It has been pointed out that Tok Pisin is currently undergoing &#8220;decreolisation&#8221;, that is, it is gradually losing its own features and assimilating to English. However, the degree of the anglicisation can very with situations, speakers and topics and, although earlier studies provide many important findings, few recent studies have been undertaken. Thus, the degree of anglicisation is examined according to each linguistic component including phonology, morphology, lexicon and syntax based on primary data. As one of the parameters of anglicisation, code switching between Tok Pisin and English is also examined using the Matrix Language-Frame model proposed by Myers-Scotton (1993). Following the analysis of the two varieties, some sociolinguistic considerations are provided in order to capture the situation in which language contact and language shift take place. In conclusion, based on the author&#8217;s observations and analysis, this study proposes the argument that there is little reason to rule out the &#8220;non-standard&#8221; varieties and that Tok Pisin has been a language completely distinct from English, which supports Smith&#8217;s (2002) viewpoint. Also, it illustrates a description of current Tok Pisin which coexists with English. Whether the situation continues or not in the future is open to question; however, the structural features of Tok Pisin and its remarkable vitality which are revealed here can inform the study of language contact, language shift and language maintenance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tok Pisin; Highlands pidgin; Anglicised pidgin; language contact; language shift; standardisation; Anglicisation; decreolisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60069</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of limited site investigations on the design and performance of pile foundations.</field><field name="creator">Arsyad, Ardy</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis focuses on the quantification of the effect of limited site investigations on the design and performance of pile foundations. Limited site investigation is one of the main causes of structural foundation failures. Over the last 30 years, most site investigations conducted for infrastructure projects have been dictated by minimum cost and time of completion, rather than meeting the need to appropriately characterise soil properties (Institution of Civil Engineers 1991; Jaksa et al. 2003). As a result, limited site investigations remain common, resulting in a higher risk of structural foundation failure, unforeseen additional construction, and/or repair costs. Also, limited site investigations can result in over-designing foundations, leading to increased and unnecessary cost (ASFE 1996). Based on the reliability examination method for site investigations introduced by Jaksa et al. (2003) and performed by Goldsworthy (2006), this research investigated the effect of limited site investigations on the design of pile foundations. This was achieved by generating three-dimensional random fields to obtain a virtual site consisting of soil properties at certain levels of variability, and by simulating various numbers of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and pile foundations on the generated site. Once the site and the CPTs were simulated, the cone tip resistance (qc) was profiled along the vertical and horizontal axes. The simulated qc profiles yielded by the CPTs were then used to compute axial pile load capacity termed the pile foundation design based on site investigations (SI). In parallel, the axial pile load capacity of the simulated pile foundation utilising the &#8220;true&#8221; cone tip resistance along the simulated pile was also determined. This is termed &#8220;the true&#8221; design, or the benchmark pile foundation design, and referred to as pile foundation design based on complete knowledge (CK). At the end of this process, the research compared the pile foundation designs based on SI and those based on CK. The reliability of the foundation design based on SI was analysed with a probabilistic approach, using the Monte Carlo technique. The results indicated that limited site investigations have a significant impact on the design of pile foundations. The results showed that minimum sampling efforts result in a high risk of over- or under-designing piles. More intensive sampling efforts, in contrast, led to a low risk of under- or over-design. The results also indicated that the levels of spatial variability of the soil are notable factors that affect the effectiveness of site investigations. These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a site investigation in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">site investigation; pile foundation; reliability; design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60070</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructor attention to oral reading errors: a functional analysis</field><field name="creator">McNaughton, Stuart, 1950</field><field name="description">The effect of attention to oral reading errors has received little specific examination by researchers in applied behaviour analysis. Some data suggest attending to such errors can have inappropriate effects on learning. A conceptual framework was developed to examine the effects of error attention on the acquisition of proficient reading responses. Analyses of reading behaviour employed concepts and data from 'structural' accounts of reading. These concepts provided details of the components of response systems. Acquisition of proficient reading was seen to involve trends towards accurate integrated responding which becomes self controlled. Error attention was conceptualised as having motivational and informational properties which could directly affect acquisition trends. The first experiment (Chapter Three) demonstrated that under appropriate conditions oral reading behaviour was facilitated by error attention. Eleven year old readers in a Learning Disabilities classroom were measured in their usual reading setting. Two readers received extra tutoring with error attention procedures. A further two readers acted as a contrast for the effects of increased opportunities to respond. These readers received extra practice tutoring with minimum levels of praise. A third subject received no extra tutoring during the course of the experiment. Results indicated that both practice and error attention produced substantial increases in accuracy and correct rates. Accuracy levels were higher for error attention subjects suggesting error attention can have important learning outcomes. Additionally, predictions concerning the error attention dimensions of modeling and prompting were tested. Prompts were found to be more effective with the more proficient reader while models were more effective with the less proficient reader. The second experiment (Chapter Four) examined specific predictions about timing of error attention. Six, 6 year old normal readers received daily sessions of either delayed or immediate attention to errors. Every second day the subjects also read a text on which they were not tutored. Results showed that delayed attention increased the percent of errors self corrected for five subjects in both the tutored and non tutored texts. Increases in self corrections were consistently associated with increased accuracy. The data supported both the predictions and the proposed model of self correction behaviour as having a tutorial or self instruction function. Both experiments were discussed in terms of the functions of error attention in facilitating acquisition of proficient reading. Methodological issues in the behaviour analysis of oral reading were also discussed and implications from the studies for instruction in learning to read are drawn. The usefulness of concepts from 'structural' accounts of reading for a predictive 'functional' account of error attention is examined in a concluding section.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who is the Change Manager?</field><field name="creator">Hassner Nahmias, Anat</field><field name="description">This research study looks at the &#8216;who&#8217;, i.e., who manages organisational change projects and what competencies they need to manage them effectively.

Prior to this research, little information was available on its reproductive behaviour. Emergence of A. ervi peaks during the first few hours of the photophase with males being protandrous. Females become sexually mature earlier than males and oviposit primarily in the photophase. Aphids parasitised in their early instars die before reproduction but those parasitised in later instars produce a limited number of progeny. Females prefer aphids of 3- to 5-d-old over the younger and older aphids for oviposition. Females ovipositing in 4- to 7-d-old aphids have more fitness gains in terms of progeny body size and egg load at emergence. Fertilised eggs are more likely deposited in large hosts and unfertilised eggs in small ones. Large individuals have greater longevity, large males father more progeny, and large females have higher fecundity, parasitism and greater ability in host searching. However, with increasing body size females gain more than males in longevity and fecundity but males gain more than females in the number of female progeny. Males can inseminate up to nine females and they carry about 82% effective sperm at emergence and replenish about 18% sperm during their adult life. Females adjust the oviposition and sex allocation strategies in response to increasing host density with higher number of aphids parasitised at higher host densities and lower proportion of female progeny produced at lower host densities. Males play an active role in mating behaviour. Males having mating experience, and being large or younger, respond to females more quickly and perform better courtships resulting in higher mating success. Males prefer larger and younger females for mating probably because the latter have greater reproductive potential. Males optimize the use of their sperm based on the availability of their sperm and the reproductive status (age) of females. The switchingoff of female receptivity of male mating attempt after the mating is a gradual process. Some females accept the second males within 1 minute since the termination of the first mating. The shorter mating period in the second mating suggests that females remate probably due to the gradual process of switching-off of female receptivity rather than the insufficient sperm transformation during the first mating. Males prolong their mating duration in male-biased operational sex ratio to reduce the probability of female remating.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aphids</field><field name="subject">Reproduction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/749</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and reality : the teaching of oral communication by Japanese teachers of English in public junior high schools in Kurashiki City, Japan : a thesis presented in the fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Second Language Teaching at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rapley, Douglas James</field><field name="description">In 2003 the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) unveiled their new junior high school (JHS) English as a Foreign Language (EFL) policy, which focused strongly on oral communication. Although there is evidence of policy noncompliance in schools until now there has been no English language research on the attitudes or practices of Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), or the views of the students, and their parents in regards to teaching/learning English speaking skills. The research, based on JHSs in a mid-sized Japanese city (pop. 475,000 approx.), focused predominantly on JTEs, but also included students, and their parents. Focus group sessions, questionnaires, and one-on-one interviews were used to collect data. The study reveals that learning English speaking skills is considered important, but passing the senior high school (SHS) entrance examination is the main concern and so, test impact from the SHS entrance examination exerts the greatest pressure on JHS JTEs. The JTEs also perceive themselves as facing other issues such as student motivation, JTE speaking proficiency, and large class sizes. Another finding is that JTEs appear to receive inadequate training&#8211; pre- and inservice&#8211; resulting in issues, such as a reliance on traditional methods (yakudoku), which are not in accordance with MEXT&#8217;s intentions, and JTE proficiency test achievement levels lower than those desired by MEXT. As a result of these issues gaps exist between MEXT JHS EFL policies and actual teaching practices, and have unfortunately led to a situation where JTEs believe that MEXT does not care about or understand the teaching environment. The study concludes that implementation of MEXT&#8217;s policy require a better match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy, a decrease in class sizes, and JTEs receiving more adequate training. A more positive relationship between MEXT and JTEs would result from these two groups working collaboratively when designing JHS EFL policies and could better achieve a match between the SHS entrance examination and JHS EFL policy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language teaching</field><field name="subject">spoken English</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">speaking English</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organicism, motivic parallelism, and performance in Beethoven's piano sonata Op. 2 No. 3 : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master  of Music in Musicology</field><field name="creator">Robb, Hamish James Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis summarises the important ideologies and concepts of musical organicism in the late eighteenth century and applies them to motivic analysis and performance. Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">K&#257;ore te aroha-- : te hua o te w&#257;nanga : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Black, Taiarahia</field><field name="description">Te Ora &#274; noho an&#257; n&#333; i te koko ko &#332;hiwa, kia whakarongo rua, Aku taringa ki te Tai o tuar&#257; e o Kanawa, E &#257;ki ana mai ki uta r o &#332;hakana.

The research began with an examination of the whole design cycle, with a view to identifying requirements for implementing image processing on FPGAs. Based on this analysis, a design process was developed where a selected software algorithm is matched to a hardware architecture tailor made for its implementation. The algorithm and architecture are then transformed into an FPGA suitable design. It was found that in most cases the most efficient mapping for image processing algorithms is to use a streamed processing approach. This constrains how data is presented and requires most existing algorithms to be extensively modified. Therefore, the resultant designs are heavily streamed and pipelined. A visual notation was developed to complement this design process, as both streaming and pipelining can be well represented by data flow visual languages. The notation has three views each of which represents and supports a different part of the design process. An architecture view gives an overview of the design's main blocks and their interconnections. A computational view represents lower-level details by representing each block by a set of computational expressions and low-level controls. This includes a novel visual representation of pipelining that simplifies latency analysis, multiphase design, priming, flushing and stalling, and the detection of sequencing errors. A scheduling view adds a state machine for high-level control of processing blocks. This extended state objects to allow for the priming and flushing of pipelined operations. User evaluations of an implementation of the key parts of this language (the architecture view and the computational view) found that both were generally good visualisations and aided in design (especially the type interface, pipeline and control notations). The user evaluations provided several suggestions for the improvement of the language, and in particular the evaluators would have preferred to use the diagrams as a verification tool for a textual representation rather than as the primary data capture mechanism. A cognitive dimensions analysis showed that the language scores highly for thirteen of the twenty dimensions considered, particularly those related to making details of the design clearer to the developer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual programming language</field><field name="subject">field programmable gate arrays</field><field name="subject">human computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280303 Programming languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1219</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A transformational model to understand the impact of enterprise systems for business benefits : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Technology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mathrani, Sanjay</field><field name="description">Over the years many organizations have implemented an enterprise system (ES), also called enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, to streamline the flow of information and improve organizational effectiveness to produce business benefits which justify the ES investment. The effectiveness of these systems to achieve benefits is an area being proactively researched by both professionals and academia. However, most of these studies focus on &#8216;what ESs do&#8217; rather than &#8216;how ESs do it&#8217;. The purpose of this study is to better understand how organizations derive benefits from utilization of an ES and its data. This study utilizes a transformational model of how ES data are transformed into knowledge and results to evaluate the impact of ES information on organizational functions and processes and how this can lead to business benefits. The linkage between expected outcomes, utilization of ES data in decision-making processes, and realized or unrealized benefits provides the reason for this study. Findings reveal that the key benefits commercial firms seek from an ES include improving information flow and visibility, integration and automation of functions, cost reductions by reducing inventory, and achieving process efficiencies for both internal and external operations. The various tools and methods businesses use for transforming ES data into knowledge include the use of data warehouses and business intelligence modules that assist in extraction and manipulation of data, and reporting on particular data objects. Web portals are actively utilized to collaborate between stakeholders and access real-time information. Business tools such as KPI reporting, balanced scorecards and dashboards are used to track progress towards realizing benefits and establishing analytical decision making. Findings emphasize that benefit realization from an ES implementation is a holistic process that not only includes the essential data and technology factors, but also includes other factors such as business strategy deployment, people and process management, and skills and competency development. Findings reveal that business organizations generally lack in producing value assessments that often lead to weak business cases and insufficient benefit models which cannot be used for benefit tracking. However, these organizations are now realizing that it is not enough to put in an ES and expect an automatic improvement. Organizations are now establishing analytical and knowledge-leveraging processes to optimize and realize business value from their ES investment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enterprise system</field><field name="subject">Enterprise resource planning system</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Organisational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1368</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late quaternary lahars from Mount Ruapehu in the Whangaehu River, North Island, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosoophy in Soil Science at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Katherine Anne</field><field name="description">The stratigraphic record of lahars in the Whangaehu River reveals that in the past 180,000 years this route has been one of the main conduits for lahars from Mount Ruapehu, the highest active andesitic stratovolcano in the Central North Island of New Zealand. Both debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows have engulfed surfaces up to 160 km distance from the Volcano. Eight episodes of laharic activity are recognized by the distinctive lithology and similar age of their deposits. The newly defined upper Pleistocene Whangaehu Formation provides evidence for the earliest lahar event in the Valley, c. 180,000- 140,000 years ago. There is only meagre evidence for laharic activity following this event until the Ohakean and Holocene, although two new informally named deposits - the Mangatipona pumice sand (c. 37,000 years B.P.) and Apitian lahars (c. 32,000-25,500 years B.P) - are recognized, of minor extent. The formerly defined late Quaternary Te Heuheu (c. 25,500- 14,700 years B.P.), Tangatu (c. 14,700-5,370 years B.P.), Manutahi (c. 5 ,370-3,4600 years B.P.), Mangaio (c. 4,600 years B.P.) and Onetapu (&lt; c. 1,850 years B.P.) Formations are here described and interpreted. Triggering mechanisms for lahar deposits are distinguished based on lithological criteria. (a) Bouldery deposits in the Whangaehu Formation are interpreted to have been emplaced by a single highly competent debris flow triggered by a southerly-directed flank collapse at Mount Ruapehu. This debris flow was competent enough to transport boulders up to 2 m in diameter over 140 km from the Volcano. Bouldery deposits are also recognized in the Onetapu Formation, but are restricted to higher gradient surfaces on the Mount Ruapehu ring plain. The Onetapu Formation deposits are interpreted to have been emplaced by lahars resulting from catastrophic drainage of Crater Lake, which occupies the active crater on Mount Ruapehu. (b) Pebbly and sandy deposits are interpreted to have been emplaced by low competence debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows. These lahar deposits are recognized in all formations described. The lithology in these deposits is commonly pumice and they are interpreted to have been triggered by eruptions and/or high rainfall events at the Volcano. Formations, and individual members within Formations, were dated by radiocarbon dating of organic material found below, within or above lahar deposits, or by coverbed stratigraphy. Both rhyolitic and andesitic tephras provided recognizable time planes in the late Quaternary coverbeds overlying lahar deposits. In this study quantitative analysis of quartz abundance, which is shown to vary between loesses and palaeosols, is used as an indirect means of establishing a surrogate for past climate changes which have been correlated to the deep sea oxygen isotope curve. A minimum age for the newly defined Whangaehu Formation is established by this method. The accumulation rate for lahars in the Whangaehu River has accelerated from 1 km3 every c. 23,000 years in the past c. 160,000 years to 1 km3 in 589 years in the past c. 2,000 years. This acceleration probably results from the increased frequency of lahars in the River following the development of Crater Lake c. 2,000 years B.P. According to this pattern an estimated 0.17 km3 volume of lahars could be anticipated over the next 100 years. If the 2,000 year accumulation rate were to be met over the next 100 years there would be 170 lahars of l0[superscript]6 m3 in this time interval , or 17 lahars of 10[superscript]7 m3 (or 1.7 lahars of 10[superscript]8 m3). The largest reported volume for an historic lahar is 10[superscript]6 m3 and these have occurred on average once every 30 years. The accumulation rate for historic lahars is 0.0054 km3 in 100 years. Therefore, although the accumulation rate appears to have slowed down, further large lahars with magnitudes 10 or 100 times greater than those witnessed could be expected.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laharic activity</field><field name="subject">Debris flows</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1382</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterization and possible biocontrol application of Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) isolated from NZ sources : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Muftikhar</field><field name="description">Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) are unique, predatory, endoparasitic, Gram-negative bacteria. As the world's smallest living hunter they prey on other Gram-negative bacteria giving them potential as biological control agents. Prior to this study, however, there were no reports of BD in New Zealand. The overall aim of this research was to isolate BD from New Zealand sources, characterise them and investigate their potential role as a biological control agent. The history, characteristics, life cycle and mechanism of predation of this organism are reviewed and the possibility of the industrial applications of BD, are discussed. In this study, a halophilic species of BD was isolated from fourteen coastal sea water sites around New Zealand. Thirteen isolates were characterised using proven characterisation techniques including general, microscopic and molecular techniques. It was found that the isolates were taxonomically identical or very closely related to each other and belong to the genus Bacteriovorax. The predation pattern of BD isolates was examined against a group of Gram negative bacteria in solid and liquid media. The predation patterns and efficiencies of the different BD isolates were similar, which confirms that the BD isolates are closely related, are selective in their predation, and prey on some Gram-negative bacteria but not all. The rapid loss of culture viability of BD is well known, but no studies have been reported to date on the survival of pure cultures of BD at different temperatures. The survival rate of BD in dense suspensions at different temperatures without host bacteria was investigated and it was observed that pure BD cultures can be stored with minimal reduction in numbers at temperatures ranging from 4&#176;C to 20&#176;C. However, significant reductions in numbers were observed at -1 8"C, 30&#176;C and 37&#176;C after 13 to 16 days. The effects of the 13 New Zealand BD isolates on the growth of a population of Photobacterium phosphoreum were examined to select the best isolate for in vitro application. All of the isolates tested had considerable reduction effect against P. phosphoreum. Some isolates were more effective than others, despite their taxonomic similarity to each other. The isolate OT2 was selected for further studies based on these results. The in vitro efficacy of BD was assessed against late exponential cultures of a seafood spoilage bacterium, P. phosphoreum, originally isolated from Cod fillets from Denmark. Loglo reductions of P. phosphoreum and some other Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 4.5 to 4.8 after 9 h of incubation at 25OC. BD was effective in reducing the numbers of P. phosphoreum at pH 5.5 to 8.5 and salinity 0.9 to 4.5% (wlv). A significant interaction was observed between the prey and predator concentrations and nutrient concentration. Prey concentrations were observed to be the most vital factor in predation and the most favourable predation conditions were at a prey concentration of -8 loglo colony forming units (CFU)/mL, together with a predator concentration of 3 - 7 loglo plaque forming units (PFU)/mL and a prey : predator ratio of &gt;5.0. The thresholds of the prey and predator concentrations for predation were observed to be 3.7 loglo CFUImL and 3.9 loglo PFUImL, respectively. The trials carried out in this study focused on the efficiency of BD on a pure culture of one organism, P. phosphoreum and not on mixed cultures of Gramnegative spoilage bacteria, the normal condition observed in saltwater fish. There has been very little research in this field and the results of these trials suggest further investigation into the effect of BD on mixed cultures of Gram-negative spoilage organisms is warranted. Since only one isolate of BD (OT2) was examined against only one spoilage bacterium (P. phosphoreum) in liquid medium, the evidence of these findings must be restricted to these particular conditions. Future studies, using a range of BD isolates against a mixture of spoilage and pathogenic organisms in solid medium are warranted. The biopreservation capability of BD in extending the shelf life of king salmon was evaluated. A significant effect was observed at 20&#176;C but not at 10&#176;C. At 20&#176;C the shelf life was extended through extension of the lag phase of growth of the prey bacteria and a reduction in total numbers attained. Sensory evaluation of the salmon product being tested confirmed that the shelf life was extended. However, at 10&#176;C there was no reduction in prey organisms, which suggested that the strain of BD used is ineffective at refrigeration temperatures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</field><field name="subject">Photobacterium phosphoreum</field><field name="subject">Fishery products</field><field name="subject">Biocontrol</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1392</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Convergence rates of stochastic global optimisation algorithms with backtracking : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Statistics at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Alexander, D.L.J.</field><field name="description">A useful measure of quality of a global optimisation algorithm such as simulated annealing is the length of time it must be run to reach a global optimum within a certain accuracy. Such a performance measure assists in choosing and tuning algorithms. This thesis proposes an approach to obtaining such a measure through successive approximation of a generic stochastic global optimisation algorithm with a sequence of stochastic processes culminating in backtracking adaptive search. The overall approach is to approximate the progress of an optimisation algorithm with that of a model process, backtracking adaptive search. The known convergence rate of the model then provides an estimator of the unknown convergence rate of the original algorithm. Parameters specifying this model are chosen based on observation of the optimisation algorithm. The optimisation algorithm may first be approximated with a time-inhomogeneous Markovian process defined on the problem range. The distribution of the number of iterations to convergence for this averaged range process is shown to be identical with that of the original process. This process is itself approximated by a time-homogeneous Markov process in the range, the asymptotic averaged range process. This approximation is defined for all Markovian optimisation algorithms and a weak condition under which its convergence time closely matches that of the original algorithm is developed. The asymptotic averaged range process is of the same form as backtracking adaptive search, the final stage of approximation. Backtracking adaptive search is an optimisation algorithm which generalises pure adaptive search and hesitant adaptive search. In this thesis the distribution of the number of iterations for which the algorithm runs in order to reach a sufficiently extreme objective function level is derived. Several examples of backtracking adaptive search on finite problems are also presented, including special cases that have received attention in the literature. Computational results of the entire approximation framework are reported for several examples. The method can be applied to any optimisation algorithm to obtain an estimate of the time required to obtain solutions of a certain quality. Directions for further work in order to improve the accuracy of such estimates are also indicated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Convergence rate</field><field name="subject">Markov process</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230202 Stochastic analysis and modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1613</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward sound management of end-of-life vehicles in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Economics, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cassells, Susan Mary</field><field name="description">New Zealand has a problem with an increasing number of motor vehicles being abandoned at the end of their useful life. The environmental and associated social costs created by this problem are expected to increase with the rising number of vehicles entering the country. In addition, there are environmental concerns regarding some aspects of the legal disposal of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). The exact magnitude of both problems is unknown and attempts made to address them have been ad hoc and success limited. This thesis sets out to quantify the problems and provide policy makers with tools to improve the overall management of motor vehicle disposal in New Zealand. To assess the extent and cost of the abandoned vehicle problem, local authorities are surveyed. The legislation dealing with car ownership, transferral and disposal and its implementation are scrutinised for weaknesses that allow ELVs to be abandoned without penalty. The automobile recycling industry is surveyed to determine the environmental impact from the industry's activities. Using semi-structured surveys, policies and practices used in other countries for the management of ELVs are investigated and assessed for effectiveness. Their application to the New Zealand situation is ascertained. Of the vehicles which are deregistered each year, one in five is dumped. The direct cost to local authorities, to deal with the 25,500 vehicles abandoned each year, is more than six million dollars. In addition, practices and standards for the removal and disposal of hazardous substances from ELVs vary nationwide, adding to the environmental burden caused by vehicle disposal. Recommendations for the improved management of ELVs target four areas, legislation, institutional practices, entry into the recycling system and dismantling operations. Minor changes to legislation and institutional practices combined with rigorous enforcement will close the data gaps and overcome free-rider problems. A disposal charge added to the registration fee of vehicles entering the country will allow ELV owners to dispose of their vehicles free-of-charge. Improved environmental performance by automotive dismantlers can be achieved through licensing and consistent monitoring from within the industry. Implementation of these recommendations will lead to better management of ELVs, through changed behaviour by private individuals and dismantling operations, and a reduction in the environmental costs associated with vehicle disposal.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Car disposal</field><field name="subject">Abandoned cars</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340211 Transport economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1614</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tissue-specific responses to water deficit in the New Zealand xerophytic tussock species Festuca novae-zelandiae : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clark, Gregory Thomas</field><field name="description">Festuca novae-zelandiae (Hack.) Cockayne is an endemic New Zealand perennial tussock forming grass of the family Poaceae. Morphologically F. novae-zelandiae exhibits a number of leaf adaptations associated with dehydration postponement as reflected in the climatic distribution of this species and its occurrence as a physiognomic dominant grass in semi arid short-tussock grasslands. Biochemical studies into the drought tolerance of this species have indicated the occurrence of tissue specific responses with respect to abscisic acid (ABA) and proline accumulation and protein turnover suggestive of a preferential protection of the tiller base and associated meristematic zones at the expense of lamina tissues. Further tissue specific biochemical responses to water-deficit stress in F. novae-zelandiae have been investigated. Changes in water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) were monitoured over a 49-day dry-down period (decline in soil water content from 30% to 4%) in consecutive leaf segments comprising the leaf base (meristem region), elongation zone, the enclosed and exposed lamina, as well as basal sheath segments from the two next oldest leaves. In fully hydrated leaf tissues polymers of fructose (fructans) were the main WSC present and were mainly low molecular weight fructans of the inulin and neokestose series with the average degree of polymerization (DP) of fructan pools from 6 to 9. The highest fructan concentrations were present towards the leaf base. Fructan concentrations decreased over the course of the dry-down, although remained significantly higher in the meristem region of the tiller base with respect to any other tissue, until tissue water content fell below 45%. By day 49 of the dry-down period, the average DP of the fructan pool in tissues was from 3 to 5. Sucrose content increased in each tissue during the course of the dry-down, and was highest at the leaf base, where a concentration of 200 &#181;mol g-1 dry weight was measured after 49 days of dry-down. The negative correlation between fructan and sucrose content, which indicates an inter-conversion dependent on tissue water content, suggests that, in this specises, fructans serve as a carbohydrate storage pool, while sucrose stabilises the meristem during extreme water deficit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drought tolerance</field><field name="subject">fructans</field><field name="subject">sucrose</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1615</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with sparsity in genotype x environment analyses : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Statistics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Godfrey, A. Jonathan R.</field><field name="description">Researchers are frequently faced with the problem of analyzing incomplete and often unbalanced genotype-by-environment (GxE) matrices which arise as a trials programme progresses over seasons. The principal data for this investigation, arising from a ten year programme of onion trials, has less than 2,300 of the 49,200 combinations from the 400 genotypes and 123 environments. This 'sparsity' renders standard GxE methodology inapplicable. Analysis of this data to identify onion varieties that suit the shorter, hotter days of tropical and subtropical locations therefore presented a unique challenge. Removal of some data to form a complete GxE matrix wastes information and is consequently undesirable. An incomplete GxE matrix can be analyzed using the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model in conjunction with the EM algorithm but proved unsatisfactory in this instance. Cluster analysis has been commonly used in GxE analyses, but current methods are inadequate when the data matrix is incomplete. If clustering is to be applied to incomplete data sets, one of two routes needs to be taken: either the clustering procedure must be modified to handle the missing data, or the missing entries must be imputed so that standard cluster analysis can be performed. A new clustering method capable of handling incomplete data has been developed. 'Two-stage clustering', as it has been named, relies on a partitioning of squared Euclidean distance into two independent components, the GxE interaction and the genotype main effect. These components are used in the first and second stages of clustering respectively. Two-stage clustering forms the basis for imputing missing values in a GxE matrix, so that a more complete data array is available for other GxE analyses. 'Two-stage imputation' estimates unobserved GxE yields using inter-genotype similarities to adjust observed yield data in the environment in which the yield is missing. This new imputation method is transferrable to any two-way data situation where all observations are measured on the same scale and the two factors are expected to have significant interaction. This simple, but effective, imputation method is shown to improve on an existing method that confounds the GxE interaction and the genotype main effect. Future development of two-stage imputation will use a parameterization of two-stage clustering in a multiple imputation process. Varieties recommended for use in a certain environment would normally be chosen using results from similar environments. Differing cluster analysis approaches were applied, but led to inconsistent environment clusterings. A graphical summary tool, created to ease the difficulty in identifying the differences between pairs of clusterings, proved especially useful when the number of clusters and clustered observations were high. 'Cluster influence diagrams' were also used to investigate the effects the new imputation method had on the qualitative structure of the data. A consequence of the principal data's sparsity was that imputed values were found to be dependent on the existence of observable inter-genotype relationships, rather than the strength of these observable relationships. As a result of this investigation, practical recommendations are provided for limiting the detrimental effects of sparsity. Applying these recommendations will enhance the future ability of two-stage imputation to identify those onion varieties that suit tropical and subtropical locations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistical analyses</field><field name="subject">Onion genotypes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230204 Applied statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1616</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volunteering overseas : motivation, experiences and perceived career effects : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hudson, H. Sheena</field><field name="description">This study concerns self initiated volunteer expatriation. Drawing on data from interviews and test results from a cohort of 48 New Zealand Volunteer Service Abroad volunteers, it explored their experiences as overseas volunteer development workers. Most literature concerning expatriates focuses on the expatriate assignment of managers. By comparison volunteer development workers remain an under-researched group. Moreover, much of the expatriate management literature and the volunteer development worker literature adopts a positivist approach using quantitative methodologies and large scale studies and consider expatriates from a managerial perspective, leaving the perspective of the individual relatively unexplored. This study seeks to focus on volunteer development workers, using qualitative as well as quantitative methodology and considering individual rather than organisational attitudes and behaviour. As a theoretical backdrop, the concepts of "protean" career, (Hall, 2002), "hero's journey", (Osland, 1995) and "career competencies" (De Fillippi &amp; Arthur, 1996) were used as frameworks to assist understanding. The study was longitudinal, and focused on a one-year cohort (2001) of volunteers who provided information on three occasions - before, during, and immediately after their assignment. The study used a mixed- methodology design i.e. was both quantitative and qualitative using both in depth interviews and psychometric testing. The study suggests alternative ways of exploring volunteer expatriation with a specific focus on repositioning the individual at the centre of the study. The study began by focusing and identifying the personalities, (as indicated by the Five Factor Model NEO- PR questionnaire) career values, (as indicated by the Career Orientation Inventory, previous career, attitudes to career and motivation to volunteer (the last two being assessed by a pre-departure structured interview. The experience of VSA assignments was explored by means of a mid-assignment email questionnaire. A second post assignment interview elicited further data on volunteers' experience of VSA, their evaluation of that experience in retrospect, and their plans for further career development. The NEO and COI were re-administered to check changes over time. The study indicated that self direction, challenge, adventure and personal resilience were dominant themes in the attitudes to career, motivations and experiences of the VSA assignment. Openness and agreeableness, significantly greater than population norms were dominant and stable personality traits. In addition, the study reported volunteers' perceived effects of the VSA experience relating to self and career in the forms of increased technical and personal skills, self awareness and challenges to their values. Such outcomes of the study support the use of the "protean "career model (Hall, 1976; Hall, 2002; Briscoe &amp; Hall, 2003) as a way to understand the career transitions made by the volunteers. It also substantiated Osland's (1990; 1995) notion of the metaphor of the hero's journey as an adventure and framework to understand volunteer expatriation and VSA phenomena. In addition, the outcomes supported a model of understanding career competencies as career "capital" used as a framework to understand volunteer motivation and the VSA assignment experience as a career episode.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Volunteer Service Abroad</field><field name="subject">VSA</field><field name="subject">Volunteer workers</field><field name="subject">Expatriates</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1617</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathways from School Bullying to Adult Aggression: A Longitudinal Study</field><field name="creator">Homel, Jacqueline Beatrice</field><field name="description">This study identifies developmental processes underlying the relationship between school bullying and physical aggression in emergent adulthood. The data are drawn from the &#239;&#191;&#189;Life at School&#239;&#191;&#189; project, a longitudinal study of schooling, socio-emotional functioning, and bullying in a sample of young people living in the Australian Capital Territory. This study consists of three waves of self-report data collected from 88 females and 63 males (N=151) during primary school (Time 1), high school (Time 2) and emerging adulthood (Time 3). The study extends earlier analyses to consider the relative significance of distal functioning and the proximal effects of heavy drinking and work/study roles during the transition to emerging adulthood in shaping pathways from school bullying to adult aggression. 
Results showed that bullying in either primary school or high school, and being male, increased the risk of adult aggression. Once bullying and sex were controlled, socio-emotional functioning (including emotion/behaviour regulation and school adjustment) did not make unique contributions to the prediction of adult aggression. To further investigate the effects of bullying, four bully trajectory groups were identified from children&#239;&#191;&#189;s reports: a non-bully group, a child-limited group (bullying during primary school only), an adolescent-onset group (taking up bullying during high school), and a persistent group (bullying during both primary and high school). Moderated regression showed that a) frequent drinking at Time 3 significantly increased aggression only for the persistent bully group, and b) participation in university study, in comparison with being in the workforce, was significantly associated with lower levels of aggression only for persistent and adolescent-onset bullies. That is, both the past and present were important, but their effects only became apparent when considered in combination.
Given the pivotal significance of drinking and university participation for continuity of aggression, the second analysis stage used path analyses were used to explore the chains of events leading to these adult variables, and subsequent aggression. First, adaptive emotion regulation during high school directly predicted less frequent adult drinking, while continuity in such adaptive regulation between primary and high school was mediated by continuity in positive school connectedness. Second, greater parental education increased the likelihood that young people would attend university, both directly, and indirectly by increasing academic functioning during high school. In contrast, childhood impulsivity was directly related to a decreased likelihood of university participation and, in turn, to more frequent adult aggression. The final issue examined was the extent to which these mediated pathways from childhood were the same or different across the four bully trajectory groups. Descriptive comparisons indicated that pathways to drinking and work/study role were consistent across the four groups, with the partial exception of the adolescent-onset bullies.
The analyses show that the expression of bullying and adult physical aggression is flexible, open at each stage of development to influence from personal resources (e.g., capacity for adaptive shame management), social resources (e.g., parental education), and changing institutional settings, through for example the cultural and behavioural norms that characterise the university, workplace, and drinking environments and which constrain aggressive behaviour or promote a sense of future orientation. Patterns of adult aggressive behaviours are thus shaped not just by past bullying, but by the subtle interplay of emergent adult settings and experiences, socio-emotional functioning in school contexts, and family social capital.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggression</field><field name="subject">bullying</field><field name="subject">developmental psychopathology</field><field name="subject">developmental psychology</field><field name="subject">socioemotional development</field><field name="subject">school adjustment</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">drinking</field><field name="subject">longitudinal</field><field name="subject">emotion regulation</field><field name="subject">emerging adulthood</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100901.104617</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management in Malaysian five star hotels: Human resource practices system differentiation and its outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rozila Ahmad</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis explores the management of human resources (HR) in five star hotels located in a developing country (Malaysia). This study is particularly relevant to the hotel industry, known for its traditionally poor HR practices (e.g., a lack of employment security, training, and career development opportunity, low levels of employee involvement and an increasing number of casual employees who are paid hourly). These practices are often perceived as a solution to high labour costs and fluctuating demand prevalent in the hotel industry. However, it is often only "non-managerial" employees who are affected by poor HR practices, as more sophisticated approaches to HR practices are often taken with regard to managerial (strategic) level employees. HR practices system differentiation (HRPSD), or HR architecture, involves having more than one HR practices system within an organisation. HRPSD has been criticised in the hospitality management literature for the poor HR practices in the management of non-managerial employees, however despite this criticism, it is widely practiced by the industry. The continuation of HRPSD practices in the hotel industry suggests its importance to better understand, research and study. The aim of this research is to gain an understanding of HRPSD in a hotel industry context, and to better understand the immediate effects of such practices. While the existing literature concerning HR architecture in other industries provides some discussion of HRPSD, research and study of the concept focusing on the hotel industry is essential in providing a detailed explanation of the effect of this phenomenon, as HR practices between industries may vary. Central to this study, is an investigation of the nature of HRPSD, identification of HR intermediate outcomes, and the effects of HRPSD on hotel employees. Studying the effect of HRPSD on employees is important because employees are known to be a hotel organisations&#8223; most important resource. Developed based on the literature of SHRM and HR architecture, this study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates HRPSD in the SHRM model originally proposed by Schuler, Dowling, Smart, and Huber (1992). Guided by this model, this study seeks to answer the critical questions of &#8220;how organisations differentiate their HR practices systems&#8221; and &#8220;what are the corresponding HR intermediate outcomes?&#8221; A particular foci of this thesis relates to how the concept of a &#8220;strategic&#8221; (or managerial) job is conceptualised in the hotel industry, what the elements of HR practices systems in five-star hotels are, how and why hotel organisations differentiate their HR practices systems, what the HR intermediate outcomes of HRPSD are and how HRPSD relates to the identified HR intermediate outcomes. To answer these complex research issues, a multiple case research methodology is employed, utilising a series of in depth semi-structured interviews. This vi study focuses specifically on five-star hotels in Malaysia because HR practices vary among hotels of various sizes. The findings indicate a notable effect of HRPSD on employees&#8223; motivation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and retention, and that excessive differentiation is not beneficial for a five star hotel. In this study only certain HR practices were found to be differentiated; selective staffing, extensive training, compensation and empowerment. HR practices that were applied to all employees without differentiation were a clear job description, orientation, employment security, objective performance appraisal, career development opportunity and effective communication. In addition, this study also provides a clear definition of the strategic job in the hotel industry, and demonstrates the importance of HR practices integration and the influence of internal and external environments on the formation of HR strategy. This research contributes to theory as well as hotel sector policy and practice. Theoretically, it has identified how HRPSD links to firm performance (in Malaysian five star hotels). In addition, it provides clear definitions and understanding of the strategic job concept as well as identification of HR practices system elements and their differentiation in five-star hotels. Furthermore, the theoretical framework developed can be useful for future quantitative studies which can test the model formulated in this study. For practitioners, the detailed examination of HR practices system elements and how they are differentiated may guide them in their future HR strategy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel, strategy, human resource management, practices system, differentiation, intermediate outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205690</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Healing architecture': A study of daylight in public hospital designs in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Srazali Aripin</field><field name="description">In the hospital building, where patients seek medical treatment and hospital staff provide continuous support, creating a healing environment is an imperative. However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion of the Concept of Sustainable Tourism Development: A Case Study on Kret Island, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Siriphen Dabphet</field><field name="description">Sustainable tourism development is widely accepted as an alternative approach to tourism development in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable in part to a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders&#8217; understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to destination stakeholders as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">sustainable tourism development, diffusion of innovation theory, communication channels, innovation characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208107</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and structure of racemic and non-racemic natural products including allenes</field><field name="creator">McGrath, M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">250399 Organic Chemistry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780103 Chemical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106665</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A transgenic analysis of the basis for growth signaling by the growth hormone receptor</field><field name="creator">Rowland, J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320602 Cell Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106632</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedogeomorphic terrain analysis for forestland resource management: Science and practice</field><field name="creator">Thwaites, R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105510</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environment, development and trade: The case of Shrimp farming in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Lavantucksin, V.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">760202 Economic incentives and regulation</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105532</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The neuromuscular responses to resistance training</field><field name="creator">Carroll, T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105635</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relative stiffness and superelastic properties of orthodontic wires</field><field name="creator">Tan, E.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105743</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Morphological changes during normal and perturbed metamorphosis of the ascidian Herdmania curvata</field><field name="creator">Green, K.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270603 Animal Physiology - Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105844</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Study of Animal Models of Cerebral Ischaemia</field><field name="creator">Mullins, P.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270802 Diagnostic Applications</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105876</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasonic investigation of burning metals in normal and reduced gravity</field><field name="creator">Chiffoleau, G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">299902 Combustion and Fuel Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105948</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longitudinal investigation of mirror self-recognition, pretend play and imitation in human infants</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, M.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy -

It is biologically inactive until bound in a pterin compound named the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) that binds to apoproteins used in both reductive and oxidative reactions such as nitrate reductase (NR), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase (AO) and sulfite oxidase (SOX). In Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot, molybdenum deficiency is common amongst vines grown on own roots in acidic soils often resulting in yield reductions. Foliar application of molybdenum sprays increases yield and remedies deficiency indicating that Merlot grown on own roots has a reduced capacity for molybdenum uptake from the soil. Molybdenum generally occurs as molybdate (MoO&#8324;  &#178;&#8315;) within the soil solution. The mechanism(s) involved in molybdenum transport have recently been discovered in plants, although are well characterised within prokaryotic systems. Unfortunately, no homologues of prokaryotic genes involved in molybdate transport exist within eukaryotes. It has been suggested that molybdenum transport in plants may occur through other systems including sulfate transporters due to chemical similarities between sulfate and molybdate. A yeast functional complementation approach using a sulfate transport mutant was initially used to identify novel putative plant molybdenum transport proteins. A cDNA library derived from Pinot noir roots starved of molybdenum was screened for transporters. Unfortunately, no cDNAs were identified that met the requirements of a molybdenum transporter when screened on media containing low amounts of molybdenum. However, a number of putative cDNA&#8217;s partially complemented the yeast mutant YSD1, however none of these could be validated in second round screens. A candidate gene approach was then initiated to identify pre-characterised genes that may also have capacity to transport molybdenum. The plant sulfate transporter, SHST1, restored growth of YSD1 on media containing low amounts of molybdenum. Kinetic analysis using &#8313;&#8313;MoO&#8324;&#178;&#8315; to trace molybdenum transport in yeast cells demonstrated that SHST1 enhanced the uptake of molybdenum at nM concentrations. The uptake was not inhibited by sulfate, but the transport of sulfate was reduced with molybdenum. Further analysis demonstrated that SHST1 did prefer sulfate as the substrate but molybdenum could compete at higher concentrations. This result is the first measurement of molybdenum being transported through a pre characterised sulfate transport protein. Whole plant experiments using rooted grapevine cuttings and &#8313;&#8313;MoO&#8324;&#178;&#8315; to trace molybdenum movement into plants indicated that Merlot did not have reduced capacity to uptake molybdenum compared to other varieties that do not suffer from molybdenum deficiencies such as Chardonnay. When plants were grown with molybdenum, Merlot accumulated more molybdenum than Chardonnay, with the reverse being true when plants were grown without molybdenum. Similar experiments were performed on symbiosomes isolated from Glycine max grown with and without molybdenum. Symbiosomes absorbed more molybdenum when plants were grown without molybdenum. A field site was established to look at the molybdenum profiles within petioles against yield responses over a 3-year period. Molybdenum application did not increase the yield amongst vines despite all vines initially being deficient in molybdenum. There were no cumulative effects of molybdenum application over the trial, however, molybdenum did have limited translocation ability within the vine system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molybdenum transport; sulfate transport; SHST1; YSD1; grapevine; molybdenum nutrition</field><field name="subject">Molybdenum</field><field name="subject">Plants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58573</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and function of Biotin Protein Ligase: a focus on Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans and Homo sapiens.</field><field name="creator">Pendini, Nicole Renee</field><field name="description">Biotin Protein Ligase (BPL) is an essential enzyme responsible for the covalent attachment of biotin to a specific lysine residue of biotin-dependent carboxylases, transcarboxylases and decarboxylases. Due to the fundamental processes that these enzymes are involved in such as lipogenesis, amino acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis, much research has been conducted on these enzymes. Studies encompassing structural, mutational and catalytic functions of these enzymes have lead to novel drug developments for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, bacterial and fungal infections. As BPL is required for activation of these enzymes by biotinylation, it is believed that it too could be targeted in a similar way to produce novel therapeutics. To date, the most characterised BPLs are from the Gramnegative bacteria Escherichia coli and the archea Pyrococcus hirokoshii. However minimal information is known about other forms of clinically important bacterial species or eukaryotic forms of this important enzyme. Through my candidature I have compiled a thorough literature review summarised as chapter 1: Introduction. Furthering this literature analysis, a human BPL model was generated with aid of BPL structural co-ordinates already deposited in the protein data bank (PDB), thus allowing focus on human BPL mutations that cause multiple carboxylase deficiency (chapter 2). I have solved the structure of BPL from the clinically important pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. This was performed in several ligand-bound and non-bound states (chapters 3 and 4). A novel high-throughput assay was developed to test BPL activity. This assay allow testing of compounds that could potentially inhibit the BPL from Candida albicans (a species responsible for invasive fungal infections) (chapter 5). Large amounts of highly purified BPL from Saccharomyces cerevisiae allowed for the first structural analysis of a eukaryotic BPL (Chapter 6). The work has been summarised by a general discussion and future directions for the project (Chapter 7).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crystallography; X-ray diffraction; structural biology; protein structure; biotin; enzymatic biotinylation; biotin protein ligase; staphylococcus aureus; saccaromyces cerevisiae; candida albicans; homosapiens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60390</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semilinear stochastic differential equations with applications to forward interest rate models.</field><field name="creator">Mark, Kevin</field><field name="description">In this thesis we use techniques from white noise analysis to study solutions of semilinear stochastic differential equations in a Hilbert space H: {dX[subscript]t = (AX[subscript]t + F(t,X[subscript]t)) dt + &#417;(t,X[subscript]t) &#948;B[subscript]t, t&#8712; (0,T], X[subscript]0 = &#958;, where A is a generator of either a C[subscript]0-semigroup or an n-times integrated semigroup, and B is a cylindrical Wiener process.

In order to utilize plant residues for increasing soil organic matter more effectively, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of plant residue decomposition. Soil organic matter decomposition is influenced by several factors such as plant residue quality, temperature, water availability, soil structure and soil texture, particularly clay content. The interaction of clay and decomposition of organic matter has been studied in the past. Nevertheless, many studies investigated this interaction in natural soil or under field conditions over long periods of time. Variation in environmental factors may influence the interaction of clay and decomposition of organic matter, thus in most previous studies their effect cannot be separated from the direct effect of clay on decomposition. To study the direct effect of clay on organic matter decomposition, four experiments with different objectives were carried out using isolated natural clay, under controlled conditions (e.g. temperature and organic matter input) and a short incubation period (approximately one month). All experiments were carried out using a sand matrix to which different clay types, clay fractions (natural or with iron oxide partially removed) or clay concentrations were added together with mature wheat straw (C/N 122 in most experiments, except Experiment 2 where the wheat straw had a C/N of 18) and a microbial inoculum. To investigate the effect of clay type, two clay types were added. They were isolated from Wiesenboden (W) and Red Brown Earth (RBE) soil. Clay types from both soils contained kaolinite and illite, but smectite only occurred in W clay. Iron oxide is thought to be important for the binding of organic matter to clay, therefore two clay fractions were used, the clay with native iron oxide (natural clay) and clay from which iron oxide was partially removed by citrate-dithionite-bicarbonate treatment (citrate-dithionite clay, CD clay). The following parameters were measured: pH, water loss, respiration rate, microbial community structure using phospholipid fatty acid analysis and, in some experiments, particulate organic matter. In all experiments, the water content of the substrate mixes was adjusted only at the start; water loss was greatest in the control and decreased with increasing clay content. The aim of the first experiment was to study the effect of the concentration of W clay on decomposition of wheat residues. Respiration (i.e. decomposition of the wheat straw) was affected by clay in two ways (i) decreased decomposition, thus protection of organic matter, in the initial phase at all concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40%) and throughout the incubation period at &#8804; 20% clay, and (ii) greater water retention at higher clay concentration particularly 40% clay that allowed maintenance of higher respiration rates towards the end of incubation. Generally, clay concentration had an effect on microbial community structure but not on microbial biomass. The effect of clay concentration was also investigated in the second experiment, but using RBE clay and a narrower range of concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 20% clay) than in the first experiment with W clay. The wheat residue used in this experiment had a lower C/N ratio compared to the other three experiments (C/N 18 compared to 122). In contrast to the first experiment, cumulative respiration of the clay treatments was greater than that of control throughout the incubation, thus clay increased rather than decreased decomposition. This may be due to the properties of the wheat residue used in this experiment which contained more water-soluble compounds, the diffusion of which would be enhanced in treatments with clay compared to the control due to their higher water availability. However, considering only the treatments with added clay, cumulative respiration followed the same pattern as in the first experiment, with highest cumulative respiration at 20% clay. In general, microbial community structure, microbial biomass and microbial groups (i.e. bacterial and fungal fatty acids) were affected by the presence of clay and sampling time, but there was no clear relationship between these factors and the richness and diversity of the microbial community. The aim of the third experiment was to determine the effect of clay concentration (5 and 40% of W clay) and fraction (natural or citrate-dithionite clay) on decomposition of wheat straw and microbial community structure. Clay fraction and concentration strongly affected the respiration rate and microbial community structure as well as microbial biomass but not the concentration of particulate organic matter (POM). Compared to the control, partial removal of iron oxide strongly increased decomposition at both concentrations whereas clay with iron oxides reduced the decomposition. Microbial community structure was affected by clay fractions, particularly at 40% clay. The aim of the fourth experiment was to determine the effect of clay fraction (natural and citrate-dithionite clay) and clay type (W clay or RBE clay) at 5% clay on decomposition of wheat straw and microbial community structure. Clay type and the partial removal of iron oxide had a significant effect on the decomposition rate but did not affect POM concentration. As in the third experiment, partial removal of iron oxide increased respiration rate, the effect was less pronounced in RBE clay than in W clay. Clay type and fraction strongly affected microbial community structure. In conclusion, the experiments showed that native clay generally reduces organic matter decomposition by binding and occlusion. The importance of iron oxide for the protective effect of clay on organic matter decomposition was shown by the fact that partial removal of iron oxide strongly increased decomposition rate compared to the native clay. The two clay types differed in their effect. The W clay containing smectite protects organic matter to a greater extent than RBE clay with predominantly illite and kaolinite due to its higher surface area and CEC that lead to binding and or occlusion. The results also showed that although clay reduces organic matter decomposition under optimal water availability, this effect can be reversed as the substrates dry out because the greater water retention of substrates with clay concentrations &gt; 10% compared to the pure sand matrix allows maintenance of a greater microbial activity. Clay type, fraction and concentration affected microbial community structure via their effect on organic matter and water availability.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant residue decomposition; clay; iron oxides; respiration; microbial biomass; microbial community structure; particulate organic matter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60392</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solidarity?: A comparative study of trades unions in the conscription debate in New Zealand and Australia during the Great War.</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Robert Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative study of trades unions in the conscription debate in Australia and New Zealand during the Great War. The governments of Australia and New Zealand looked to conscription to maintain the supply of men in the war effort. However, when they declared conscription for overseas service was necessary, most unions opposed it, although some unions in both countries were divided over the issue.  New Zealand&#8217;s unions fought for the repeal of the Military Service Act, which compelled men between the ages of 20 and 46 years to register for overseas military service. Australian unions fought for the defeat of two plebiscites conducted by the government of the day regarding the invocation of conscription. Several factors influenced unions to oppose conscription. Through the use of trades union and government archival material, particularly minutes of meetings, correspondence, annual reports, conference minutes, diary entries, government documents, pamphlets, biographies, union and contemporary newspapers, it is possible to establish why unions took their stance. In this thesis the factors that shaped the stance of unions on conscription are presented; including the circumstances of the formation of unions, their early history and influences, and their attitudes to compulsory military training. Evidence is also presented regarding the relationship between the union movement and the government of each country, and it is posited that these relationships were influential in the outcome of the conscription debate in the respective countries. Unions in both countries campaigned vigorously to stop conscription. Only in Australia were they successful.   When war was declared in 1914, unionists from both countries balanced union beliefs against other factors. Unionists were concerned that this war was a class war, incorporating inequality of sacrifice. Unionists were also concerned about provisions for families of those serving, the cost of living and loss of civil liberties; none of which were addressed by the governments of the day in the opinion of unionists. Unionists feared economic and industrial conscription. Other unionists simply lacked a belief in war and opposed it. Unionists, in general, opposed the manufacture of war materials. However, this war was also considered to be a necessary evil. Opposition to conscription was counter-balanced with patriotism and belief in the evil of Germany, with the result that many unionists enlisted voluntarily for overseas service. When conscription became the issue, unionists in both countries opposed it. The New Zealand government legislated for a Military Service Act which the unions attempted to have repealed, but in Australia the government held two plebiscites on conscription to determine the wishes of the populace. Both were defeated, the unions claiming victory.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trades unions; conscription; New Zealand; Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60393</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructor attention to oral reading errors: a functional analysis</field><field name="creator">McNaughton, Stuart, 1950</field><field name="description">The effect of attention to oral reading errors has received little specific examination by researchers in applied behaviour analysis. Some data suggest attending to such errors can have inappropriate effects on learning. A conceptual framework was developed to examine the effects of error attention on the acquisition of proficient reading responses. Analyses of reading behaviour employed concepts and data from 'structural' accounts of reading. These concepts provided details of the components of response systems. Acquisition of proficient reading was seen to involve trends towards accurate integrated responding which becomes self controlled. Error attention was conceptualised as having motivational and informational properties which could directly affect acquisition trends. The first experiment (Chapter Three) demonstrated that under appropriate conditions oral reading behaviour was facilitated by error attention. Eleven year old readers in a Learning Disabilities classroom were measured in their usual reading setting. Two readers received extra tutoring with error attention procedures. A further two readers acted as a contrast for the effects of increased opportunities to respond. These readers received extra practice tutoring with minimum levels of praise. A third subject received no extra tutoring during the course of the experiment. Results indicated that both practice and error attention produced substantial increases in accuracy and correct rates. Accuracy levels were higher for error attention subjects suggesting error attention can have important learning outcomes. Additionally, predictions concerning the error attention dimensions of modeling and prompting were tested. Prompts were found to be more effective with the more proficient reader while models were more effective with the less proficient reader. The second experiment (Chapter Four) examined specific predictions about timing of error attention. Six, 6 year old normal readers received daily sessions of either delayed or immediate attention to errors. Every second day the subjects also read a text on which they were not tutored. Results showed that delayed attention increased the percent of errors self corrected for five subjects in both the tutored and non tutored texts. Increases in self corrections were consistently associated with increased accuracy. The data supported both the predictions and the proposed model of self correction behaviour as having a tutorial or self instruction function. Both experiments were discussed in terms of the functions of error attention in facilitating acquisition of proficient reading. Methodological issues in the behaviour analysis of oral reading were also discussed and implications from the studies for instruction in learning to read are drawn. The usefulness of concepts from 'structural' accounts of reading for a predictive 'functional' account of error attention is examined in a concluding section.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic effects of general anaesthetics : a suite of clinical studies and theoretical models</field><field name="creator">Sleigh, James Wallace</field><field name="description">The primary object of this thesis was to investigate aspects of empirically-measured, anaesthesia-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that could be explained by network models of cortical interactions. The thesis consists of a collection of various theoretical and clinical papers in three sections: (a) A background section summarizing previous relevant published works on the molecular actions of anaesthetic agents, and the origin and problems with the acquisition of the EEG. (b) A second section dealing with the development of various theoretical / computer models of general anaesthetic action. (c) A third section of various clinical and EEG studies of anaesthesia and sleep. These were done to confirm and clarify some of the theoretical results from the models. However there are many different ways of numerically capturing the information contained within the EEG. Because this problem needed to be overcome before the primary aim of the thesis could be accurately handled; the clinical studies tended to be diverted into this secondary "signal-acquisition" aspect of the EEG analysis in anaesthesia and sleep. Because the thesis has a constellation of different interlocking threads of investigation, I have summarized the various themes in the following table. (A) Background Section The relevant conclusions from the background section were: 1) The transition from aesthesia to anaesthesia involved the whole animal, and thus may not be entirely measurable by the EEG. In contrast the transitions from consciousness to coma - and even more specifically - from mnesis to amnesis were predominantly observable by changes in the activity of the cortex and in the resultant EEG signal. 2) The EEG signal arose largely from the summation of coherent post-synaptic potentials in the cortical pyramidal cells. These were, in turn, mainly controlled by cortical layer-l modulation - which was subject to ascending neuromodulatory systems. 3) The main artifacts in the EEG signal were eye-movements, blinks, and frontalis EMG. 4) The Bispectral index (BIS) consisted of three subcomponents. The first two (BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow) probably reflected the loss of high-frequency activity that is associated with the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. 5) The state of the midbrain reticular formation projecting via the non-specific thalamocortical connections can profoundly alter the oscillatory state of the cortex and thence the EEG. Direct or indirect actions of general anaesthetic agents on these structures may be a major cause of the observed EEG changes. These changes are qualitatively similar to the changes observed during natural sleep. 6) Although there was variation between different agents, the most consistent action of commonly-used general anaesthetic agents was to prolong the fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential&gt; 50% by GABAergic potentiation. This action was consonant with the observed EEG effects of anaesthesia - which are (1) an increase in EEG spectral power and frequency followed by, (2) a decrease in dominant frequency and overall power with increasing concentrations: the so-called "biphasic response" There were also a number of more specific features: namely loss of alpha band activity, an initial increase in relative beta activity, followed by a shift to lower frequencies, spindles - and in deep anaesthesia - burst suppression patterns. Other contributions to anaesthetic action may include: (1) inhibition of NMDA receptor function, (2) reduction of nicotinic acetylcholine modulation, and (3) a direct hyperpolarizing action by opening potassium channels. Anaesthetic agents disrupted cortical function at lower doses than those required for inhibition of brain stem function. (B) Theoretical Models The fact that the cerebral cortex consisted of, effectively, a two-dimensional interconnecting neural network was of overriding importance. All the theoretical models were constrained by this topological fact, and showed a remarkable degree of similarity. Regardless of whether the model was continuous (appendix 2) or discrete (cellular automata), some robust and consistent features emerged: 1) Some form of abrupt decrease in information flow within the network occurred when the interaction between the network elements was interrupted greater than certain critical threshold amount - the order/disorder phase transition. 2) This critical point was manifest as (i) a large change in the simulated mean soma potential (the order parameter), (ii) divergence of the spectral power of the simulated pseudoEEG signal, and (iii) decrease in frequency content (in the cellular automaton models). Unfortunately the order parameter for the EEG is probably unmeasurable in clinical practice. The first derivative is measurable, but not completely reliable as a proxy order parameter. 3) All models required some form of noisy external (subcortical) input to drive them. Variations in this input could explain some of the anomalies observed in the clinical section of the thesis. (C) Clinical Papers The clinical papers were a series of papers recording the clinical data, which then influenced the development of the theoretical models. The single most popular clinical measure of anaesthetic depth in present practice is the Bispectral Index (BIS). Many of these studies explore the strengths and weaknesses of this index in various clinical situations. The main disadvantage of the BIS was that crucial aspects of its formulation are not in the public domain for commercial reasons. We attempted to separate out the changes in the various subcomponents of the BIS in patients under general anaesthesia, and natural sleep. 1) In the first paper we described how the EEG changed during induction and recovery from general anaesthesia with propofol and isoflurane. We compared EEG vs heart rate variability changes as monitors of anaesthetic depth. This study served to evaluate a clinically accepted measure of anaesthetic depth, as well as gaining practical EEG experience in collecting experimental data, both using the ASPECT EEG monitor, and in devising the best clinical methods of quantifying levels of consciousness. The main results were that the BIS was relatively reliable in steady-state conditions, and better than the raw 95% spectral edge frequency, and the approximate entropy of the EEG. 2) Auditory recall and response-to-command during recovery from propofol anaesthesia. In this paper we were able to collect data in a very controlled situation, somewhat different from that pertaining to clinical practice. From this we were able to identify separate components of consciousness and mnesis and how they correlated with EEG changes. We were also able to compare frontal and parietal EEG data. We established that there is a clear divergence of spectral power around the time of loss-of-consciousness when the propofol was administered as a slow infusion. This is good evidence supporting the basis of the theoretical models. This experiment also established that it is possible for a patient to be conscious, not paralyzed, but not responding to verbal command. 3) Electroencephalographic measures of depth of anaesthesia: the importance of the gamma band and the electromyogram signal. This study was concerned with different technical aspects of EEG signal acquisition and processing. It suggested that usually the EMG is not a significant problem, and that the gamma (40-60Hz) frequency band is important in distinguishing the awake from the anaesthetized state. 4) The Bispectral Index: A Measure of Depth of Sleep? Because the EEG changes of general anaesthesia are very similar to those of sleep, this study was a simple observational study collecting some information about changes in the BIS with natural sleep. 5) The Bispectral Index and Sleep Stage: A Polysomnographic study. In this study we formally compared the BIS with a full polysomnogramnographic sleep staging. It confirmed the results of the previous study, and demonstrated that the subcomponents of the BIS (the BetaRatio and the SynchFastSlow) changed in a manner very similar to those observed under general anaesthetic. Conclusions The observed changes in the EEG on induction of anaesthesia can be explained by changes in relatively simple theoretical network models. These changes can be reliably reduced to univariate Parameters</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure of the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal field (New Zealand) based on interpretation of seismic and gravity data</field><field name="creator">Henrys, S.(Stuart)</field><field name="description">The structure of the Broadlands-Ohaaki hot water geothermal field has been studied by analysis of seismic and gravity data. The 1984 seismic survey provided 26 km of multifold (12-fold) reflection data and refraction data (up to 1 km) along 6 profiles in the vicinity of the geothermal field. Test data were acquired along 2 profiles of 1 km length and included a walk-away noise spread. An attempt was also made to record shear-waves (SV) along one profile with in-line horizontal geophones. Processing of reflection data indicated the importance of static corrections, velocity filtering and spectral balancing of the trace amplitude spectrum before deconvolution. Delay times from the analysis of refracted (first) arrivals outline areas of anomalous low velocity that coincide with areas of highest surface temperatures (&gt;50&#176;C at 15 m depth). Ray trace modelling of travel times near the Ohaaki Pool delineate an anomalously low-velocity zone to a depth of 200 m. The frequency and amplitude of the recorded signals near the Ohaaki Pool are attenuated in comparison to field records from outside areas with high surface temperatures. Converted shear-waves indicate that Poisson's ratio is low (0.17 to 0.20) in this area. These effects are consistent with a steam/water zone occurring close to the surface Common-mid-point derived velocities and ray-tracing inversion of reflecting horizons were used to determine the 3-dimensional velocity distribution beneath the geothermal field. A low-velocity zone, in which velocities are 10-20% lower inside the geothermal field, coincides with the region of highest signal attenuation (Q&lt;20), the productive borefield, and the region of highest fluid temperature (&gt;250&#176;C at 1000 m depth) The seismic stratigraphy of the volcanic units was established using drill hole data and synthetic seismograms. The top and bottom of the Ohaaki Rhyolite and Broadlands Dacite account for the major reflecting horizons with occasional less strong reflections from the top of the Rangitaiki Ignimbrite. However, even strong reflectors are not coherent across any single section and the top of the rhyolite and dacite flows may show up with strong reflections at one part of the profile, but elsewhere with weak or no reflections. The limited success in enhancing signal quality below 500-700 m depth is attributed to a combination of noise generated in the 1ow velocity surface layer and the complexity of the geological structure at depth. Analysis of noise characteristics of the Broadlands-Ohaaki reflection data included computation of synthetic seismograms and spectral analysis of recorded seismograms. Theoretical modelling of near-surface structures showed that prominent low-frequency noise trains observed in field data are due to waves trapped in the surface layer that are excited by direct waves from shallow (5-10 m) shots. A very rapid increase in seismic wavespeed occurs at the water table and causes the surface layer to act as a waveguide which traps low-frequency Rayleigh waves and air-coupled Rayleigh waves visible on near offset traces. Compressional energy is also efficiently converted into shear-waves (SV) and is dominant as reverberating reflected refracted energy at far offsets (&gt;400 m). In addition, there is resonant coupling between the surface waves and multiple reflections. Surface-consistent spectral analysis indicates that variation in receiver response is a function of the thickness of the low-velocity layer. Reinterpretation of refraction data (1968 survey) by ray-trace modelling elucidated new structural and stratigraphic details which tie in with well data and confirms the velocity structure established from reflection data. Near offset refracted arrivals clearly define the top of the Ohaaki Rhyolite (2200-2800 m/sec) in the western part of the field and the top of the Broadlands Dacite (2650-3200 m/sec) in the east. Longer offset (&gt;3 km) travel times could be modelled as arrivals from the top of the Rautawiri Breccia and Rangitaiki Ignimbrite (velocities between 2800 m/sec and 3800 m/sec). Arrivals from greywacke basement (4500 m/sec) could only be detected in the east outside the geothermal field coming from depths less than 1.0 km. A 3-dimensional interpretation of residual gravity anomalies was also attempted since the seismic sections and detailed well data provide strong constraints. Isodensity and isoporosity contours of the Rautawiri Breccia, Waiora Formation and the Ohaaki Rhyolite reveal areas of high density and 1ow porosity corresponding to the productive regions of the borefield. This density increase is caused by alteration and mineralisation. The detailed interpretation models allow the construction of basement contour and isopach maps. Basement structural-contours show that the basement surface is very complex with significant vertical displacement along a series of predominantly northwest-southeast trending normal faults of limited horizontal extent and with no evidence of significant cross faulting. The basement reaches a maximum depth of 2300 m b.s.l west of the geothermal field. East of the geothermal field the basement rises along a series of northeast-southwest trending normal faults including the Kaingaroa Fault. Isopachs of the producive Rautawiri Breccia and Waiora Formation indicate that the thickest sequence of these units lies to the north and south of the geothermal field apart from at least two structurally controlled depressions inside the field where the thickness of the Rautawiri Breccia is greater than 500 m. Elsewhere, the combined total thickness of these units is less than 400 m. The Broadlands Dacite dome extends over an area of about 16 km2. A magnetic high associated with the Broadlands Dacite is caused by the unaltered, normally magnetised dacite east of the resistivity boundary. Isopachs of the Ohaaki Rhyolite indicate that its thickness increases to the northwest. This finding cannot be reconciled with an earlier concept of a localised Ohaaki dome structure which required a localised feeder dyke within the field. The Ohaaki Rhyolite is probably part of a more extensive chain of rhyolites outcropping to the north and west.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5873</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people.

The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand.

Much has been written about the organic nature of Beethoven&#8217;s later works, but less has been written about the organic coherence found in his earlier compositions. This study involves a motivic analysis of his Op. 2 No. 3 sonata (1795), for which little or no significant research has been carried out. This musical work is used as an illustration of ways in which musical organicism, motivic analysis, and performance can interrelate. The thesis is in three parts. Part one presents a review of late eighteenth-century ideologies of unity and their musical applications. In the search for an effective means of comparing motivic development with organicism, it is then argued that Schenker&#8217;s &#8216;motivic parallelism&#8217; or &#8216;concealed repetition&#8217; is considerably undervalued in his analytical framework. Drawing on the insights of Richard Cohn, I endorse a more autonomous treatment of the motivic parallelism in analysis, so that it is an independent unifying tool in its own right and not only a by-product of tonal analysis. Several approaches are applied to the motivic parallelism in order to illustrate how the parallelism can be used in ways normally only associated with the surface motif. Part two of the thesis consists of a detailed motivic analysis of Beethoven&#8217;s Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. It is argued that the motivic parallelisms contained in this sonata reflect late eighteenth-century ideals of organicism. I propose that there are several motivic cells found in the opening four bars of the sonata, which recur (or are &#8216;paralleled&#8217;) within all structural levels and over all four movements, unifying the sonata organically as one whole. In this way, I show that the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata can be seen to foreshadow the organic treatment of motifs by later composers, who were influenced by Goethe&#8217;s complex prototype (1802) as an organic model.(1) I also offer an &#8216;organic narrative&#8217; for the sonata, using motivic parallelisms as the guiding forces in the discourse. The third and final part relates the motivic parallelisms and other analytical findings to performance. Techniques of &#8216;performing&#8217; motivic parallelisms are discussed and applied to the Op. 2 No. 3 sonata. The organic perspective is proposed as one avenue through which to understand and enhance a performance of a work.  (1) The sonata can also be seen to foreshadow the highly seminal treatment of motifs that was to become more widely used in Beethoven&#8217;s later works (such as the Eroica Symphony).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motivic analysis</field><field name="subject">organic narrative</field><field name="subject">eighteenth-century music</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1000</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">K&#257;ore te aroha-- : te hua o te w&#257;nanga : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Black, Taiarahia</field><field name="description">Te Ora &#274; noho an&#257; n&#333; i te koko ko &#332;hiwa, kia whakarongo rua, Aku taringa ki te Tai o tuar&#257; e o Kanawa, E &#257;ki ana mai ki uta r o &#332;hakana.

In many cases the individuals that are selected for reintroduction are harvested from &#8216;mammal-free&#8217; offshore islands. This thesis examines the effects of isolation from mammalian predators on the predator avoidance behaviours and predator recognition abilities of New Zealand birds using the North Island robin as a model. It also investigates whether any effects of isolation from mammalian predators has a lasting impact on mainland populations founded by individuals from offshore islands. Nest site selection behaviours were compared across three populations that are exposed to different suites of predators and have differing translocation histories; Benneydale, Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm. Point height intercept and point-centred quarter surveys were used to compare habitat availability between the sites and to compare nest sites with the available habitat. Eight nest characteristic variables were also compared across the three sites using a principle component analysis. Benneydale nests were located higher in the trees and were more concealed than nests at the other two sites. Nests on Tiritiri Matangi were supported by large numbers of thin branches and were located toward the periphery of the nest tree. Unfortunately these differences are very difficult to interpret due to a high degree of variation in the habitat types present at the three sites. The anti-predator behaviours initiated in response to a model stoat, model morepork and control were used to test the ability of nesting robins to recognise the threat that each of these treatments might pose to nest success. Behavioural variables were compared between Benneydale, Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm using a response intensity scoring system and a principle component analysis. The results indicated that isolation from mammalian predators on Tiritiri Matangi has suppressed the ability of robins on the island to recognise the predatory threat posed by a stoat. They also suggest that the intense mammal control carried out at Wenderholm may have inhibited the ability of local robins to produce strong anti-predator responses when faced with a stoat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">predator recognition</field><field name="subject">predatory threats</field><field name="subject">island bird sanctuaries</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1142</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VERTIPH : a visual environment for real-time image processing on hardware : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Christopher Troy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents VERTIPH, a visual programming language for the development of image processing algorithms on FPGA hardware. The research began with an examination of the whole design cycle, with a view to identifying requirements for implementing image processing on FPGAs. Based on this analysis, a design process was developed where a selected software algorithm is matched to a hardware architecture tailor made for its implementation. The algorithm and architecture are then transformed into an FPGA suitable design. It was found that in most cases the most efficient mapping for image processing algorithms is to use a streamed processing approach. This constrains how data is presented and requires most existing algorithms to be extensively modified. Therefore, the resultant designs are heavily streamed and pipelined. A visual notation was developed to complement this design process, as both streaming and pipelining can be well represented by data flow visual languages. The notation has three views each of which represents and supports a different part of the design process. An architecture view gives an overview of the design's main blocks and their interconnections. A computational view represents lower-level details by representing each block by a set of computational expressions and low-level controls. This includes a novel visual representation of pipelining that simplifies latency analysis, multiphase design, priming, flushing and stalling, and the detection of sequencing errors. A scheduling view adds a state machine for high-level control of processing blocks. This extended state objects to allow for the priming and flushing of pipelined operations. User evaluations of an implementation of the key parts of this language (the architecture view and the computational view) found that both were generally good visualisations and aided in design (especially the type interface, pipeline and control notations). The user evaluations provided several suggestions for the improvement of the language, and in particular the evaluators would have preferred to use the diagrams as a verification tool for a textual representation rather than as the primary data capture mechanism. A cognitive dimensions analysis showed that the language scores highly for thirteen of the twenty dimensions considered, particularly those related to making details of the design clearer to the developer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">visual programming language</field><field name="subject">field programmable gate arrays</field><field name="subject">human computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280300 Computer Software::280303 Programming languages</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1219</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention.

The thesis begins by asking questions about the status of any account - as description, understanding, or explanation. In the first instance, these questions are discussed within positivist and anti-positivist traditions. Following on from these, the work examines a series of post-positivist approaches that focus on method, general theory, and methatheorising. Many accounts of social science development emphasise the role of a rational social science idea, others stress contextual considerations. In finding these wanting, the thesis argues for the incorporation of culture, structure and agency, and discusses attempts at resolving these within the work of Anthony Giddens and Andrew Abbott. The final part of the theoretical discussion explores the potential of Critical Realism for causal analysis. Within this tradition, Margaret Archer's work is particularly useful with its commitment to robust notions of agency, culture and structure, and emphasising their interplay through time. With some modest revision to attune her position to the demands of practice, the thesis suggests 'Retroductive Narrative Realism' that incorporates ontological insights and the two practical moves of analysis and narrative. The thesis argues that these moves must be explicit, using the analytic to create hypothesis that are then tested via narratives that link emerging structural and cultural forms. The thesis uses this approach for the substantive task of writing a theoretically informed account of social science research. It works within the spheres of State, University and broader social spaces, centring interests and the role of conditioned interaction. The account is presented within four phases: the inheritance - research by the State for the purposes of the State; in search of independent means - research by the State of broader social forms; alternative benefactors - research of social issues by broader social and University interests; on the brink of bankruptcy - a questioning of the State and social forms by social and University interests. Over these four periods it is possible to trace the emergence of social research, then social science, and then specific disciplines.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical realism</field><field name="subject">Margaret Archer</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370106 Sociological methodology and research methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1619</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study into the use of ion beam analysis for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of conducting polymers  : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Moretto, Giovanna Lucia</field><field name="description">Since their discovery in the late 1970s conducting polymers have become increasingly used materials in many applications. They are utilised for their conductivity and/or their electroactive properties. These applications include sensor technologies, actuators, and battery materials. The properties of conducting polymers rely on the extent of the reduction / oxidation or redox state, and hence the dopant levels, of the materials. The aim of this work was to investigate the use of the Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) techniques Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy (RBS), and Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) for the analysis of 'soft' organic materials, in particular, conducting polymers. These IBA techniques are not new, as they have been extensively used for the characterisation of many inorganic, 'hard', materials such as aluminium oxide and silicon oxynitride. While they have been used to alter the molecular structure, and hence the properties of conducting polymers in the past, little to no research has explored the use of ion beams as a tool for the characterisation of these materials. Conducting polymers can either be prepared chemically or electrochemically. They are predominantly prepared in an oxidised state and this charge is balanced by negatively charged counter ions. In this work, the conducting polymers were formed electrochemically by deposition onto support materials at constant electrode potential. The number of counter ions required to balance the polymer chain depends on the type of conducting polymer formed and extent of oxidation. Issues such as the influence of the support material and extent of polymer oxidation on the extent of counter ions through the polymer films are of importance. Gaining knowledge of the dispersion of counter ions may provide new insights into the redox mechanisms for conductive polymers. Complex bis terthiophene porphyrin conducting polymers were prepared and investigated for the uptake of zinc into the freebase porphyrin unit after polymerisation by acquiring elemental depth profiles using RBS analysis. Issues such as the influence of the support material and extent of polymer oxidation on the extent of counter ions through the polymer films were found to be of importance. Gaining knowledge of the extent of counter ions provides new insights into the redox mechanisms for conductive polymers. The results were compared to those obtained for a sample where zinc was coordinated to the porphyrin prior to the polymerisation process. Unexpected high concentrations of both nitrogen and oxygen were found, which were interpreted to be due to entrapped cations originating from the electrolyte ((Bu)4N+), together with trapped water molecules, within the polymer films. The chlorine depth profiling assisted with understanding the extent of the perchlorate counter ion throughout the polymer films. The combination of both RBS and PIXE demonstrated that trace element impurities can be detected using ion beam analysis, which other analytical techniques are unable to do. A series of polypyrrole films incorporating a range of counter ions were prepared as model compounds for study in the second section of this work. RBS and PIXE techniques were used to evaluate film homogeneity with respect to depth and to infer the counter ion / pyrrole unit ratio for each of the six PPy film formed. RBS was also used to characterise a series of terthiophene-ferrocene based conducting co-polymers. The ratio of co-polymer monomer to terthiophene-ferrocene monomers and the dopant levels for the polymers were determined using a RBS deconvolution method developed in this study. This new method can be extended for characterization of a wide range of organic polymers. The limitations of RBS for the analysis of these soft materials were identified. The advantage that RBS offers over other analytical techniques is that it provides a means for low atomic number element depth profiling in these materials.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Counter ions</field><field name="subject">Polymerisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1620</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dynamic light scattering investigation into the dynamics of non ideal ternary polymer solutions : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physics at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nash, William</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Nash, W., Pinder, D.N., Hemar, Y., Singh, H.

It uses the biography of Victoria Wood and her fabrics to argue for the importance of fabric collecting and dressmaking for New Zealand women from 1935 to 1955. It questions why ubiquitous fabrics bought for dress making are not represented in historical accounts of women, or in more general accounts of historical clothing and dress. Aspects of material culture theories are employed to analyse the material properties of the fabric pieces. These are situated within a wider domestic context to demonstrate that there were intrinsic qualities of fabric that influenced and were imagined by many women in this period. Oral histories and other documentary research add to the wider account and provide evidence of the way that dressmaking fabrics reflected the shifting notions of domesticity. The thesis suggests that fabrics bought for the creation of clothing can represent the past or a person. It also demonstrates how dressmaking fabrics simultaneously embody personal and social narratives which reflect the emotional and cultural values of a particular period. In this thesis I construct narratives which are based on the social and historical findings to highlight the importance of fabric collecting and dressmaking as an everyday domestic practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fabric</field><field name="subject">Dressmaking</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1622</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictions and perspectives: Exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and substance use by young males and females.</field><field name="creator">Ms Kim Johnston</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a time of experimentation and exploration. For many young people, a feature of this developmental period is the initiation of substance use. Whilst the majority of young people do not go on to develop substance use problems, any substance use has potential for danger. The current body of literature on the prevention of substance use problems suggests that in order to advance understanding, researchers must adopt a risk-focused approach. There is a wide range of indices that have been cited as risk factors for the development of substance use disorders. Chapter 2 explores some of the aetiological models and literature on risk factors with specific reference to psychological wellbeing, studies highlighting comorbid relationships between adolescent mental health and substance use problems, and the functional value of substances in relation to well-being. Although attention to psychological risk factors has received increased press in the literature, the number of controlled, longitudinal studies is relatively small. A review of recent studies (Chapter 3) indicates that the presence of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or behavioural problems such as delinquency represent psychological risk factors for the development of later substance use problems, however findings are inconsistent and many studies do not examine differential predictive utility by substance or gender. Thus, Study 1 of this research aimed to add to this body of work by exploring the prediction of alcohol, cannabis and other illicit substance use at age fifteen from key indicators of psychological well-being taken at age thirteen. The data from a normative sample of high school students indicated subtle differences in trajectory for young males and females and effects specific to different drug categories. Delinquency emerged as the most consistent predictor in both males and females. Low self-esteem was also an important indicator for future female marijuana use and marijuana intoxication and both male and female other illicit substance use. The findings highlighted the need for a greater contextual understanding of the relationship between delinquency, self-esteem and substance use. The second study sought to provide a deeper understanding of these issues by examining the perceived functional value of substances in relation to psychological wellbeing, by means of a qualitative study of a group of young people who had experienced problems with their substance use. Chapter 4 explores the limited phenomenological research in this area, with a focus on studies which have used methods of measurement that highlight the perspective of young people. Using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach, Study 2 builds on the drug type and gender contrasts noted in Study 1, and explores the interface between substance use and psychological well-being in depth using a clinical population. A number of key functions are identified by young people, with evidence of both convergence and divergence across drug categories (alcohol, cannabis, other illicit substances). Interviewees reported six functions common to all substances; social connectedness, improve affect, positive self-transformation, better coping with problems, fun and laughter, and feeling intoxicated. Nine additional functions were identified in relation to cannabis and other illicit substances. Several gender differences were also noted, with males tending to report more positive reinforcement from alcohol and cannabis, and young females more frequently describing benefits related to use of other illicit substances. The concluding chapter (Chapter 5) reviews the main findings across both studies and their implications for theory, practice, and future research. Overall, the findings of the research provide support for both problem behaviour and adaptive models of adolescent substance use, and indicate that young people are capable of reflecting on their substance use experiences. Incorporating the wisdom of young people into risk frameworks may enhance prevention, education and intervention efforts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent, substance misuse, psychological well-being, consensual qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161713</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Sets in Latin Squares and Associated Structures</field><field name="creator">Bean, Richard Winston</field><field name="description">A critical set in a Latin square of order n is a set of entries in an n x n array which can be embedded in precisely one Latin square of order n, with the property that if any entry of the critical set is deleted, the remaining set can be embedded in more than one Latin square of order n. The number of critical sets grows super-exponentially as the order of the Latin square increases. It is difficult to find patterns in Latin squares of small order (order 5 or less) which can be generalised in the process of creating new theorems. Thus, I have written many algorithms to find critical sets with various properties in Latin squares of order greater than 5, and to deal with other related structures. Some algorithms used in the body of the thesis are presented in Chapter 3; results which arise from the computational studies and observations of the patterns and subsequent results are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The cardinality of the largest critical set in any Latin square of order n is denoted by lcs(n). In 1978 Curran and van Rees proved that lcs(n)&lt;=n2-n. In Chapter 4, it is shown that lcs(n)&lt;=n2-3n+3. Chapter 5 provides new bounds on the maximum number of intercalates in Latin squares of orders mX2^alpha (m odd, alpha&gt;=2) and mX2^alpha+1 (m odd, alpha&gt;=2 and alpha not equal to 3), and a new lower bound on lcs(4m). It also discusses critical sets in intercalate-rich Latin squares of orders 11 and 14. In Chapter 6 a construction is given which verifies the existence of a critical set of size n2 divided by 4 + 1 when n is even and n&gt;=6. The construction is based on the discovery of a critical set of size 17 for a Latin square of order 8. In Chapter 7 the representation of Steiner trades of volume less than or equal to nine is examined.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutionalised organisations?: A study of nonprofit human service organisations</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Catherine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human services -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Women's voluntary work in Queensland and its place-based dimensions.</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Barbara Gail.</field><field name="description">Recent international scholarship has placed new emphasis on women&#8217;s formative role in the social, economic, political and cultural lives of their respective communities. Some researchers have suggested the greatest legacy of women&#8217;s organised contribution to those communities can be found in the history of their voluntary work. Others have urged greater recognition of that contribution through landmark recognition and historic preservation programs. To date, women&#8217;s voluntary work in Queensland has drawn limited scholarly interest and it is not well represented on the State Heritage Register. Attempts to establish links between cultural heritage and women&#8217;s history generally have been restricted to national heritage agencies in North America and Australia. However, methodologies tended to rely on existing historiography which was traditionally non-inclusive of women, and gaps in the record remained a problem. This thesis seeks to address these developments by undertaking a comprehensive gender-sensitive study of women&#8217;s voluntary work and its associated place-based dimensions, across ninety-four groups in Queensland between 1859 and 1959. A central hypothesis asserts women&#8217;s formative role as historical agents and community builders, and argues that participation in voluntary work provided opportunities to enrich and empower lives. A social history approach emphasises the diversity of women&#8217;s volunteer experiences over time and their manifestation in the built environment. The capacity of cultural heritage to effectively and comprehensively represent those experiences and map key contributions to building and shaping communities is also tested. Research confirms a direct correlation between broader historical developments and women&#8217;s volunteer responses in groups. Women reacted proactively, spontaneously and creatively to changing community needs. They committed their collective voluntary labour to address shortcomings in government policies and emerging inequalities in society, to support a nation at war and the work of various Church denominations. These findings validated women&#8217;s creative and progressive agency in volunteer-based groups to building and shaping communities, and confirmed their contribution was sustained and consistent over time. Although most volunteer experiences reflected traditional definitions of gender, more expansive opportunities were available to office-bearers, as well as those involved in self-development groups, the suffrage movement and mobilising for the war effort. Government policy did, however, attempt to restrict women&#8217;s voluntary wartime work to conventional roles, as did male-dominated ecclesiastical views within church-affiliated groups. Regardless of work or group type, evidence suggests that participation was nevertheless an empowering process. It enriched the lives of many women and facilitated their transition from the private domain of home and family to the public arena. The pioneering nature of women&#8217;s voluntary work, especially in nineteenth century Queensland, further enhanced that journey. While voluntary work over this period was dominated mostly by married upper- and middle-class women, single women were well represented. All groups benefitted from career volunteers, who displayed high levels of participation within and across groups. Many participants were motivated by strong altruist ideals, although patriotism and government propaganda played a major role during the war years, as did the influence of the Church and strong Christian beliefs for those involved in groups with a religious affiliation. A key outcome of the study is the identification of some 700 cultural heritages sites, just over half of which appear on an indicative list of places by theme. They reflect the diversity and development of women&#8217;s volunteer experiences in Queensland between 1859 and 1959 and provide tangible evidence of their sustained contribution in volunteer-based groups to processes that build and shape communities over time. Collectively, however, these sites tend to strengthen the conservative view of women&#8217;s roles, in that they were associated with services which often reflected concerns about issues impacting on home and family. Groups pursuing social or political reform were also disadvantaged in that their sites were restricted in number and frequently limited to public space and bureaucratic or ministerial offices. Likewise, the efforts of Church-based groups were diffused, given their sites of association were, in many cases, not their own. As the first of its kind in a Queensland setting, this study provides substantive findings in an area not well served by scholarly researchers in the past. It also offers an alternative gender-sensitive approach to establishing links between women&#8217;s history and cultural heritage. In addition, it has the potential to lift the visibility of women&#8217;s voluntary work through landmark recognition and historic preservation programs, whether as new entries on heritage registers, additional information for existing listings, plaque placement or memorial programs and heritage trails.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women's voluntary work in Queensland and its place-based dimensions 1859-1959</field><field name="subject">Building communities and empowering experiences</field><field name="subject">Queensland cultural heritage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204876</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management in Malaysian five star hotels: Human resource practices system differentiation and its outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rozila Ahmad</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis explores the management of human resources (HR) in five star hotels located in a developing country (Malaysia). This study is particularly relevant to the hotel industry, known for its traditionally poor HR practices (e.g., a lack of employment security, training, and career development opportunity, low levels of employee involvement and an increasing number of casual employees who are paid hourly). These practices are often perceived as a solution to high labour costs and fluctuating demand prevalent in the hotel industry. However, it is often only "non-managerial" employees who are affected by poor HR practices, as more sophisticated approaches to HR practices are often taken with regard to managerial (strategic) level employees. HR practices system differentiation (HRPSD), or HR architecture, involves having more than one HR practices system within an organisation. HRPSD has been criticised in the hospitality management literature for the poor HR practices in the management of non-managerial employees, however despite this criticism, it is widely practiced by the industry. The continuation of HRPSD practices in the hotel industry suggests its importance to better understand, research and study. The aim of this research is to gain an understanding of HRPSD in a hotel industry context, and to better understand the immediate effects of such practices. While the existing literature concerning HR architecture in other industries provides some discussion of HRPSD, research and study of the concept focusing on the hotel industry is essential in providing a detailed explanation of the effect of this phenomenon, as HR practices between industries may vary. Central to this study, is an investigation of the nature of HRPSD, identification of HR intermediate outcomes, and the effects of HRPSD on hotel employees. Studying the effect of HRPSD on employees is important because employees are known to be a hotel organisations&#8223; most important resource. Developed based on the literature of SHRM and HR architecture, this study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates HRPSD in the SHRM model originally proposed by Schuler, Dowling, Smart, and Huber (1992). Guided by this model, this study seeks to answer the critical questions of &#8220;how organisations differentiate their HR practices systems&#8221; and &#8220;what are the corresponding HR intermediate outcomes?&#8221; A particular foci of this thesis relates to how the concept of a &#8220;strategic&#8221; (or managerial) job is conceptualised in the hotel industry, what the elements of HR practices systems in five-star hotels are, how and why hotel organisations differentiate their HR practices systems, what the HR intermediate outcomes of HRPSD are and how HRPSD relates to the identified HR intermediate outcomes. To answer these complex research issues, a multiple case research methodology is employed, utilising a series of in depth semi-structured interviews. This vi study focuses specifically on five-star hotels in Malaysia because HR practices vary among hotels of various sizes. The findings indicate a notable effect of HRPSD on employees&#8223; motivation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and retention, and that excessive differentiation is not beneficial for a five star hotel. In this study only certain HR practices were found to be differentiated; selective staffing, extensive training, compensation and empowerment. HR practices that were applied to all employees without differentiation were a clear job description, orientation, employment security, objective performance appraisal, career development opportunity and effective communication. In addition, this study also provides a clear definition of the strategic job in the hotel industry, and demonstrates the importance of HR practices integration and the influence of internal and external environments on the formation of HR strategy. This research contributes to theory as well as hotel sector policy and practice. Theoretically, it has identified how HRPSD links to firm performance (in Malaysian five star hotels). In addition, it provides clear definitions and understanding of the strategic job concept as well as identification of HR practices system elements and their differentiation in five-star hotels. Furthermore, the theoretical framework developed can be useful for future quantitative studies which can test the model formulated in this study. For practitioners, the detailed examination of HR practices system elements and how they are differentiated may guide them in their future HR strategy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel, strategy, human resource management, practices system, differentiation, intermediate outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205690</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facts, Fiction, Romance and Propaganda &#8211; The Complex Nature of the Sources for Alexander&#8217;s Subjugation of India</field><field name="creator">Michael Welch</field><field name="description">Abstract This dissertation demonstrates that the ancient source traditions which furnish historians with information concerning Alexander the Great&#8217;s subjugation of India are deeply complex and often underappreciated as being such. This is done through a systematic analysis of the various extant and fragmentary traditions surrounding this period. Therefore, the evidence of the authors who wrote about Alexander&#8217;s Indian campaign directly after, or within a generation or so of it, are first discussed. This involves primarily a study of the extant fragments of many of the men who accompanied Alexander himself. This is followed by an investigation into the so-called &#8216;secondary authors&#8217;, or our extant histories of Alexander. The focus here is on evaluating the transmission of detail, bias, and distortion through the various aims, methods and prejudices of these later historians. Following this, there is a discussion of the numismatic evidence relating to the Indian campaign. This involves a study of Alexander&#8217;s &#8216;elephant medallions&#8217; and various coins of the Diadochoi in which the intricacies of our documentary evidence is made evident. Finally, there is included in this dissertation a case study in which the problematic nature of the ancient evidence surrounding this period of the great conqueror&#8217;s life is shown. This is comprised of a detailed analysis of the evidence for the battle of the Hydaspes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Alexander the Great, India, Ancient Sources, Greek Historiography.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205788</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Healing architecture': A study of daylight in public hospital designs in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Srazali Aripin</field><field name="description">In the hospital building, where patients seek medical treatment and hospital staff provide continuous support, creating a healing environment is an imperative. However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion of the Concept of Sustainable Tourism Development: A Case Study on Kret Island, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Siriphen Dabphet</field><field name="description">Sustainable tourism development is widely accepted as an alternative approach to tourism development in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable in part to a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders&#8217; understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to destination stakeholders as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">sustainable tourism development, diffusion of innovation theory, communication channels, innovation characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208107</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tripartite model of anxiety and depression: A new look at theory and measurement</field><field name="creator">Boschen, M.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dr Alfred Jefferis Turner, 1861-1947 : his contribution to medicine in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thearle, M.

However, the single engine light aircraft cabin is still an extremely noisy environment, which apparently has been side-lined by both cost and weight constraints, especially with respect to low frequency sound reduction. Consequently, pilots and passengers of these aircraft are still exposed to potentially damaging noise levels and hearing damage can only be avoided by the proper use of ear defenders. Minimisation of the noise around the occupants of the aircraft reduces the dependency of personal ear defenders and is conducive to a more comfortable, hygienic and less stressful environment. This thesis describes the basis of a theoretical and experimental project, directed at the design and evaluation of a practical active noise control (ANC) system suitable for a single engine light aircraft. Results from initial experiments conducted in a single engine aircraft demonstrated the viability of ANC for this application. However, the extreme noise, the highly damped cabin, the multiple tone excitation, the severe weight limitations and the requirement of air worthiness certification severely complicated the problem of achieving noise reduction throughout the entire aircraft cabin. Compromising the objective to only achieving local control around the occupants still presented difficulties because the region of attenuated noise around the error sensors was so small that a nearby observer experienced no sound level reduction whatsoever. The objective was therefore to move the control zone away from the error sensor and place a broad envelope of noise reduction immediately around the occupant's head, through the use of virtual sensors , thus creating the perception of global noise control. While virtual sensors are not new (Garcia-Bonito et al. (1996)), they are currently limited to acoustic pressure estimation (virtual microphones) via the initial measurement of an observer / sensor transfer function. In this research, new virtual sensor algorithms have been developed to: 1. minimise the sound level at the observer location, 2. broaden the control region, 3. adapt to any physical system changes and 4. produce a control zone that may ultimately follow an observer's head The performance of the virtual sensors were evaluated both analytically and experimentally in progressively more complex environments to identify their capabilities and limitations. It was found that the use of virtual sensors would, in general, attenuate the noise at the observer location more effectively than when using conventional remotely placed error sensors. Such a control strategy was considered to be ideal for a light single engine aircraft, because it would only require small light speakers (possibly fitted into a head-rest) to achieve a broad control zone that envelopes the region around the occupants heads.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active noise control, noise control mathematical models, virtual sensors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37700</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dialogic learning in tutorial talk: a case study of semiotic mediation as a learning resource for second language international students.</field><field name="creator">Wake, Barbara Julienne.</field><field name="description">This thesis is a case study of dialogic learning in a university context as demonstrated in tutorial talk. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness or otherwise of dialogic learning as applied in an economics curriculum. More specifically, the thesis examines the learning experiences of a second language international student cohort as they attempted to understand the role of prediction and causality in economic principles and theories through spoken dialogue. This approach means interpreting the students&#8217; learning as a semiotic process and the students&#8217; cognitive development as shaped by their language in use. The theoretical framework for this examination is offered by the analytical resources of systemic functional linguistics, as developed by M.A.K. Halliday (from 1975 to 2004) combined with frameworks for mediated learning offered by Vygotsky (1986, 1987); Bakhtin (1986); Hasan (from 1985a to 2001); Bernstein (from 1971 to 2001) and Cloran (from 1994 to 2006 draft); and more recent research in &#8216;scaffolded learning&#8217;. The study applies these resources to analyse significant rhetorical functions of economic discourse, such as predictive reasoning and argumentation, and to examine how these were negotiated and mediated by the students and their lecturer. The method for analysing negotiation and mediation in these students&#8217; learning draws on Rhetorical Unit (RU) analysis as devised by Cloran. Linguistically, the analysis takes account of categories and relations between the Rhetorical Units on the basis that these are able to provide theoretical explanations for the predictive reasoning construed in the interactions. The analysis of Rhetorical Units primarily involved the identification of relations between the basic constituent of the text, ie, the message, and how these relations constructed the units of rhetorical meaning in the discussion. The advantage of adopting this approach is the possibility of realising rhetorical activities as an abstraction at the semantic stratum, and, as such, how they were realised by lexicogrammatical phenomena. The analysis examined: first, the use of Rhetorical Units by the lecturer and students in their construal of the critical pedagogic discourses identified by Bernstein, being the regulative and the instructional; and second, the adjustments and shifts to more congruent explanations as a result of contingency strategies taken by both the lecturer and students in response to the students&#8217; difficulties. The findings throw a different light onto dialogic learning in a new social constructivist pedagogical approach in a university context. The study reveals that while the students&#8217; learning was a highly collaborative dialectical process, any transformations in understanding were not at all neatly incremental as described in the literature. Indeed, the negotiations were highly &#8216;peripatetic&#8217;; any increments in understanding were overall devolutionary. While the lecturer&#8217;s initial guidance reflected the monologic discourse of written economics, her responses became more congruent and reactive. It was shown that a key predictor of these contingency strategies was the kinds of meanings sought by the students&#8217; extensive questioning. Hence, in this case study, the contingency strategies undertaken within the interactional dynamic reveal a different view of semiotic mediation, necessarily a process of semiotic remediation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer-group tutoring of students; English language - Study and teaching; Foreign study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40128</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A complex systems approach to important biological problems.</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Matthew John</field><field name="description">Complex systems are those which exhibit one or more of the following inter-related behaviours: 1. Nonlinear behaviour: the component parts do not act in linear ways, that is the superposition of the actions of the parts is not the output of the system. 2.

Self-organisation: order appears from the chaotic interactions of individuals and the rules they obey. 4.

They are often used as components in cinema sound systems where the sound can be broadcast evenly onto the audience at all frequencies, improving the listening experience. The sound distribution, or beamwidth, is related to the shape of the horn and is not predicted adequately by existing analytical horn models. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to develop a method to optimise the shape of the horn to give a specified beamwidth, which is ideally frequency independent, thus giving a high quality listening experience. This thesis begins with a thorough review of the literature relevant to modelling and optimising horn loaded loudspeakers. It gives an introduction to horn loaded loudspeakers, and describes traditional modelling approaches and their limitations. The applications of alternative modelling techniques to horn loaded loudspeakers, which have been found in the literature, are critiqued as are horn optimisation techniques. To examine the validity of the plane wave radiation assumption made by a number of horn models, experiments were undertaken to measure the sound field at the mouth of two small horns. These horns are representative of the size and design required for cinema loudspeaker systems, but are axisymmetric. The sound field was measured by an automated microphone traverse with almost 3500 measurements made across the face of each horn, providing a high spatial resolution. The results of the measurements showed that at low frequencies the sound fields from both the conical and exponential horns were similar and that above a certain frequency the sound field became more complex. An analysis of the data, using a modal decomposition with cylindrical duct modes of the same diameter as the mouth of the horns, revealed that almost all of the energy in the system existed in modes with no circumferential variation, and that above a certain limiting frequency, plane waves ceased to exist at the mouth of each horn. This work showed that any numerical model developed must be capable of efficiently modelling variations in the sound field across the mouth of the horn, and that models based on plane wave approximations should not be used for modelling these experimental horns, at least above a certain critical frequency. Numerical models able to accurately and quickly calculate the far field pressure from arbitrary shapes are also investigated. Calculations of the beamwidth from the analytical solutions for a 45? vibrating spherical cap, mounted on the surface of a unit sphere, were compared with those obtained from an implementation of the direct Boundary Element Method (BEM) and a source superposition technique. The investigation found excellent agreement between these results for mesh densities of 6 elements per wavelength, the generally recommended minimum mesh density for BEM simulations. The source superposition technique was significantly faster than the direct BEM for comparable accuracy in the far field. There was also excellent agreement between analytical calculations and all of the numerical methods for a mesh density of 3 elements per wavelength. This is a significant finding as it allows a reduction in mesh density, and hence matrix size and solution time, for a given accuracy of far field solution. Alternatively, higher frequencies can be reached for a given mesh density. It was also found that the source superposition technique produced matrices that are highly diagonally dominant, and well suited to fast iterative solution techniques. The validation of the numerical methods for modelling the beamwidth of horn loaded loudspeakers was undertaken by comparing the source superposition technique to experiment, as well as with an alternative numerical method, the direct BEM. It was shown that such models are capable of modelling the sound field generated by a horn loaded loudspeaker from a specification of the horn geometry. This accuracy of the model is adequate for design purposes within the given frequency range. Both the direct BEM and the source superposition technique are capable of modelling the experimental beamwidth; however, the source superposition technique is considerably faster and hence more suitable for use in optimisation techniques. During the literature review, a type of sonar transducer called a Constant Beamwidth Transducer (CBT) was found that was able to produce an easily specified frequency independent beamwidth. These are desirable characteristics for the design of a horn. The concept used in the development of these transducers, a specified velocity profile over the surface of a sphere, is explored in this thesis in relation to horn design. A semi-analytical technique, using solutions to the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates and numerical integration of Legendre functions, was developed to efficiently calculate the beamwidth for an arbitrary velocity profile over the surface of a sphere. It was used to calculate the beamwidth for four different velocity profiles: a spherical cap mounted on the surface of a sphere; a CBT profile; and two smooth tailed CBT velocity profiles. The results showed that the smooth tailed CBT velocity profiles produce the smoothest beamwidth, possibly at the expense of low frequency performance. It was also found that the performance of each velocity profile is consistent with CBT theory, with the best performing profile having the highest rate of energy decay in the spherical Legendre modes. CBT theory also suggests that the performance of the CBT transducers is unaffected by the removal of the inactive part of the sphere, i.e. that part over which the velocity profile is zero. This was confirmed numerically by simulations using the source superposition technique. The numerical model developed to investigate the CBT was used to test robust optimisation techniques suitable for optimising horn loaded loudspeakers. Two different objective functions were considered, one that uses least squares to drive the velocity profile to a minimum, and the other that uses a constrained optimisation of a smoothness parameter. It was found that constrained optimisation was able to robustly find an optimal solution in an acceptable number of objective function evaluations. As the cost of evaluating the objective function for horn loaded loudspeakers is high, the potential of surrogate modelling techniques, designed to reduce the overall number of objective function evaluations, was investigated. Optimal solutions were found for two different parameterisations of the velocity profile. One parameterisation was similar to the smooth tailed CBT velocity profiles and the other, which allowed a more variable velocity profile, was defined by B&#40617;er curves. The idea of CBT theory, that is, defining an optimal velocity profile over a spherical cap, was applied to the optimisation of horn loaded loudspeakers. A number of different horn geometry parameterisations were developed, with the aim of producing an optimal velocity profile over the mouth of the horn. The robust optimisation techniques developed previously were applied, and an optimal horn geometry calculated. It was found that a very simple geometry parameterisation could produce near constant beamwidth performance while keeping the desired design (or nominal) beamwidth, and that a more complicated parameterisation (using splines) could not keep the nominal beamwidth but provided superior constant beamwidth performance. A series of optimisations using the spline parameterisation were undertaken to map the design space, with the result being a design chart for constant beamwidth horns. The desired performance characteristics of a constant beamwidth horn such as length, mouth to throat ratio or nominal beamwidth can be specified, and the horn performance and specifications easily read from a chart. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop fast and reliable optimisation techniques for horn loaded loudspeakers to achieve a robust horn design method for cinema loudspeakers. This thesis achieved this aim for axisymmetric horn geometries by: developing fast and well validated numerical methods for calculating the beamwidth of horn loaded loudspeakers; by examining how optimal beamwidth control is achieved in CBTs, and how this can be achieved in horn loaded loudspeakers; by developing robust objective functions and optimisation techniques capable of finding an optimal beamwidth from a parameterised geometry; and by developing a design chart for constant beamwidth horns.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Loudspeakers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal spatially fixed and moving virtual sensing algorithms for local active noise control.</field><field name="creator">Petersen, Cornelis D.</field><field name="description">Local active noise control systems aim to create zones of quiet at specific locations within a sound field. The created zones of quiet generally tend to be small, especially for higher frequencies, and are usually centred at the error sensors. For an observer to experience significant reductions in the noise, the error sensors therefore have to be placed relatively close to an observer&#8217;s ears, which is not always feasible or convenient. Virtual sensing methods have been proposed to overcome these problems that have limited the scope of successful local active noise control applications. These methods require non-intrusive sensors that are placed remotely from the desired locations of maximum attenuation. These non-intrusive sensors are used to provide an estimate of the sound pressures at these locations, which can then be minimised by a local active noise control system. This effectively moves the zones of quiet away from the physical locations of the transducers to the desired locations of maximum attenuation, such as a person&#8217;s ears. A number of virtual sensing algorithms have been proposed previously. The difference between these algorithms is the structure that is assumed to compute an estimate of the virtual error signals. The question now arises as to whether there is an optimal structure that can be used to solve the virtual sensing problem, which amounts to a linear estimation problem. It is well-known that the Kalman filter provides an optimal structure for solving such problems. An optimal solution to the virtual sensing problem is therefore derived in this thesis using Kalman filtering theory. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an acoustic duct arrangement to demonstrate its effectiveness. The presented experimental results indicate that the zone of quiet was effectively moved away from the physical sensor towards the desired location of maximum attenuation. The previously proposed virtual sensing algorithms have been developed with the aim to create zones of quiet at virtual locations that are assumed spatially fixed within the sound field. Because an observer is very likely to move their head, the desiredlocations of the zones of quiet are generally moving through the sound field rather than being spatially fixed. For effective control, a local active noise control system incorporating a virtual sensing method thus has to be able to create moving zones of quiet that track the observer&#8217;s ears. A moving virtual sensing method is therefore developed in this thesis that can be used to estimate the error signals at virtual locations that are moving through the sound field. It is shown that an optimal solution to the moving virtual sensing problem can be derived using Kalman filtering theory. A practical implementation of the developed algorithm is combined with an adaptive feedforward control algorithm and implemented on an acoustic duct arrangement. The presented experimental results illustrate that a narrowband moving zone of quiet that tracks the desired location of maximum attenuation has successfully been created.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise control.</field><field name="subject">Kalman filtering.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47788</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the interdisciplinary requirements of 3D geological models.</field><field name="creator">Riordan, Sarah J.</field><field name="description">Despite increasing computer power, the requirement to upscale 3D geological models for dynamic reservoir simulation purposes is likely to remain in many commercial environments. This study established that there is a relationship between sandbody size, cell size and changes to predictions of reservoir production as grids are upscaled. The concept of a cell width to sandbody width ratio (CSWR) was developed to allow the comparison of changes in reservoir performance as grids are upscaled. A case study of the Flounder Field in the Gippsland Basin resulted in the interpretation of three depositional environments in the intra-Latrobe reservoir interval. The sandbody dimensions associated with these depositional environments were used to build a series of 3D geological models. These were upscaled vertically and horizontally to numerous grid cell sizes. Results from over 1400 dynamic models indicate that if the CSWR is kept below 0.3 there will be a strong correlation between the average production from the upscaled grids compared to those of a much finer grid, and there will be less than 10% variation in average total field production. If the CSWR is between 0.3 and 1, there could be up to 30% difference, and once the CSWR exceeds 1.0 there is only a weak relationship between the results from upscaled grids and those of finer grids. As grids are upscaled the morphology of bodies in facies models changes, the distribution of petrophysical properties is attenuated and the structure is smoothed. All these factors result in a simplification of the fluid flow pathways through a model. Significant loss of morphology occurs when cells are upscaled to more than a half the width of the reservoir body being modelled. A simple rule of thumb is established &#8212; if the geological features of a model cannot be recognised when looking at a layer in the upscaled grid, the properties of the upscaled grid are unlikely to be similar to those of the original grid and the predictions of dynamic models may vary significantly from those of a finer grid. This understanding of the influence of sandbody size on the behaviour of upscaled dynamic models can be used in the planning stages of a reservoir modelling project. Two simple charts have been created. The first chart is for calculating the approximate number of cells in a model before it is built. The second chart is for comparing the proposed cell size against the CWSR, so that the predicted discrepancy between the ultimate production from the upscaled grid and one with much smaller cells can be assessed. These two charts enhance discussion between all interested disciplines regarding the potential dimensions of both static and upscaled dynamic models during the planning stage of a modelling project, and how that may influence the results of dynamic modelling.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flounder Field; Gippsland Basin; facies model; 3D reservoir characterisation upscaling; grid cell size</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60066</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solidarity?: A comparative study of trades unions in the conscription debate in New Zealand and Australia during the Great War.</field><field name="creator">Pearce, Robert Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis is a comparative study of trades unions in the conscription debate in Australia and New Zealand during the Great War. The governments of Australia and New Zealand looked to conscription to maintain the supply of men in the war effort. However, when they declared conscription for overseas service was necessary, most unions opposed it, although some unions in both countries were divided over the issue.  New Zealand&#8217;s unions fought for the repeal of the Military Service Act, which compelled men between the ages of 20 and 46 years to register for overseas military service. Australian unions fought for the defeat of two plebiscites conducted by the government of the day regarding the invocation of conscription. Several factors influenced unions to oppose conscription. Through the use of trades union and government archival material, particularly minutes of meetings, correspondence, annual reports, conference minutes, diary entries, government documents, pamphlets, biographies, union and contemporary newspapers, it is possible to establish why unions took their stance. In this thesis the factors that shaped the stance of unions on conscription are presented; including the circumstances of the formation of unions, their early history and influences, and their attitudes to compulsory military training. Evidence is also presented regarding the relationship between the union movement and the government of each country, and it is posited that these relationships were influential in the outcome of the conscription debate in the respective countries. Unions in both countries campaigned vigorously to stop conscription. Only in Australia were they successful.   When war was declared in 1914, unionists from both countries balanced union beliefs against other factors. Unionists were concerned that this war was a class war, incorporating inequality of sacrifice. Unionists were also concerned about provisions for families of those serving, the cost of living and loss of civil liberties; none of which were addressed by the governments of the day in the opinion of unionists. Unionists feared economic and industrial conscription. Other unionists simply lacked a belief in war and opposed it. Unionists, in general, opposed the manufacture of war materials. However, this war was also considered to be a necessary evil. Opposition to conscription was counter-balanced with patriotism and belief in the evil of Germany, with the result that many unionists enlisted voluntarily for overseas service. When conscription became the issue, unionists in both countries opposed it. The New Zealand government legislated for a Military Service Act which the unions attempted to have repealed, but in Australia the government held two plebiscites on conscription to determine the wishes of the populace. Both were defeated, the unions claiming victory.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trades unions; conscription; New Zealand; Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60393</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Orthodontic tooth movement and neurotrophins in the rat dento-alveolar complex.</field><field name="creator">Moses, James</field><field name="description">During orthodontic tooth movement, stress is applied on the dento-alveolar complex, initiating a biological response. This response results in the remodelling of the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone. When a force is placed on a tooth, the periodontal ligament is stretched and compressed depending on the direction of force. On the side where the ligament is stretched, a response resulting in bone deposition is initiated. On the opposite side, where the periodontal ligament is compressed, a response resulting in the resorption of bone begins. These responses are believed to be modulated by factors that are derived from the immune or nervous systems. When stress is placed on the periodontal ligament, it is believed that nerve fibres and neuroreceptors within the tissue are distorted, leading to the release of neurotrophins and a common concomitant clinical response of pain and pressure. These neurotrophins may interact with cells within the dentoalveolar complex, including fibroblasts, endothelial and alveolar bone cells, resulting in the initiation of bone resorption via the activation of intracellular secondary messengers, which leads to cellular proliferation and differentiation. Neurotrophin levels may play a role in the modulation of cellular activity in the periodontal ligament during orthodontic movement. They are a family of protein polypeptides which are important in neural cell differentiation and survival. One relatively well studied member of the family, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), is a polypeptide essential for supporting cholinergic innervation in the brain and sympathetic and sensory innervation in the peripheral tissues. Within the dento-alveolar complex, the function and localization of neurotrophins and their receptors are yet to be determined. Previous studies have shown that there is an increase in NGF expression in tissues in response to injury, suggesting that NGF expression may increase in regions within the dento-alveolar complex where inflammation and bone remodelling are occurring. A study showed elevated levels of NGF mRNA in human periodontal ligament cells in vitro during increased transcription and translation of the bone-related proteins alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin, suggesting NGF facilitates bone formation. The NGF may be modulating cellular activity within the periodontal ligament. O&#8217;Hara et al. used immunohistochemical staining in the rat dento-alveolar complex to show that there was evidence of an increase in NGF synthesis and release by certain cells or tissues within the region of alveolar bone remodelling during the initial injury response period to orthodontic tooth movement. Ho used a similar model to test the hypothesis that there may be a positive relationship between the presence of osteoclasts and pre-osteoclasts with areas of NGF localisation. He found no relationship between osteoclasts and areas of NGF; however, his findings showed areas of unknown tissue within the periodontal ligament that were associated with NGF. To date, the relationship between NGF and the cellular process of orthodontic tooth movement remains unknown. Further studies are required to describe the distribution of neurotrophins and neurotrophic receptors and cellular interactions within the rat dento-alveolar complex.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthodontics; neurotrophins; CGRP; tooth movement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60433</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of growth factors on the osteoinductive potential of Hydroxyapatite &#946;-Tricalcium Phosphate (HA-TCP).</field><field name="creator">Chan, Raymond Chun Wai</field><field name="description">The replacement of missing teeth by osseointegrated dental implants is a commonly utilised treatment option in dentistry. However, successful treatment outcomes are dependent on sufficient bone quantity in the proposed surgical site for implant placement (Buser et al., 2004). Surgical augmentation of bone defects is commonly performed prior to or during implant placement. Bone augmentation procedures of the maxillary sinus or guided bone regeneration (GBR) procedures of alveolar ridge defects have utilised a variety of bone graft materials in block or particulate form, either alone or in combination with resorbable or non-resorbable barrier membranes. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether Hydroxyapatite &#946;-Tricalcium Phosphate (HA-TCP) either alone or combined with Enamel Matrix Derivative (EMD) or recombinant human Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) is osteoinductive when implanted into a nonosseous site. Methods: Twenty CD-1 adult male mice underwent intramuscular implantation into both hindlimbs of an empty gelatine capsule or a gelatine capsule containing one of the following: 10 mg of uncoated particulate HA-TCP, (Straumann Bone Ceramic&#174;, HA-TCP), EMD coated HA-TCP, (Emdogain&#174;, HATCP + EMD) or rhPDGF-BB coated HA-TCP (HA-TCP + PDGF). Ten animals were sacrificed at four and eight weeks with five specimens from each group retrieved at each time point. The area of graft placement was radiographed and after graft retrieval, a semi-quantitative histological examination was performed with the aim of assessing the inflammatory changes, reparative processes and osteoinduction within the graft site. Results: At both 4 and 8 weeks, histological analysis failed to demonstrate any osteoinductive activity in any of the specimens from the three experimental groups. A minimal chronic inflammatory response and foreign body reaction was seen in the experimental groups which reduced over time. The particles were embedded within fibrous connective tissue and were encapsulated by a dense cellular layer consisting of active fibroblasts and occasional macrophages with the thickness of this layer decreasing over time. At 4 weeks, a greater density of the fibrous connective tissue was demonstrated in the HA-TCP + EMD group (P&lt;0.001) while a greater thickness in the capsule thickness was seen in the HA-TCP group (P=0.022) although no differences were seen after 8 weeks. Greater neovascularisation was seen in the HA-TCP + PDGF group after 8 weeks (P=0.043) while greater amounts of adipose tissue surrounding the particles were detected in the HA-TCP + PDGF group at 4 weeks (P=0.002) and in the HA-TCP + EMD group at eight weeks (P=0.002). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the use of commercially available HA-TCP alone or in combination with EMD or rhPDGF-BB is biocompatible but not osteoinductive in the murine model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">osteoinduction; growth factors; bone graft; enamel matrix proteins; platelet derived growth factor; biphasic calcium phosphate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60434</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic effects of general anaesthetics : a suite of clinical studies and theoretical models</field><field name="creator">Sleigh, James Wallace</field><field name="description">The primary object of this thesis was to investigate aspects of empirically-measured, anaesthesia-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that could be explained by network models of cortical interactions. The thesis consists of a collection of various theoretical and clinical papers in three sections: (a) A background section summarizing previous relevant published works on the molecular actions of anaesthetic agents, and the origin and problems with the acquisition of the EEG. (b) A second section dealing with the development of various theoretical / computer models of general anaesthetic action. (c) A third section of various clinical and EEG studies of anaesthesia and sleep. These were done to confirm and clarify some of the theoretical results from the models. However there are many different ways of numerically capturing the information contained within the EEG. Because this problem needed to be overcome before the primary aim of the thesis could be accurately handled; the clinical studies tended to be diverted into this secondary "signal-acquisition" aspect of the EEG analysis in anaesthesia and sleep. Because the thesis has a constellation of different interlocking threads of investigation, I have summarized the various themes in the following table. (A) Background Section The relevant conclusions from the background section were: 1) The transition from aesthesia to anaesthesia involved the whole animal, and thus may not be entirely measurable by the EEG. In contrast the transitions from consciousness to coma - and even more specifically - from mnesis to amnesis were predominantly observable by changes in the activity of the cortex and in the resultant EEG signal. 2) The EEG signal arose largely from the summation of coherent post-synaptic potentials in the cortical pyramidal cells. These were, in turn, mainly controlled by cortical layer-l modulation - which was subject to ascending neuromodulatory systems. 3) The main artifacts in the EEG signal were eye-movements, blinks, and frontalis EMG. 4) The Bispectral index (BIS) consisted of three subcomponents. The first two (BetaRatio and SynchFastSlow) probably reflected the loss of high-frequency activity that is associated with the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness. 5) The state of the midbrain reticular formation projecting via the non-specific thalamocortical connections can profoundly alter the oscillatory state of the cortex and thence the EEG. Direct or indirect actions of general anaesthetic agents on these structures may be a major cause of the observed EEG changes. These changes are qualitatively similar to the changes observed during natural sleep. 6) Although there was variation between different agents, the most consistent action of commonly-used general anaesthetic agents was to prolong the fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential&gt; 50% by GABAergic potentiation. This action was consonant with the observed EEG effects of anaesthesia - which are (1) an increase in EEG spectral power and frequency followed by, (2) a decrease in dominant frequency and overall power with increasing concentrations: the so-called "biphasic response" There were also a number of more specific features: namely loss of alpha band activity, an initial increase in relative beta activity, followed by a shift to lower frequencies, spindles - and in deep anaesthesia - burst suppression patterns. Other contributions to anaesthetic action may include: (1) inhibition of NMDA receptor function, (2) reduction of nicotinic acetylcholine modulation, and (3) a direct hyperpolarizing action by opening potassium channels. Anaesthetic agents disrupted cortical function at lower doses than those required for inhibition of brain stem function. (B) Theoretical Models The fact that the cerebral cortex consisted of, effectively, a two-dimensional interconnecting neural network was of overriding importance. All the theoretical models were constrained by this topological fact, and showed a remarkable degree of similarity. Regardless of whether the model was continuous (appendix 2) or discrete (cellular automata), some robust and consistent features emerged: 1) Some form of abrupt decrease in information flow within the network occurred when the interaction between the network elements was interrupted greater than certain critical threshold amount - the order/disorder phase transition. 2) This critical point was manifest as (i) a large change in the simulated mean soma potential (the order parameter), (ii) divergence of the spectral power of the simulated pseudoEEG signal, and (iii) decrease in frequency content (in the cellular automaton models). Unfortunately the order parameter for the EEG is probably unmeasurable in clinical practice. The first derivative is measurable, but not completely reliable as a proxy order parameter. 3) All models required some form of noisy external (subcortical) input to drive them. Variations in this input could explain some of the anomalies observed in the clinical section of the thesis. (C) Clinical Papers The clinical papers were a series of papers recording the clinical data, which then influenced the development of the theoretical models. The single most popular clinical measure of anaesthetic depth in present practice is the Bispectral Index (BIS). Many of these studies explore the strengths and weaknesses of this index in various clinical situations. The main disadvantage of the BIS was that crucial aspects of its formulation are not in the public domain for commercial reasons. We attempted to separate out the changes in the various subcomponents of the BIS in patients under general anaesthesia, and natural sleep. 1) In the first paper we described how the EEG changed during induction and recovery from general anaesthesia with propofol and isoflurane. We compared EEG vs heart rate variability changes as monitors of anaesthetic depth. This study served to evaluate a clinically accepted measure of anaesthetic depth, as well as gaining practical EEG experience in collecting experimental data, both using the ASPECT EEG monitor, and in devising the best clinical methods of quantifying levels of consciousness. The main results were that the BIS was relatively reliable in steady-state conditions, and better than the raw 95% spectral edge frequency, and the approximate entropy of the EEG. 2) Auditory recall and response-to-command during recovery from propofol anaesthesia. In this paper we were able to collect data in a very controlled situation, somewhat different from that pertaining to clinical practice. From this we were able to identify separate components of consciousness and mnesis and how they correlated with EEG changes. We were also able to compare frontal and parietal EEG data. We established that there is a clear divergence of spectral power around the time of loss-of-consciousness when the propofol was administered as a slow infusion. This is good evidence supporting the basis of the theoretical models. This experiment also established that it is possible for a patient to be conscious, not paralyzed, but not responding to verbal command. 3) Electroencephalographic measures of depth of anaesthesia: the importance of the gamma band and the electromyogram signal. This study was concerned with different technical aspects of EEG signal acquisition and processing. It suggested that usually the EMG is not a significant problem, and that the gamma (40-60Hz) frequency band is important in distinguishing the awake from the anaesthetized state. 4) The Bispectral Index: A Measure of Depth of Sleep? Because the EEG changes of general anaesthesia are very similar to those of sleep, this study was a simple observational study collecting some information about changes in the BIS with natural sleep. 5) The Bispectral Index and Sleep Stage: A Polysomnographic study. In this study we formally compared the BIS with a full polysomnogramnographic sleep staging. It confirmed the results of the previous study, and demonstrated that the subcomponents of the BIS (the BetaRatio and the SynchFastSlow) changed in a manner very similar to those observed under general anaesthetic. Conclusions The observed changes in the EEG on induction of anaesthesia can be explained by changes in relatively simple theoretical network models. These changes can be reliably reduced to univariate Parameters</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposure of ewes to stressors in mid- and late- pregnancy : postnatal effects on the ewe and lamb : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Corner, Rene Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to examine the effect of maternal undernutrition and exposure to stressors between pregnancy day 50 to 100 and 100 to 147 of pregnancy on the ewe and her lamb. The long-term effects of these stressors during pregnancy on lamb growth, plasma cortisol response to a stressor, metabolism, behaviour and future reproductive success were examined. Mid-pregnancy shearing The component of mid-pregnancy shearing that causes the increase in lamb birth weight is unknown. It was hypothesised that the increase in lamb birth weight was due to the stress response of the ewe to shearing. This work examined the effect of a range of stressors at approximately day 80 of pregnancy. These stressors included yarding, crutching and sham-shearing that may be components of the shearing procedure that produce a stress response. In addition, repeated stressors between day 74 and 106 of pregnancy including isolation, sham-shearing and exogenous cortisol injection were used to examine the role of a longer-term stress response on lamb birth weight. Mid-pregnancy shearing has consistently resulted in an increase in lamb birth weight, however all the other stressors investigated had no effect. Therefore, the hormonal stress response of ewes to shearing was unlikely to be the cause of the increase in lamb birth weight. Mid-pregnancy shearing also resulted in minor changes in ewe and lamb behaviour 12 to 24 h after birth. Shearing during pregnancy had no effect on the cortisol response of ram lambs to handling or castration however differences were observed between singleton- and twin-born lambs. Ewe nutrition during pregnancy Ewes mildly undernourished in between days 70 and 107 of pregnancy that were then provided with adequate nutrition between days 108-145 of pregnancy gave birth to lambs with similar birth weights as ewes well-fed during both periods. Therefore the effects of undernutrition on lamb birth weight can be minimised if undernutrition can be limited to the earlier period (day 70-107 and 108-147 of pregnancy). Mild undernutrition in both periods (day 70 &#8211; 145 of pregnancy), resulted in lambs that were lighter and that exhibited behaviours associated with a greater &#8216;drive&#8217; to maintain contact with their dam than lambs born to ewes well-fed during the same period. This suggests that even mild undernutrition in both mid- and late- pregnancy should be avoided. The effect of maternal nutrition and lamb litter size on the behaviour of female offspring was examined at 1 and 2 years of age. Litter size had no effect on ewe behaviour at 1 year of age however at 2 years of age twin-born ewes had higher maternal behaviour scores than triplet-born ewe lambs. Nutrition of the maternal grand dam during pregnancy had only a minor effect on the behaviour of female offspring at 1 year of age and no effect on maternal behaviour at 2 years of age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Long-term effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300404 Animal husbandry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/763</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand.

In many cases the individuals that are selected for reintroduction are harvested from &#8216;mammal-free&#8217; offshore islands. This thesis examines the effects of isolation from mammalian predators on the predator avoidance behaviours and predator recognition abilities of New Zealand birds using the North Island robin as a model. It also investigates whether any effects of isolation from mammalian predators has a lasting impact on mainland populations founded by individuals from offshore islands. Nest site selection behaviours were compared across three populations that are exposed to different suites of predators and have differing translocation histories; Benneydale, Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm. Point height intercept and point-centred quarter surveys were used to compare habitat availability between the sites and to compare nest sites with the available habitat. Eight nest characteristic variables were also compared across the three sites using a principle component analysis. Benneydale nests were located higher in the trees and were more concealed than nests at the other two sites. Nests on Tiritiri Matangi were supported by large numbers of thin branches and were located toward the periphery of the nest tree. Unfortunately these differences are very difficult to interpret due to a high degree of variation in the habitat types present at the three sites. The anti-predator behaviours initiated in response to a model stoat, model morepork and control were used to test the ability of nesting robins to recognise the threat that each of these treatments might pose to nest success. Behavioural variables were compared between Benneydale, Tiritiri Matangi and Wenderholm using a response intensity scoring system and a principle component analysis. The results indicated that isolation from mammalian predators on Tiritiri Matangi has suppressed the ability of robins on the island to recognise the predatory threat posed by a stoat. They also suggest that the intense mammal control carried out at Wenderholm may have inhibited the ability of local robins to produce strong anti-predator responses when faced with a stoat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">predator recognition</field><field name="subject">predatory threats</field><field name="subject">island bird sanctuaries</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1142</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of music therapy on self-reported affect in hospitalised paediatric patients : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music Therapy</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Ruth Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The present research examines the effect of music therapy on the affect of hospitalised children.

Literature on the impact of hospitalisation, and on the use of music therapy in hospitals and paediatrics was reviewed. The research involved an audit of the therapist&#8217;s clinical notes from music therapy sessions over the course of seven months.

Statistical analysis of the facial scale data did not show a significant difference between &#8216;before&#8217; and &#8216;after&#8217; measures. These results were discussed with regard to a ceiling effect (this is, the measurements indicated patients were at the happy end of the scale before the music therapy session, so there was little room on the scale for mood to improve following music therapy). The measurement of emotion did not prove to be straightforward. The hospital environment may have influenced the patients&#8217; responses in a number of ways. These environmental influences are discussed with reference to examples from the clinical notes. The usefulness of facial scales in this context is discussed, as well as other limitations of the research. Suggestions for future research include the use of other mood measures, and the inclusion of measurements of parental mood and how this affects the child.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy for children</field><field name="subject">children hospital care psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1208</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metaphors of menopause in medicine : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Niland, Patricia Ruth</field><field name="description">Medical textbooks have previously represented women&#8217;s bodies and menopause life transitions by using notions of &#8216;machine productivity&#8217; and &#8216;machine breakdown&#8217; (Martin, 1987). This study aimed to explore whether these representations have changed, especially given recent HRT clinical trial results. Eight relevant compulsory medical textbooks for first and second year medical students at two New Zealand Universities were identified. A Foucauldian discourse analysis (Parker, 1990) was undertaken on relevant content to identify representations of menopause, HRT, women&#8217;s bodies, and ageing. Five major discourses were employed in the textbooks in descriptions of menopause and HRT: failure, estrogen deficiency as disease; HRT as saviour; obscurity and the new discovery discourse. Menopause continues to be represented as resulting from a &#8216;failure&#8217; of a machine-like body. Although the recent HRT clinical trials were reported as a serious risk factor in half of the textbooks, HRT was also represented as a saviour particularly against postmenopausal osteoporosis. The discovery of &#8216;new&#8217; drugs to &#8216;treat&#8217; HRT and the &#8216;postmenopausal&#8217; patient were heralded with much excitement. Medical textbooks continue to use failure discourses to describe women&#8217;s bodies at menopause. New risk-based HRT assessments for &#8216;patients&#8217; with menopause &#8216;symptoms&#8217; are promoted. These portrayals reinforce linear and reductionist ways of thinking about menopause and women at midlife and provide few spaces for resistance or alternative constructions to more accurately reflect women&#8217;s embodied worlds.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Menopause</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Health psychology</field><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1338</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing the local : a case study of the use of markets and strategic performance measurement systems in a local authority in New Zealand : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Accountancy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Nyamori, Robert Ochoki</field><field name="description">This study seeks to illuminate how markets and private sector managerial practices, especially strategic performance measurement systems (SPMS) have come to be a central part of the government of the local domain and with what effects, following far-reaching reforms to the New Zealand public sector commencing in the mid 1980s. The study uses Michel Foucault's concept of governmentality to interpret the way people are governed through regimes of practice that present certain ways of being as true and others as false, utilising traditional devices of sovereignty and discipline, as well as technologies of the self. Parliamentary bills to reform New Zealand local government were analysed as was the literature on local government reform. These illuminated the rationalities and technologies underpinning the reforms. Literature on strategic planning and management in the public sector were analysed to provide insights into the discursive formation of SPMS as a technology of government. The researcher also interviewed the city manager, managers of all the units, some non-managerial staff, The Mayor and one councillor of Future City Council The pseudonym has been adopted for purposes of confidentiality.(FCC), a New Zealand local authority. He also collected and analysed numerous internal documents from the case study. The analysis involved a transcription of all interviews and then identification of common themes from among the interviewees. The individual interviewee's response to a theme were analysed against that of other interviewees and the internal documents so as compare their interpretation of the introduction and effects of markets and SPMS. The results of this analysis were then interpreted employing the concept of governmentality. The aim was to establish the extent to which this concept could explain the changes to local government and their effects. The reforms to local government in New Zealand were driven by the same rationalities as those of the larger New Zealand public sector, namely, efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. The study found that these rationalities were associated with regimes of practice that sought to constitute citizen and staff as autonomous entities that could govern themselves, while at the same time gazing over each other. These practices included the separation of policy making from management, commercial operations from non-commercial ones, business from non-business departments and the introduction of competition through internal markets. These changes were associated with discourses that promoted citizens as active participants in their communities but who were at the same time autonomous individuals who could take care of themselves and who had the rights of consumers. These dividing practices sought to change the nature of the relationship between staff and citizens, supplanting trust with technologies of mistrust, enabling government without obvious intrusion hence overcoming the dialectic between control and freedom that is the hallmark of advanced liberal societies. These rationalities were also associated with SPMS programmes and technologies that sought to reconfigure local spaces into communities bounded by local authorities. Since annual planning and the long-term financial strategy required consultation with their communities, citizens were interpellated into their own government. Consultation and citizen participation enabled the needs and aspirations of these communities to be known to staff of the FCC who would be expected to work towards their fulfilment. These needs and aspirations in turn became the basis for programmes of governing the conduct of the staff and elected representatives of the FCC. SPMS incited citizens to evaluate the FCC and various facets of their lives on the basis of the logic of the economic, which became the vehicle and basis for far- reaching changes to the FCC. These practices enabled FCC individual staff's work to be delineated into objectives, to which they were assigned. This in turn enabled the individual performance of staff to be calculable, measurable and visible hence tying their daily working lives with the rationalities of government. The dreams of reformers however, do not always accord with practice, as was evident at the FCC. The changes while embraced by some were resisted by others, who though subsequently defining the organisation in terms of strategy and markets, do not appear to have been overwhelmed by it. This study hopefully contributes to accounting research in a number of ways. While the bulk of Foucaultian studies are historical, this study combines both historical and contemporary analysis of the evolution and instantiation of a discourse of markets and private sector managerialism. The study is able to show how the subject constitutes and is constituted by a discourse of community, customer and enterprise, contrary to previous studies that have relied on the study of discourse as an intermediary to the subject. The study extended previous by show how the subject is not a mere pawn of discourse, but is able to appropriate and resist discourses that contradict his or her prior identities. The study also shows the potentially rich insights, which can be gleaned from looking at accounting as part of the larger modalities for governing organisational and social life. It shows how accounting data and personnel are appropriated by staff in various units to develop and interpret strategy and measure its progress within the organisation. Importantly, accounting logic is used to link individual work with the political rationalities of strategic planning. The researcher hopes that a healthy debate would ensue regarding the reasons, means and effects of neo-liberal modes of government in the local sphere.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Local government</field><field name="subject">Strategic management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1623</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subject child : the everyday experiences of a group of small town Aotearoa/New Zealand children : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology, Social Policy and Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Jacqueline Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an ethnographic account of everyday life for eighteen healthy and safe, small town, Aotearoa/New Zealand children aged between ten and eleven years. It undertakes a social constructionist analysis of five domains of the children's lives; self and identity, their relationships with each other, their relationships with adults, time and space, and safety and risk. These domains reflect the intersection between the children's own lives and their wider contexts. The approach taken is consistent with the new social studies of childhood perspective that has been articulated over the past 15-20 years. This approach, developed in response to a perceived over-determinism in the developmental accounts of childhood, brings to the foreground the need to document more fully children's standpoints. The children held a sense of themselves as good people and their thoughts about the future, relationships and themes of stability were prominent areas of self-development for them. Their friendships provided important social and emotional resources. Making and sustaining friendships involved delicate processes of positioning and while they provided emotional sustenance they could also be a source of confusion and anxiety. Intense friendships were important for both boys and girls. Relationships with adults were critical and time was an important component of good relationships. The children thought about time in a variety of ways, but the linear progression of time from the present out to the future was not a strong component of this. Home was important place to the children, home as stability, as a place for time with parents and for free time were prominent themes. It was also a place of self-care for a number of the children. School time was experienced as time to play with friends and socialise, and schoolwork time. Social time was more prominent in the children's thinking than work time. Global discourses about risk and safety played a powerful role in influencing the ways in which the children spent their time, particularly the ways in which they utilised public spaces. The children were keen to participate in the research and were insightful social commentators demonstrating a passionate interest in being able to express their views and to think about the way that different dimensions of their social worlds influenced the things they were able to do.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand children</field><field name="subject">Childhood</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370500 Demography::370504 Family and household studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1624</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The linear wave response of a single and a periodic line-array of floating elastic plates: a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wang, Cynthia Dewi</field><field name="description">We propose an improved technique to calculate the linear response of a single and multiple plates models due to ocean waves. The single plate model is the basis for the multiple plates model which we take to be a periodic array of identical plates. For the single plate model we solve the plate displacement by the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the water potential by the Boundary Element Method (BEM). The displacement is expanded in terms of the basis functions of the FEM. The boundary integral equation representing the potential is approximated by these basis functions. The resulting integral operator involving the free-surface Green's function is solved using an elementary integration scheme. Results are presented for the single plate model. We then use the same technique to solve for the periodic array of plates problem because the single and the periodic array plates model differ only in the expression of the Green's function. For the periodic array plate model the boundary integral equation for the potential involves a periodic Green's function which can be obtained by taking an infinite sum of the free-surface Green's function for the single plate model. The solution for the periodic array plate is derived in the same way as the single plate model. From this solution we then calculate the waves scattered by this periodic array.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plates model</field><field name="subject">Finite element method</field><field name="subject">Boundary element method</field><field name="subject">Green's function</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1625</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The x-linked LSP1&#945; gene of Drosophila Melanogster is not acetylated by MOF, but is sex-specifically regulated by individual components of the MSL complex  : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Weake, Vikki Marie</field><field name="description">Male Drosophila melanogaster double the transcription of most of the genes on their single X chromosome, to equal that from the two female X chromosomes, in a process termed dosage compensation. This process is mediated by the MSL complex, consisting of both protein and non-coding RNA components. This complex is only active in males due to the presence of MSL2, which is not translated in females. The X-linked Lsp1&#945; gene of Drosophila melanogaster appears to escape dosage compensation, and exhibits two-fold higher levels of expression in females compared to males. The apparent lack of dosage compensation of Lsp1&#945; could be due to the promoter being more active in females than in males, or to a lack of regulation by the MSL complex. In this study, the mechanism by which this happens has been addressed. Lsp1&#945; is expressed exclusively in the fat body tissue of third instar larvae, and forms part of a multi-protein complex that acts as a nutrient reservoir during pupariation. In this study it has been shown that transgenes, in which the reporter gene, lacZ, is under the control of the Lsp1&#945; promoter, exhibit variable levels of increased activity in female compared to male third instar larvae. At high levels of transgene expression, activity of the transgene is equal in female and male larvae. When the expression of the transgene is low, the activity of the transgene is much higher in female compared to male larvae. This increased sensitivity of the Lsp1&#945; promoter to position effects in females appears to be mediated by one or more components of the MSL complex. Females ectopically expressing MSL2 exhibit decreased levels of transgene activity. Furthermore, overexpression of MSL1 causes an increase in the activity of transgenes subject to strong position effects. Despite these findings, the sex-specific regulation of the Lsp1&#945; promoter does not account for the non-dosage compensated appearance of Lsp1&#945;. Instead, unlike control dosage compensated X-linked genes, Lsp1&#945; is not enriched for a histone modification, acetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4 that is essential for dosage compensation by the MSL complex. The developmental stage at which the four genes flanking Lsp1&#945; are expressed has been determined using northern RNA hybridization. Expression of the gene immediately 3' of Lsp1&#945; could not be detected at any developmental stage using northern RNA hybridization or in adults by RT-PCR. However, the two genes flanking Lsp1&#945; are expressed in equal levels in male and female Drosophila as determined by quantitative RNase protection analysis. Furthermore, the regions between Lsp1&#945; and these flanking dosage compensated genes do not prevent dosage compensation of an X-linked armlacZ reporter gene. Bioinformatic analysis shows that Lsp1&#945; is present in three species closely related to D. melanogaster but is absent in more distantly related species. It is probable that because of its recent evolutionary origin, the Lsp1&#945; gene lacks the DNA sequences that are required to attract the MSL complex. More generally, a model is proposed in which dosage compensation involves binding of the MSL complex to DNA sequences in actively transcribed regions with possible limited spreading to closely associated active genes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fruit fly genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1626</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors.

One is about the accuracy of the poverty measures calculated by the concerned organisations and this relates to the use of equivalence scales and the general style of analysis. The other more intricate question is the disregard for poverty due to intra-family distribution asymmetries. Such miscalculations of poverty arise due use of average household per capita expenditure to represent consumption. This research attempts to answer the question of whether the tendency to underestimate the incidence of poverty by disregarding intra-family inequality is significant. Furthermore, it attempts to determine the causes of these inequalities. The issue is whether the classical method of data analysis (using the family as a unit) is the ideal way of analysing poverty and distribution in societies where large family structures exist and government relief remains minimal. To determine the household inequalities, household expenditures have been disaggregated into individualised expenditures. The individualised consumption expenditure is analysed and compared with the outcomes of aggregate household expenditure data. The analysis provides overwhelming evidence for underestimation of poverty when household consumption expenditures are used.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="subject">Intra-household Inequality; Inequality Indices; Poverty; Poverty Measurement; Poverty indices, poverty lines, household incomes; household expenditures, household surveys, absolute poverty and relative poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:163266</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

It is exported to Japan, China, Korea and the United States for the sushi and sashimi markets. The primary purpose of SBT farming in SA is to fatten wild-caught juvenile fish (2-4 years of age with initial mean weights between 12-20 kg) over a period of approximately five months by feeding a selection of baitfish types. Farmers, farm managers and consumers of SBT all have an interest in managing chemical residues that have the potential to biomagnify in the fatty tissue of the farmed SBT fillets. Of particular interest are chemical residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins / dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This research presents the investigations and experimental validation of a predictive model that can be used to address the levels of residues in the fillets of farmed SBT at harvest from feeding (as the source) when applied to SBT aquaculture. An additional industry-focussed aim of this research was to determine if a Longer Term Holding (LTH) farming period, with a duration of an extra 12 months after a typical farming period of approximately five months, could produce SBT with higher condition index (CI) and lipid content, while keeping levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs low, compared to the typical farming period. The justification for this research is that an adequate quantitative model is essential to help industry achieve targeted concentrations in the final fillet product by making scientific-based decisions on baitfish selection (baitfish strategies for the feeding of SBT), and longer term, to confidently demonstrate to local markets and importing countries that Australia is actively managing levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in farmed SBT, to ensure a high quality and safe product is delivered to the consumer. The novelty of this research is underpinned by four integrated stages, and the criteria for an adequate model established. The important criteria included: accurate predictions versus observed data demonstrated through the analysis of residual plots, potential physiological interpretation of model coefficients, parsimony &#8211; the model should be as simple as possible (but no simpler) and that the model should be easy to use. Firstly, a logical starting point was the development of a risk framework for residues in SBT. The developed framework was based on conventional principles of microbiological risk assessment highlighted in Codex Alimentarius. The risk framework consists of five governing principles: hazard identification, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment, risk characterisation and model validation. The advantages of the risk framework is that it provides a systematic research approach and permits information to be handled unambiguously, especially important for the niche SBT industry where chemical residue research is carried out for the first time. Secondly, because of a lack of available scientific data in context of this research, commercial-scale experimental field data for levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in typical farmed SBT as affected by feeding and growth were collected over 17 months at seven time intervals from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd in 2005/06 (n = 50). Field data from another commercial company, Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd, was collected over the typical farming period specific to this company, spanning 15 weeks at three time intervals in 2006, for validation work (n = 15). The data obtained from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd revealed that whole weight of farmed SBT increased from 18.5 kg to 30.3 kg for a typical farming period, and subsequently to 41.0 kg by the end of the LTH farming period. A maximum mean CI of 24.0 &#177; 0.5 kg.m&#8315;&#179; and a maximum mean lipid content of 17.6 &#177; 0.5% was achieved at the third time interval of the typical farming period, for the baitfish types and ratios used as feed. There were no significant differences in the CI and lipid between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods, i.e. even after an additional 12 months of farming. PCB and PCDD/F concentrations, however, increased between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods. The data indicated that a typical farming period was sufficient to achieve a maximum CI and lipid content with lower concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in the fillets relative to the LTH farming period. For the third stage of this research, a quantitative model was synthesised and applied to the PCB and PCDD/F (2,3,7,8-TeCDF) data detected in farmed SBT fillets. Assimilation efficiencies for PCBs and 2,3,7,8-TeCDF in the fillets of SBT were obtained. An assimilation efficiency, or percentage retention (efficiency expressed as a percentage), in the fillet of SBT is a measure of the uptake of a chemical residue from food (baitfish) to the SBT fillet. For the WHO-PCBs, assimilation efficiencies based on SBT fillets ranged between 19.1 &#8211; 35.3 % with the exception of PCB 169. The highest assimilation efficiency of 35.3 %, with a range of 30.4 &#8211; 40.3 % (at the 95 % confidence level) was attributed to the most toxic PCB congener, PCB 126. An assimilation efficiency of 39.2 % was determined in SBT fillets for the congener 2,3,7,8-TeCDF, which was higher than the assimilation efficiencies determined for the WHO-PCB congeners. A residual plot as predicted value versus observed value indicated that the predictive model was neither under- or over-parameterised. However, when the predictive model was assessed against the data set from Farm Alpha Pty Ltd, the model over-predicted the actual PCB and PCDD/F concentrations. The over-prediction is attributed to possible overfeeding of SBT farmed by Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd. From a food safety point of view, in the absence of ideal predictions because of a lack of ideal validation data sets, an over-prediction instead of under-prediction is preferred. In the fourth stage, the practical application of the predictive model was demonstrated. Because SBT fillets are retailed as tissue group-specific, i.e. akami (low fat), chu-toro (medium fat) and otoro (high fat) fillets, PCB and PCDD/F analyses were carried out on the three tissue groups for selected SBT (n = 7). Dietary modelling on SBT consumption in humans was carried out using findings from the predictive model and tissue-specific data. The baitfish strategy employed for the feeding of farmed SBT consequently affects dietary exposure to SBT consumers. Exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is approximately seven times lower for the consumption of a skin-free, boneless akami fillet than for a comparable otoro fillet of the same size. This dietary exposure assessment accounted only for consumption of SBT tissue-specific fillets. The experimental field study and modelling work on PCB and PCDD/F concentrations in farmed SBT (fillets) outlined in this thesis importantly directs the need to re-evaluate a specific model to better cater for SBT farming practices where SBT fillets are produced for human consumption. Because conditions that normally pertain to commercial farming of wild-caught fish were studied, findings should be of interest to industries where other species of fish (for food) are farmed in sea-cages in the open ocean.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical residues; fish; Southern Bluefin Tuna; predictive modelling; PCBs; PCDD/Fs; bipheyls; dioxins; biomagnification model</field><field name="subject">Bluefin tuna Australia</field><field name="subject">Bluefin tuna fisheries Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58572</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semilinear stochastic differential equations with applications to forward interest rate models.</field><field name="creator">Mark, Kevin</field><field name="description">In this thesis we use techniques from white noise analysis to study solutions of semilinear stochastic differential equations in a Hilbert space H: {dX[subscript]t = (AX[subscript]t + F(t,X[subscript]t)) dt + &#417;(t,X[subscript]t) &#948;B[subscript]t, t&#8712; (0,T], X[subscript]0 = &#958;, where A is a generator of either a C[subscript]0-semigroup or an n-times integrated semigroup, and B is a cylindrical Wiener process.

OSA is more common in males and the obese but the reasons why remain poorly understood. Abdominal obesity, particularly common in males, is likely to indirectly modulate the amount of tension (tracheal traction) exerted on the UA by the trachea and other intrathoracic structures, potentially leading to increased UA collapsibility. Other factors such as lung volume changes with obesity, altered drive to UA muscles and exaggerated arousal responses are also likely to contribute to UA instability. An investigation of these potential contributing factors forms the basis of this thesis. In the first study, the effect of external abdominal compression on UA collapsibility during sleep was investigated in a group of obese male OSA patients. A large pneumatic cuff wrapped around the abdomen was inflated to increase intra-abdominal pressure, aiming to produce an upward force on the diaphragm, designed to reduce axial tension on the UA. Abdominal compression increased end-expiratory gastric (PGA) and end-expiratory transdiaphragmatic (PDI) pressure by ~50% and produced a significant rise in UA collapsibility compared to the cuff deflated condition. These data support that increased intra-abdominal pressure has a negative effect on UA function during sleep. This effect may help explain why obesity is the leading risk factor for OSA and why OSA affects men more than women, given that abdominal obesity is particularly common in obese males. In the second study, differences in minimum expiratory (tonic) diaphragm activity during wakefulness were compared between 8 obese OSA patients and 8 healthyweight controls. Changes in tonic diaphragm activity and lung volume following sleep onset were also compared between the two groups. There was no evidence of increased tonic diaphragmatic activity during wakefulness in obese OSA patients to support significant diaphragmatic compensation for abdominal compressive effects of obesity. There were small decrements in lung volume following sleep onset in both groups (&lt;70 ml), with significantly greater lung volume and diaphragmatic EMG decrements when sleep onsets were immediately followed by respiratory events. While lung volume decrements at sleep onset were relatively small, this does not discount that UA function is not more sensitive to effects of reduced lung volume in obese OSA patients. To more closely investigate the potential interactive effects of obesity on physiological variables likely influencing UA function, the third study investigated the temporal relationships between a comprehensive range of relevant physiological variables leading into and following the termination of obstructive apnoeas during sleep in 6 obese OSA patients. Prior to UA obstruction, diaphragm and genioglossus muscle activity decreased, while UA resistance increased. Lung volume and end-expiratory PGA and end-expiratory PDI also fell during this period, consistent with diaphragm ascent. There was a substantial increase in ventilation, muscle activity and lung volume immediately following the termination of obstructive events. Respiratory events and arousals occurred in close temporal proximity prior to and following obstructive apnoeas, supporting that cyclical respiratory events and arousals may both help to perpetuate further events. The results from this study support that there is a &#8216;global&#8217; loss in respiratory drive to UA dilator and pump muscles precipitating obstructive respiratory events. The associated decreases in UA dilator muscle activity and lung volume may therefore both contribute to the propensity for the UA to obstruct. In summary, increased intra-abdominal pressure was shown to negatively impact UA airway collapsibility during sleep. A decrease in lung volume at sleep onset and prior to UA obstruction further support that lung volume decrement, coincident with a decline in overall respiratory drive, potentially contributes to the propensity for airway obstruction. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relative contribution of relatively small changes in lung volume versus changes in respiratory and UA muscle activity per se on UA patency in OSA patients.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obstructive sleep apnoea; obesity; lung volume; genioglossus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60527</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three essays on consumer search behavior in experimental market environments.</field><field name="creator">Ke, Changxia</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates consumer search behavior in different contexts and its implications on certain market outcomes. It consists of three self-contained essays. Part one investigates if people search optimally and how price promotions (such as the provision of price discounts) influence search intensity and risk-taking behavior. We start with a typical sequential search task in a finite time horizon (with exogenously determined price dispersion) as the baseline treatment. In the two experimental treatments, exogenous discounts are introduced to the search process. The treatments differ in the amount of information on the discounts revealed to the subjects. Subjects&#8217; search behavior is roughly consistent with optimality for a risk-neutral agent, but significantly influenced by the introduction of discount vouchers. We find that subjects&#8217; search intensity is significantly reduced if they are in a shop that offers discounts, even when the monetary benefit induced by the discount has been taken into account. This suggests that people seem to gain extra non-monetary utility from buying a discounted product. Alternatively, subjects might overestimate the value of a discount. Following the findings in part one, we focus on price-framing effects of discounts on consumer search behavior in part two. In order to isolate the price-framing effect from all other possible influences, we adopt an extremely simple two-shop search model in which a consumer who sees the price for an item in a shop has to decide either to buy it or to incur a search cost to learn the ex-ante uncertain price in a second shop. The experiment is designed such that a rational buyer should make identical decisions in the base treatment (where prices are posted as net prices in both shops) and in the experimental treatments (where the price in one of the shops is framed as a gross price with a discount, holding the net-price constant). Using structural estimation of the observed risk preferences, we find that people tend to be more risk-averse and hence buy from the initial shop more often in the discount treatments, regardless of where the discount is offered. The seemingly trivial change to a discount-framing increases the complexity of the decision problem. Subjects reveal a tendency to stick with the comparatively less complex options more frequently as the complexity of the decision problem increases. However, this bias declines with experience, as subjects become more and more familiar with the framing. In part three, we study search behavior in a market experiment, where prices are determined endogenously by human players. More specifically, we examine the behavioral factors and the underlying mechanism which drive the widely observed asymmetric price adjustment to cost shocks (in a world with costly search behavior and information asymmetry). We show that price dispersion, as well as asymmetric price adjustment to cost shocks, arises in experimental markets, even though the standard theory predicts neither. We find that after controlling all the potential theoretical factors, the observed price dispersion can be explained by the presence of bounded rational play. Under price dispersion, asymmetric price adjustment arises naturally, as it is harder for buyers to learn that a negative cost shock has taken place. Learning is much quicker after a positive shock.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer search theory; price promotion; price dispersion; information asymmetry; asymmetric price adjustment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60528</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular dynamics study of flow regimes with effects of wall properties in 2-D nano-couette flows.</field><field name="creator">To, David</field><field name="description">The transitional Reynolds number and range for macrochannel flows are around 1200 and 1000 respectively. Several studies have shown that for microchannel flows, the transitional Reynolds number drops to around 500 and the transitional range around 300. This thesis provides some data on the laminar to turbulent transition for nano-channel flows through molecular dynamic simulations. The Lennard-Jones potential is used for fluid-fluid and wall-fluid interactions, and a non-linear spring potential is used for wall-wall interactions. The mixing is characterised by averaging the maximum transverse movement for all fluid molecules. Six nano-separations were simulated and the flow and mixing behaviours examined. The results show that the transitional Reynolds number and the range increase with increasing diameter. The effects of wall properties on flow regimes were also investigated using molecular dynamic simulations. The results show that the transitional Reynolds number and range increased with increasing wall density. For increasing wall interaction strength, the effect on the transitional Reynolds number was inconclusive. However, the transitional range increased. With an increase in wall wettability, which corresponds to an increase in hydrophilicity, there was an increase in both the transition Reynolds number and range. The wall roughness was modeled as sinusoidal. For an increase in the amplitude of the wall roughness, there was a decrease in the transitional Reynolds number. The effect on the transitional range was inconclusive. For an increase in the period of the wall roughness, both the transitional Reynolds number and range increased. Errors involved in MD simulations arise from several sources. They include the size of the time-step, thermostat model, wall model, and viscosity calculation method. No experimental results at the nano-scale are available for direct comparison however they provide a basis for future work. As computation power improves, MD simulations at higher Reynolds numbers may be compared with experimental results of flows through microchannels. Also, as laboratory technology and measurement accuracy improves, experimental results of flows through nano-channels may be conducted and used for comparison.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molecular dynamics; flow regimes; wall properties; couette</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60529</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities, market transformation and firm performance.</field><field name="creator">Liao, Tung-Shan</field><field name="description">The emergence of the dynamic capabilities view has essentially extended the resource-based view, while also providing an integrated framework for an understanding of how firms evolve and how they secure competitive advantage in rapidly changing environments. While much research into dynamic capabilities has been developed in the theoretical and qualitative arenas, there has of yet been limited empirical support for its core assumptions. Such a limitation, authors have noted, may be due to its equivocal framework and the lack of a model with specified antecedents. This research conducts both conceptual and empirical works to address this gap. The primary goal of the research is to clarify the conceptual structure of dynamic capabilities, while also investigating potential micro-foundations of dynamic capabilities and their influences on firm performance. These micro-foundations, as the research traces back to the origins of dynamic capability from much firm capability and strategic management literature, could potentially include innovation, processual formalisation, social integration platforms (i.e. employee training and education) and the application of information technology. Alternatively, the research also looks into a possible extension of the dynamic capabilities view by extending inter-firm activities. In this part, the exploratory focus is on the relationship between a firm&#8217;s intended actions and its employment of alliance portfolios for capability and resource development. Using a subsample in the Australian manufacturing SME sector (from the Business Longitudinal Survey), the research finds a significant mediating effect of market transformation on the inter-relationships within the nexus of dynamic capabilities and firm performance. The empirical evidence of the research suggests that a firm&#8217;s dynamic capabilities are able to be viewed as a driver of competitive performance of firms insofar as they become evident in marketplaces. In other words, a firm&#8217;s development of dynamic capabilities confers upon the firm an adaptive capability in response to, or indeed perceiving, market dynamics, which in turn leads to superior performance. For the issue of inter-firm capability development, the research also finds that a firm&#8217;s capability development is indeed able to be achieved through some potential inter-firm specific activities. The empirical findings suggest that, for a purpose of capability development, alliance portfolios employed by a firm are able to be viewed as an approach to filling its resource stock or exploiting a perceived opportunity in its operational and strategic environments. In addition to the provision of empirical evidence, the research also extends the discussion of capability development by utilising a contextual case discussion in Taiwan&#8217;s ICT industry. Comparing strategy adoptions between OBM and OEM/ODM from Taiwan&#8217;s ICT businesses, the research reveals that many firms&#8217; long-term and successful path dependencies that are absent the mediating arrangements discussed above may in fact form an obstacle to financial performance and growth into new business locales.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovation; dynamic capabilities; training; organisational processed; alliance portfolios</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60530</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soft tissue attachment to titanium implants coated with growth factors.</field><field name="creator">Bates, Christopher William</field><field name="description">The process of osseointegration described by Br&#229;nemark (Br&#229;nemark et al 1969, 1977) and Schroeder (Schroeder et al 1981) plays an integral role in dental rehabilitation. Since the first observation 40 years ago, osseointegrated titanium implants have been used predictably in the dental rehabilitation of fully edentulous patients. The application of dental implants has evolved, and from the 1980s dental implants have been used increasingly in the treatment of partially edentulous patients, with equal or better long-term success (Buser et al 1990, 1997, Lekholm et al 1994, Behneke et al 2000, Bornstein et al 2005). The surgical procedures for the placement of endosseous dental implants are based on the original work by Br&#229;nemark and colleagues approximately 40 years ago. The two-stage surgical procedure was originally advocated to obtain an optimal process of new bone formation and remodelling after implant placement (Br&#229;nemark et al 1977). Osseointegration and good long-term success was also found to be achievable with non-submerged implants (Buser et al 1990, 1992, 1997, Ericsson et al 1997) with the added advantage of avoiding a second surgical procedure (Buser et al 1999). Implant dentistry has evolved over the last 15 years and has benefited from significant progress made in associated treatment protocols and the development of bone augmentation procedures (guided bone regeneration (GBR) and sinus floor elevation) allowing for correction of alveolar bone deficiencies. Additionally, improved osteophilic microtextured implant surfaces have been developed to accelerate healing, significantly reducing treatment time. Research and clinical focus in dental implantology in the last two decades has primarily concentrated on the bone-to-implant interface of osseointegrated implants. The soft tissue profile and seal around implants have been investigated to a much lesser degree. This interest has been largely due to the fact that a successfully osseointegrated implant depends on anchorage in bone and requires a direct bone-to-implant interface to provide long-term support for a prosthesis. Both bone and soft tissue integration onto dental implants are wound healing processes whereby several stages of tissue formation and degradation are involved (Berglundh et al 2003, Abrahamsson et al 2004). Osseointegration is the result of the modelling and remodelling of bone tissue that occurs after implant placement whilst the wound healing that occurs following the closure of mucoperiosteal flaps during implant surgery results in the establishment of a mucosal attachment (transmucosal attachment) to the implant. The establishment of the mucosal barrier around the implant is characterised by the gradual shift from a coagulum to granulation tissue followed by the formation of a barrier epithelium and the maturation of the connective tissue (Berglundh et al 2007). Like natural teeth, osseointegrated implants are transmucosal &#8220;masticatory devices&#8221; that penetrate the oral mucosa with the periodontal and peri-implant tissues expected to perform a protective function (Weber &amp; Cochran 1998). Background: Peri-implant tissues form a crucial but fragile seal between the oral environment, the bone and the implant surface. Enhancing the seal formed by the peri-implant soft tissues at the titanium/connective tissue interface may be an important factor in implant survival. Additionally, enhancing soft tissue adherence to the implant surface when implants are placed in dehiscence type defects may mean that simultaneous osseous grafting procedures will not always be required. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of implant surface modification with either platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) or enamel matrix derivative (EMD) on the connective tissue attachment to moderately roughened titanium implants. Material and Methods: 18 moderately roughened titanium implants were subcutaneously implanted into 14 rats. 6 implants each were coated with PDGF and EMD immediately prior to implantation and 6 implants were left uncoated. The implants were retrieved with a sample of surrounding tissue at 4 and 8 weeks. The specimens were resin-embedded and sections viewed under confocal microscopy for collagen autofluorescence and prepared for qualitative and histomorphometric analysis under light microscopy. ANOVA and t-tests were used to compare the thickness of fibroblast encapsulation on the implant surface and the depth of connective tissue penetration onto the implant grooves. Results: Qualitative analysis under confocal and light microscopy showed encapsulation of all implants by fibroblasts and good soft tissue integration at the end of 4 and 8 weeks. Coating of the implants with growth factors did not alter the orientation of fibroblasts and collagen fibres. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that the depth of connective tissue penetration into the implant grooves was significantly greater for the implants coated with PDGF at 4 weeks (ANOVA, P value 0.0014). The thickness of the fibroblast encapsulation on the implant surface was significantly less for the implants coated with PDGF at 8 weeks (ANOVA, P value 0.0012). Conclusion: Good soft tissue integration can be achieved on a moderately roughened titanium implant surface. Coating the implant surface with rhPDGF-BB could increase the speed of soft tissue healing around an implant surface but this increased rate of healing with rhPDGF-BB coating could also result in a less robust titanium/connective tissue interface.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dental implants; peri-implant tissues; enamel matrix derivative; platelet-derived growth factor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60531</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bayesian networks for high-dimensional data with complex mean structure.</field><field name="creator">Kasza, Jessica Eleonore</field><field name="description">In a microarray experiment, it is expected that there will be correlations between the expression levels of different genes under study. These correlation structures are of great interest from both biological and statistical points of view. From a biological perspective, the identification of correlation structures can lead to an understanding of genetic pathways involving several genes, while the statistical interest, and the emphasis of this thesis, lies in the development of statistical methods to identify such structures. However, the data arising from microarray studies is typically very high-dimensional, with an order of magnitude more genes being considered than there are samples of each gene. This leads to difficulties in the estimation of the dependence structure of all genes under study. Graphical models and Bayesian networks are often used in these situations, providing flexible frameworks in which dependence structures for high-dimensional data sets can be considered. The current methods for the estimation of dependence structures for high-dimensional data sets typically assume the presence of independent and identically distributed samples of gene expression values. However, often the data available will have a complex mean structure and additional components of variance. Given such data, the application of methods that assume independent and identically distributed samples may result in incorrect biological conclusions being drawn. In this thesis, methods for the estimation of Bayesian networks for gene expression data sets that contain additional complexities are developed and implemented. The focus is on the development of score metrics that take account of these complexities for use in conjunction with score-based methods for the estimation of Bayesian networks, in particular the High-dimensional Bayesian Covariance Selection algorithm. The necessary theory relating to Gaussian graphical models and Bayesian networks is reviewed, as are the methods currently available for the estimation of dependence structures for high-dimensional data sets consisting of independent and identically distributed samples. Score metrics for the estimation of Bayesian networks when data sets are not independent and identically distributed are then developed and explored, and the utility and necessity of these metrics is demonstrated. Finally, the developed metrics are applied to a data set consisting of samples of grape genes taken from several different vineyards.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayesian networks; genetic regulatory networks; complex mean structure; high dimensional data</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60532</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on image change detection methods for multiple images of the same scene acquired by a mobile camera.</field><field name="creator">Tanjung, Guntur</field><field name="description">Detecting regions of change while reducing unimportant changes in multiple outdoor images of the same scene containing fence wires (i.e., a chain-link mesh fence) acquired by a mobile camera from slightly different viewing positions, angles and at different times is a very difficult problem. Regions of change include appearing of new objects and/or disappearing of old objects behind fence wires, breaches in the integrity of fence wires and attached objects in front of fence wires. Unimportant changes are mainly caused by camera movement, considerable background clutter, illumination variation, tiny sizes of fence wires and non-uniform illumination that occurs across fence wires. There are several issues that arise from these kinds of multiple outdoor images. The issues are: (1) parallax (the apparent displacement of an object as seen from two different positions that are not on a line with the object) among objects in the scene, (2) changing in size of same objects as a result of camera movement in forward or backward direction, (3) background clutter of outdoor scenes, (4) thinness of fence wires and (5) significant illumination variation that occurs in outdoor scenes and across fence wires. In this dissertation, an automated change detection method is proposed for these kinds of multiple outdoor images. The change detection method is composed of two distinct modules, which are a module for detecting object presence and/or absence behind fence wires and another module for detecting breaches in the integrity of fence wires and/or attached objects in front of fence wires. The first module consist of five main steps: (1) automated image registration, (2) confidence map image production by the Zitnick and Kanade algorithm, (3) occlusion map image generation, (4) significant or unimportant changes decision by the first hybrid decision-making system and (5) false positives reduction by the template subtraction approach. The second module integrates: (1) the Sobel edge detector combined with an adaptive thresholding technique in extracting edges of fence wires, (2) an area-based measuring in separating small and big objects based on their average areas determined once in the calibration process and (3) the second hybrid decision-making system in classifying objects as significant or unimportant changes. Experimental results demonstrate that the change detection method can identify and indicate approximate locations and possible percentages of significant changes whilst reducing unimportant changes in these kinds of multiple outdoor images. The study has utilized occluded regions in a confidence map image produced by the Zitnick and Kanade algorithm as potential significant changes in the image change detection research. Moreover, the study proves that the use of the Sobel edge detector combined with an adaptive thresholding technique is applicable in extracting edges of outdoor fence wires. In the future, the method could be integrated into patrol robots in order to provide assistance to human guards in protecting outdoor perimeter security.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image change detection; image registration; fuzzy inferance system; surveillance and security; adaptive thresholding; edge detection; mobile camera</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60533</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictors of response to adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer.</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Michelle Liza</field><field name="description">Background: It is well recognized that not all patients with stage C colorectal cancer (CRC) derive a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. It would therefore be advantageous to identify factors that define a target group for treatment. It has been suggested that those most likely to benefit are women with proximal tumours. Recent work has suggested microsatellite instability (MSI) may be a useful marker however the limited studies performed are conflicting. Aim: To determine if gender, site, tumour histology or microsatellite (MSI) status predict survival benefit from 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy in stage C CRC. Method: Data was collated on stage C colorectal cancer cases that underwent curative resection over a 20-year period (inclusive of years prior to standard chemotherapy). Pathology was re-evaluated, DNA extracted from the formalin fixed paraffin specimen and MSI status established. Primary endpoint was cancer-related death. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for univariate analysis and differences analysed by log rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for age, gender, site, distinct pathological variables and MSI. A compounding effect between these factors and chemotherapy benefit was measured by interaction testing Results: 811 unselected cases were included in the study. Thirty-seven percent received chemotherapy. Chemotherapy significant improved cancer-specific survival (HR of dying 0.66 (95% CI 0.52-0.83 p=0.0003). Female gender offered a survival advantage overall (HR 0.81 95% CI 0.68-0.97; p=0.02) however site did not influence outcome (HR 1.03). On interaction testing, gender, site and tumour histology did not significantly influence the survival effect of chemotherapy. 802 cases were included in the MSI analysis of which 77 exhibited MSI. MSI status did not influence prognosis (HR of cancer death 1.45, 95% CI 0.90-2.21; p= 0.13). However, in the non-chemotherapy cohort, MSI conferred a significantly less favourable outcome (HR 1.89, 95%CI 1.13-3.16; p= 0.02). Chemotherapy produced a survival benefit in both the MSI (HR 0.08 95% CI 0.02-0.27; p=&lt;0.0001) and the microsatellite stable (MSS) cohort (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81; p=0.001). On interaction testing, neither compounded the benefit of chemotherapy, however of all the tested parameters, MSI came closest to significance (p=0.08). Conclusion: These results suggest that 5FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy for stage C colorectal cannot be targeted using gender, tumour site, histological characteristics or MSI.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemotheraphy; prognosis; colorectal; colon; rectum cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological, biochemical and molecular characterisation of hydroxycinnamic acid catabolism by Dekkera and Brettanomyces yeasts.</field><field name="creator">Harris, Victoria</field><field name="description">Dekkera and the closely related Brettanomyces are important yeasts in food and beverage production in part due to the metabolism of hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs).

The results provide a comprehensive overview of HCA metabolism and volatile product formation for these genera. Furthermore, results have been confirmed in a semidefined wine medium that more closely resembled the physio-chemical parameters found in the typical wine environment. The enzymes responsible for the metabolism of HCAs were examined in Dekkera and Brettanomyces. Dekkera yeasts are known to enzymatically convert HCAs into vinylphenols (VPs) and ethylphenols (EPs). These products are indicative of Dekkera contamination. The first enzyme in the two-step HCA &#9472; VP &#9472; EP biochemical pathway is a hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase (HCD). This enzyme has been previously characterised from a single Dekkera strain. The second enzyme, vinylphenol reductase (VPR) has never been isolated or characterised from any microorganism. In order to further elucidate the HCA &#9472; VP &#9472; EP pathway, cell extracts were prepared from all five Dekkera and Brettanomyces spp. to evaluate activity against HCAs and VPs. Brettanomyces spp. were unable to metabolise HCAs indicating that these yeast do not have a functional HCD enzyme. Both Dekkera spp. have substrate inducible HCD activity. Temperature and pH optima were 40&#186;C and 5.75-6.00, respectively. The active protein was purified from cell extracts of D. anomala CBS 77 and a partial sequence was obtained. 3&#8217;RACE PCR was performed and a near complete gene sequence determined. This sequence does not have homology to HCA decarboxylase enzymes previously characterised from yeasts and bacteria and thus may represent a novel enzyme not previously described. Biochemical characterisation of the vinylphenol reductase (VPR) enzyme was also undertaken. VPR activity was found for all 5 Dekkera and Brettanomyces spp. Activity was greatest at pH 6 and between 40-50&#186;C and was induced by both VPs and HCAs. Data obtained during growth experiments indicated that HCAs, and in particular ferulic acid, inhibited the growth of Dekkera and Brettanomyces spp. On this basis a more detailed study was carried out to determine the concentrations required to prevent growth in various media. In a modified red wine a concentration 0.1 mM ferulic acid inhibited growth and 2 mM prevented cultures of both D. anomala and D. bruxellensis from becoming established even when re-inoculated into to a fresh HCA-free medium. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that ferulic acid caused physical damage to Dekkera cells upon exposure. This work could lead to the development of an alternative method for the control of Dekkera in wine or other food products.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dekkera; Brettanomyces; wine; spoilage; PAD; VPR; HCA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60535</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One Hundred Years of Slavery: A Sociohistorical and Demographic Study of the Origins of Cayenne Creole</field><field name="creator">Jennings, William</field><field name="description">This thesis takes a new approach to the study of the genesis of the lexically-French based Cayenne Creole, which emerged in French Guiana around the beginning of the eighteenth century.  The study begins with an an overview of theories of creole genesis that describes the various schools of thought, notably the diffusionist, superstratist, substratist and universalist positions.  Part 2 of the thesis examines the social history of Cayenne from 1650 to 1750.  It provides information about the various early settlements of Cayenne Island, particularly the Dutch and Portugese Jewish establishment from 1654 to 1664 that saw the beginning of large-scale African enslavement in the colony.  The development of the slave community in the context of the French colony is examined in detail, particularly with respect to the conditions of the slaves and their origins.  Part 3 deals with the demography of Cayenne from 1650 to 1750.  It features a detailed analysis of colonial censuses during this time, and looks at the 1690 slave list of Goupy des Marets in great detail.  The origin of the slave ships to Cayenne is also discussed.  Finally, Part 4 draws on the information provided in the social history and demography to suggest a model for the genesis of Cayenne Creole.  The validity of this model will be tested in future linguistic studies of Cayenne Creole.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/911</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Instructor attention to oral reading errors: a functional analysis</field><field name="creator">McNaughton, Stuart, 1950</field><field name="description">The effect of attention to oral reading errors has received little specific examination by researchers in applied behaviour analysis. Some data suggest attending to such errors can have inappropriate effects on learning. A conceptual framework was developed to examine the effects of error attention on the acquisition of proficient reading responses. Analyses of reading behaviour employed concepts and data from 'structural' accounts of reading. These concepts provided details of the components of response systems. Acquisition of proficient reading was seen to involve trends towards accurate integrated responding which becomes self controlled. Error attention was conceptualised as having motivational and informational properties which could directly affect acquisition trends. The first experiment (Chapter Three) demonstrated that under appropriate conditions oral reading behaviour was facilitated by error attention. Eleven year old readers in a Learning Disabilities classroom were measured in their usual reading setting. Two readers received extra tutoring with error attention procedures. A further two readers acted as a contrast for the effects of increased opportunities to respond. These readers received extra practice tutoring with minimum levels of praise. A third subject received no extra tutoring during the course of the experiment. Results indicated that both practice and error attention produced substantial increases in accuracy and correct rates. Accuracy levels were higher for error attention subjects suggesting error attention can have important learning outcomes. Additionally, predictions concerning the error attention dimensions of modeling and prompting were tested. Prompts were found to be more effective with the more proficient reader while models were more effective with the less proficient reader. The second experiment (Chapter Four) examined specific predictions about timing of error attention. Six, 6 year old normal readers received daily sessions of either delayed or immediate attention to errors. Every second day the subjects also read a text on which they were not tutored. Results showed that delayed attention increased the percent of errors self corrected for five subjects in both the tutored and non tutored texts. Increases in self corrections were consistently associated with increased accuracy. The data supported both the predictions and the proposed model of self correction behaviour as having a tutorial or self instruction function. Both experiments were discussed in terms of the functions of error attention in facilitating acquisition of proficient reading. Methodological issues in the behaviour analysis of oral reading were also discussed and implications from the studies for instruction in learning to read are drawn. The usefulness of concepts from 'structural' accounts of reading for a predictive 'functional' account of error attention is examined in a concluding section.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of reef-associated predators on adjacent soft-sediment communities</field><field name="creator">Langlois, Timothy John</field><field name="description">&#8216;Infaunal haloes&#8217; of either decreasing or increasing abundances of individual soft-sediment species with distance from reefs have been suggested to be caused by reef-associated predators. A large-scale mensurative experiment was used to investigate the distribution of two size classes of macrofauna with distance from the reef edge across three locations in northeastern New Zealand. The role of reef-associated predators, the snapper (Pagrus auratus Sparidae) and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii Palinuridae), was investigated using established marine reserves at each location. Consistent patterns were found in a few large-bodied fauna. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, whilst the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea were more abundant further away from the reef. Dosinia subrosea and another bivalve, Myadora striata, exhibited lower biomass at sites with higher densities of snapper and rock lobster. In contrast, small-bodied macrofauna showed no consistent patterns with distance from the reef or among sites with different predator populations. It was hypothesised that predation was driving the distribution of large bivalves. An experiment was done to investigate this model using D. subrosea. Equal densities of this bivalve were established in plots either with or without cages at sites either inside or outside of reserves. Significant predation was detected, but only inside reserves. Much of this mortality could be specifically attributed to predation by large rock lobsters, given the distinctive marks on the valves of dead D. subrosea. Inside reserves, predators are not only more abundant but also larger. It was hypothesised that different size classes of predators would result in different levels of predation. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate this model. Lobsters of all sizes chose D. subrosea over the heavier shelled D. anus. Small lobsters chose to prey on small D. subrosea and large lobsters more frequently chose larger prey. The distributions of these two bivalve species at protected (large predators) and fished sites (small predators) reflected the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. Results suggested that rock lobster populations are capable, where their size structure is not truncated by fishing pressure, of controlling population-level dynamics of bivalve communities adjacent to reefs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1894</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Xray diffraction Study of a diterpene</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Bryan Frederick</field><field name="description">The diterpene hydrocarbon rimuene has exercised over the years, the interest of a number of laboratories engaged in natural product research. As is usual with this class of compound its occurrence is confined almost entirely to the native New Zealand flora and although only two types of tree have been used as sources, it has been identified, often only in small amounts, in at least ten different species. Its co-occurrence with other diterpenes of similar chemical and physical properties has often made it hard to isolate and this, together with its geographic distribution has probably tended to limit its availability for research purposes, and hence delayed the elucidation of its structure. The awareness of the existence of this compound of undetermined structure has, therefore, caused a noticable gap in the knowledge of the diterpenoids, and this hiatus has been accentuated by Wenkert who, believing it to have a pimarane skeleton, suggested that it might be the important biogenetic precursor of a number of tetracyclic diterpenoids. Recent work, confirmed by the present investigation has, however, shown that previous structural predictions were incorrect and in actual fact rimuene has a rosane skeleton. As Ruzicka has shown for this class of compound, it has probably been formed from a pimarane diterpenoid and therefore represents a later biogenetic step than the other diterpene hydrocarbons which are always found with it in nature.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2593</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life history and demography of the pipi, Paphies australis (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Simon Holloway.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life history characteristics of the New Zealand pipi (Paphies australis) from gametogenesis, through spawning, larval development, settlement, juvenile recruitment patterns, distribution and abundance patterns, population size structure and growth characteristics from the Whangateau Harbour, in northeastern New Zealand. The thesis concludes by integrating this information into a model, based on hydrographic information and post settlement movement in order to help explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance of juvenile and adult pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. The temporal pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was investigated over two years (May 1991 - April 1993). Samples of pipi gonads were processed using standard histological techniques, and the resultant sections placed into six developmental categories (early active, late active, mature, partially spawned and indeterminate). Gametogenesis was similar in both years, beginning in autumn with most pi pi in early active stages of development. By late winter many pipi were mature. Spawning commenced in early spring and continued through spring and summer. From a sample of 104 pi pi collected in spring 1992 for investigation into the length at sexual maturity, all pipi were found to be sexually mature above 40 mm shell length, but some individuals between 30-40 mm also had gonads with sex cells present. This sample had a sex ratio significantly biased towards females. Further analysis revealed that juveniles (below 40 mm shell length) had a significantly higher proportion of females than males, but adults (above 40 mm shell length) had a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. No evidence of hermaphroditism was observed. The spatial pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was also investigated over one year (February 1992 to January 1993) at three subtidal sites using the same techniques as for the temporal study, but with one further category (parasitised). The reproductive cycle was similar between sites, with an extended spawning period . of late winter to summer. It was concluded that the reproductive cycle of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour was synchronised at all three sites sampled. A visual maturity index gave the same overall pattern of reproductive cycle as the histological analysis, but was found to be inaccurate mainly due to a poor recognition of the mature stages. It was concluded that the visual index was of limited value in accurately assessing the maturity of an individual. The sex ratio of adult pipi was not significantly different from 1: 1. A small percentage (0.87%) of pi pi were infected by a digenetic trematode fluke that, in most cases, totally castrated the individual. The larval development of pipi was described from larval culture experiments. Pi pi were conditioned, spawned and the resultant larvae reared to settlement in the laboratory. Adult pipi were successfully conditioned after 23 days at 22&#176;C. Spawning was accomplished using a combination of increased temperature and a dilute sperm solution. Settlement occurred 18-22 days after spawning at a mean shell length of 264 Ilm . After settlement and metamorphosis pi pi gradually began to take on the adult shape. Cultured juveniles were grown to 37 mm shell length both in the laboratory and later in the wild. Once in the wild, cultured pipi grew from 13 mm to 37 mm in 17 months with a strong seasonal component to their growth. Microscopic examination revealed slight differences in shell morphology between pi pi larvae and the closely related tuatua (Paphies subtriangu/ata) and toheroa (Paphies ventricosa). Pi pi were more rounded and smaller than both tuatua and toheroa at a similar stage of development. The results of scanning electron microscope examination of larval shell hinge structure confirmed previous preliminary findings for pipi. The larval shell ligament is posterior to the centre of the provinculum in pipi but central in both the tuatua and toheroa. These differences are sufficient to enable larval pipi to be distinguished from larval toheroa and tuatua. The spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of pipi were measured from November 1991 to January 1994. Previous information had suggested that pipi were a mainly intertidal species, but this study found that they can occur in large numbers subtidally. Temporal sampling was carried out by systematically measuring the abundance of pipi found within three subtidal grids. Abundances were compared within and between the grids. The subtidal population was extremely dense (up to 4400 m-2 ), with well defined boundaries. Pipi densities at the edges of the beds dropped from many hundreds to zero m-2 within 2 to 3 m. Large numbers of juvenile pi pi &#171;30 mm) were present at the start of sampling and the density of these decreased during the sampling period. Juvenile pipi occurred at high density at the harbour entrance site, but were rare or absent at the other two sites further up the harbour. Small scale distribution (ie. within a grid) at the harbour entrance showed high variability which was linked to large swells from storms, observed only at this site. The advantages of systematic sampling compared with random or haphazard sampling are discussed. The population size structure, growth and small scale movement patterns of pipi, were also studied. Pi pi formed a continuous bed from the harbour entrance up the main subtidal channel, and extended approximately one kilometre upstream. Pi pi had different shell morphologies at different sites within the harbour, and population size structure differed among sites. Small pi pi were found at either end of the subtidal pi pi bed but were absent from the middle. Analysis of length-frequency distributions indicated that there had been a large recruitment of pipi prior to the commencement of the study, but little further recruitment occurred during 1992 to 1994. Pipi took approximately three to four years to reach the population maximum size of 55-60 mm shell length. Tagged pipi, constrained in suspended nets grew more slowly than predicted from population length-frequency analysis, but tagged pi pi that were returned to the sediment grew as predicted. Localised movement of tagged pipi showed that pi pi gradually move into the centre (deeper part) of the channel and towards the harbour entrance. Adult and juvenile pipi, were observed drifting in mid-water, in the Whangateau Harbour. The animals were buoyed up by the secretion of long mucus threads which extended out through their siphons. Quantitative information from netting experiments over a period of five months from May 1993 to September 1993, collected a total of 509 drifting pipi. These were mainly juveniles &#171;15 mm shell length) but a small number of adults (up to 58 mm shell length) were also collected. The numbers of pi pi caught was highly variable, however, there was a trend for more drifting pipi to be caught on the flood tide (n=386) than the ebb tide (n=123). Overall there was little difference in the number of pipi caught between spring (n=263) and neap tides (n=246), however, this was heavily influenced by one neap tide in May 1993 (n=207). Three other bivalve species (So/etellina sp, Gari stangeri, Macomona . lilliana) were also caught drifting. Pipi were also observed to attach themselves to debris, such as dead branches of trees, which then moved them with the tidal currents. Large epiphytic algal growths on the shell also acted to buoy individuals which moved them around in tidal currents. It is hypothesised that mucus drifting in pipi is an active process, adopted for movement to other areas triggered by very high densities (over 4000 m2 ) in the harbour entrance. Finally, the distribution and size structure of the pi pi population was described by a simple model, based on the post-settlement movement of pi pi and tidal current patterns. Pipi recruits &#171;5 mm shell length) were found to be largely restricted to a small strip, mid-intertidally in clean coarse sediments. Juvenile pi pi (5-35 mm) were found at a low intertidal site directly downstream of the recruitment site. Further downstream of this site, at a subtidal site at the harbour entrance both juvenile and adult pi pi were found. A similar population size structure was found at the innermost extent of the pi pi bed in the main channel. Adult pi pi were abundant in the central part of the pi pi bed, but no juveniles were found at this site. It was concluded that post-settlement movement patterns could account for the distribution patterns of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. If subsequently found to be of more general applicability, this model provides a powerful, predictive tool for managing pipi population and possibly other infaunal clams. This study provides, for the first time, a detailed description of the distribution and abundance of an entire pipi population from one harbour. This information allows a more informed management of pi pi populations around New Zealand. It also provides a framework in which more indepth questions about the ecology of pipi populations (and other bivalve populations) can be more clearly addressed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5758</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exposure of ewes to stressors in mid- and late- pregnancy : postnatal effects on the ewe and lamb : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Corner, Rene Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to examine the effect of maternal undernutrition and exposure to stressors between pregnancy day 50 to 100 and 100 to 147 of pregnancy on the ewe and her lamb. The long-term effects of these stressors during pregnancy on lamb growth, plasma cortisol response to a stressor, metabolism, behaviour and future reproductive success were examined. Mid-pregnancy shearing The component of mid-pregnancy shearing that causes the increase in lamb birth weight is unknown. It was hypothesised that the increase in lamb birth weight was due to the stress response of the ewe to shearing. This work examined the effect of a range of stressors at approximately day 80 of pregnancy. These stressors included yarding, crutching and sham-shearing that may be components of the shearing procedure that produce a stress response. In addition, repeated stressors between day 74 and 106 of pregnancy including isolation, sham-shearing and exogenous cortisol injection were used to examine the role of a longer-term stress response on lamb birth weight. Mid-pregnancy shearing has consistently resulted in an increase in lamb birth weight, however all the other stressors investigated had no effect. Therefore, the hormonal stress response of ewes to shearing was unlikely to be the cause of the increase in lamb birth weight. Mid-pregnancy shearing also resulted in minor changes in ewe and lamb behaviour 12 to 24 h after birth. Shearing during pregnancy had no effect on the cortisol response of ram lambs to handling or castration however differences were observed between singleton- and twin-born lambs. Ewe nutrition during pregnancy Ewes mildly undernourished in between days 70 and 107 of pregnancy that were then provided with adequate nutrition between days 108-145 of pregnancy gave birth to lambs with similar birth weights as ewes well-fed during both periods. Therefore the effects of undernutrition on lamb birth weight can be minimised if undernutrition can be limited to the earlier period (day 70-107 and 108-147 of pregnancy). Mild undernutrition in both periods (day 70 &#8211; 145 of pregnancy), resulted in lambs that were lighter and that exhibited behaviours associated with a greater &#8216;drive&#8217; to maintain contact with their dam than lambs born to ewes well-fed during the same period. This suggests that even mild undernutrition in both mid- and late- pregnancy should be avoided. The effect of maternal nutrition and lamb litter size on the behaviour of female offspring was examined at 1 and 2 years of age. Litter size had no effect on ewe behaviour at 1 year of age however at 2 years of age twin-born ewes had higher maternal behaviour scores than triplet-born ewe lambs. Nutrition of the maternal grand dam during pregnancy had only a minor effect on the behaviour of female offspring at 1 year of age and no effect on maternal behaviour at 2 years of age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Long-term effects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300404 Animal husbandry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/763</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Otahuhu B Power Station condenser in-leakage analysis and condensate monitoring system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Electronics Engineering at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Heng</field><field name="description">Considerable ongoing risk of condenser in-leakage exists at Otahuhu B (OTB) Power Station. The condenser cooling water used at OTB station is corrosive brackish water with exceedingly high sodium and chloride concentrations. Significant signs of corrosion inside the condenser have been found recently. In the event of condenser in-leakage, the salt contaminants in the cooling water will directly enter the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) with the potential for significant and costly damage resulting in a long plant outage. A dynamic mathematical model was developed in the thesis to analyse the consequences of condenser in-leakage at OTB station. The analysis results show that the tolerance of the condenser to any leakage of cooling water is almost zero. Because the existing condensate monitoring system is not designed to detect contamination in this time frame, a new fast response system is required to detect condenser in-leakage immediately. A new dedicated fast response condensate monitoring system has been engineered and installed at OTB station as a part of the project scope. The new system dramatically reduces the response time to condenser in-leakage events. Critical instruments utilise multiple redundancy schemes to enhance the availability and reliability of the system. In addition, action level voting, timing, and alarming has been automated to assist operators in making correct decisions. The new condensate monitoring system is presently fully functional. The project has successfully achieved the objective of controlling the risk of condenser in-leakage events and minimising damage and negative effects on the plant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrosion</field><field name="subject">condensate monitoring system</field><field name="subject">cooling water</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290903 Other electronic engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/950</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of music therapy on self-reported affect in hospitalised paediatric patients : a thesis submitted to the New Zealand School of Music in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Music Therapy</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Ruth Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The present research examines the effect of music therapy on the affect of hospitalised children. It took place on a paediatric ward of a New Zealand public hospital. This study aimed to investigate the role of music therapy in addressing patients&#8217; psychosocial needs. Literature on the impact of hospitalisation, and on the use of music therapy in hospitals and paediatrics was reviewed. The research involved an audit of the therapist&#8217;s clinical notes from music therapy sessions over the course of seven months. The clinical notes included measurements of children&#8217;s mood from the beginning and end of sessions, using McGrath&#8217;s (1990) Affective Facial Scale. It was hypothesised that mood measures following music therapy would be higher than pre-music therapy scores. Statistical analysis of the facial scale data did not show a significant difference between &#8216;before&#8217; and &#8216;after&#8217; measures. These results were discussed with regard to a ceiling effect (this is, the measurements indicated patients were at the happy end of the scale before the music therapy session, so there was little room on the scale for mood to improve following music therapy). The measurement of emotion did not prove to be straightforward. The hospital environment may have influenced the patients&#8217; responses in a number of ways. These environmental influences are discussed with reference to examples from the clinical notes. The usefulness of facial scales in this context is discussed, as well as other limitations of the research. Suggestions for future research include the use of other mood measures, and the inclusion of measurements of parental mood and how this affects the child.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy for children</field><field name="subject">children hospital care psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1208</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metaphors of menopause in medicine : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Niland, Patricia Ruth</field><field name="description">Medical textbooks have previously represented women&#8217;s bodies and menopause life transitions by using notions of &#8216;machine productivity&#8217; and &#8216;machine breakdown&#8217; (Martin, 1987). This study aimed to explore whether these representations have changed, especially given recent HRT clinical trial results. Eight relevant compulsory medical textbooks for first and second year medical students at two New Zealand Universities were identified. A Foucauldian discourse analysis (Parker, 1990) was undertaken on relevant content to identify representations of menopause, HRT, women&#8217;s bodies, and ageing. Five major discourses were employed in the textbooks in descriptions of menopause and HRT: failure, estrogen deficiency as disease; HRT as saviour; obscurity and the new discovery discourse. Menopause continues to be represented as resulting from a &#8216;failure&#8217; of a machine-like body. Although the recent HRT clinical trials were reported as a serious risk factor in half of the textbooks, HRT was also represented as a saviour particularly against postmenopausal osteoporosis. The discovery of &#8216;new&#8217; drugs to &#8216;treat&#8217; HRT and the &#8216;postmenopausal&#8217; patient were heralded with much excitement. Medical textbooks continue to use failure discourses to describe women&#8217;s bodies at menopause. New risk-based HRT assessments for &#8216;patients&#8217; with menopause &#8216;symptoms&#8217; are promoted. These portrayals reinforce linear and reductionist ways of thinking about menopause and women at midlife and provide few spaces for resistance or alternative constructions to more accurately reflect women&#8217;s embodied worlds.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Menopause</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Health psychology</field><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1338</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of system integrations and XML applications within a NZ government agency : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Information Systems at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Li, Steven</field><field name="description">With the evolution of Information Technology, especially the Internet, system integration is becoming a common way to expand IT systems within and beyond an enterprise network. Although system integration is becoming more and more common within large organizations, however, the literature review had found IS research in this area had not been sufficient, especially for the development of integration solutions within large organizations. It has made research like this one conducted within a large NZ government agency necessary. Four system integration projects were selected and studied using case study research methodology. The case study was designed and conducted using guidelines mainly from the well-known R. K. Yin&#8217;s (2002) &#8220;Case Study Research&#8221; book. The research was set to seek answers for a series of research questions, which were related to requirements of system integration and challenges for solution development. Special attention had been given to XML applications, as system integration and XML were found to be coupled in many system integrations and frameworks during the literature review. Data were first gathered from all four projects one by one, and then the bulk of analysis was done on the summarized data. Various analysis methods including chain-of-evidence, root-cause-analysis and pattern-matching were adopted. The principles of interpretive research proposed by Klein and Myers (1999) and triangulation were observed. In conclusions, a set of models have been derived from the research, namely a model for clarifying integration requirements; a model for integration solution architecture; a model for integration development life cycle and a model of critical success factor for integration projects. A development framework for small to medium size integration projects has also been proposed based on the models. The research also found XML application indeed would play an important role for system integration; the critical success factors for XML application included suitable development tools, development skills and methodologies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="subject">Integration solution architecture</field><field name="subject">Computer networks</field><field name="subject">New Zealand government agency</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280112 Information systems development methodologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1627</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution in a marine gastropod : rocks, clocks, DNA and diversity : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Evolutionary Biology</field><field name="creator">Hills, Simon Francis Kahu</field><field name="description">Comprehensive integration of paleontological and molecular data remains a sought-after goal of evolutionary research. This thesis presents a dataset unlike any previously studied to document changes over time in the evolutionary history of the New Zealand marine mollusc genus Alcithoe. In order to study evolutionary relationships in the Alcithoe, DNA sequence of approximately 8Kb of mitochondrial DNA was generated using universal and newly developed PCR primers. The gene composition of the resulting sequences has been thoroughly analysed, using a novel splits-based approach, to gain a clear understanding of the underlying phylogenetic signals in the data. Refinement of the phylogeny was achieved by considering subsets of both the taxa and genes. Taking these analyses into account the combined a robust phylogeny for the Alcithoe is presented for use in subsequent analyses. The Alcithoe genus includes species that are exemplars of the problem of correctly identifying species by morphological traits, in both the living and extinct taxa. Taxonomic assignments were explored in a population level analysis of the highly morphologically variable species A. wilsonae. Analyses revealed that the various recognised forms of A. wilsonae are genetically indistinguishable and that the previously recognised species A. knoxi is a synonym of A. wilsonae. This result has significant implications for the interpretation of the paleontological data, as A. knoxi specimens are known from the Tongaporutuan stage (10.92 &#8211; 6.5 Ma) of the New Zealand geological timescale. Therefore, this finding also has implications on the assignment of calibration data in molecular clock analysis. To ensure accurate estimation of divergence times and rates of molecular evolution, extensive explorations of parameter space in molecular-clock analyses were carried out. These analyses identified the most appropriate models and calibration settings for Alcithoe the dataset. The fossil data used to calibrate this analysis is amongst the most robust applied to molecular clock analyses to date. Statistical sampling uncertainty derived from the paleontological data was included in the calculation of prior distributions. Divergence dates inferred for the extant Alcithoe are largely consistent with the fossil record. However, the root of the tree was consistently inferred to be younger then expected. Rates of evolution in the species of Alcithoe included in this analysis are broadly consistent. However, some small rate differences are observed in some branches, for example, Alcithoe fusus appears to have a faster rate then the rest of the genus. This rate increase is the likely cause of topological inconsistencies observed for four closely related taxa, including A. fusus, and indicates that slight rate differences can cause phylogenetic instability when small genetic distances are involved. Direct comparison of diversification rates between the molecular and paleontological data for the Alcithoe illustrated that modern Alcithoe species have origins that are around 13 millions years younger then the oldest known Alcithoe fossils. The suggestion that A. fusus is descended from a series of fossil Leporemax species is directly contradicted by the molecular tree. In light of the molecular evidence this result highlights the problem of morphological convergence in the interpretation of fossil Alcithoe species. Comparison of the molecular and paleontological datasets was difficult for absolute speciation and extinction rates, as errors inherent to each dataset led to disparate estimates. For example, the fossil record clearly fails to record most recent speciation events observed in the molecular phylogeny, but the molecular data cannot sufficiently account for the amount of extinction evident in the fossil record. It is clear that the assumption of a constant and equal probability of speciation and extinction for all lineages is violated in the Alcithoe. However, the general long-term trends estimated for both datasets are concordant, and demonstrate an increase in both speciation and extinction rates over the Cenozoic era. The research described in this thesis represents significant progress toward the goal of more thorough integration of molecular and paleontological in the study of evolution. I have shown that reconciliation of molecular and paleontological data is not only possible, but can substantially improve the resulting interpretation of evolution. This study is the broadest analysis of the evolution in a single genus using combined molecular and paleontological data that the author is currently aware of. It illustrates the advantage of having quality paleontological data to compare to emerging molecular data, and how the molecular data can further inform the paleontological data. Furthermore, it adds support to the shift in perspective from an adversarial to a complementary approach to the consideration of molecular and paleontological data. This thesis is a comprehensive first step in the synthesis of molecular and paleontological data in the study of evolution of the New Zealand mollusc fauna, and alludes to many promising avenues for future study.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcithoe</field><field name="subject">Gastropod phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1628</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The story of wired schools : a study of internet-using teachers : a thesis submitted as partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Brown, Mark E.</field><field name="description">The story of wired schools addresses the lack of critical debate over the adoption and implementation of the Internet in New Zealand schools. It is set in the backdrop of rapid technological change and growing international concern over the wisdom of the substantial investment in new computer technology in the education system. The study addresses the problem that the hype surrounding the Internet in schools is potentially diverting much attention away from its real pedagogical value. Thus, the research objective investigates how teachers believe the Internet has affected learning and teaching&#8212;for better and worse. In the context of this objective, a number of methodological issues related to conducting research in the area of educational technology are considered and a multi-paradigmatic framework is adopted utilizing both quantitative and qualitative research techniques. The research consists of three phases over a period of three school years. It reports a process to identify and systematically investigate a purposive sample of proficient, accomplished and experienced internet-using teachers. The first phase involves a survey in which a written questionnaire gathers baseline information on the background characteristics, experiences, perceptions and practices of a group of teachers nominated as proficient in using the Internet for learning and teaching. In Phase Two, the survey is repeated through a follow up questionnaire and informant interview with a refined sample of perceived accomplished internet-using teachers. The final phase culminates with narrative-biographical and micro ethnographic case studies of three teachers judged to be experienced in using the Internet for pedagogical purposes. An analysis of data shows that the advent of the Internet has clearly had an impact on the nature of teachers' work. The standout effects of the Internet are reported under the themes of: (a) school organization and classroom management, (b) displacement costs, (c) collegial relationships, (d) workload considerations, and (e) teachers thinking more globally. Notably, the research shows that teachers do not simply experience the Internet, they reshape and reframe it based on their pedagogical beliefs and lived experiences. Thus, teachers have equally affected the Internet and these effects are reported under the themes of: (a) differential uptake, (b) limited local action, (c) teaching is messy, (d) computer as tool, and (e) technology as progress. The key lesson is that the implementation of an educational technology is a mutually adaptive process full of conflicts, tensions, and contradictions that simultaneously give rise to positive, negative, and unknown effects. Accordingly, the effects of the Internet on teachers' lives and work culture can not be analysed in terms of simple dichotomies of good and bad as a more dialectical perspective is required of the relationship between technology and society. A rough portrait of the educational technology landscape is sketched from the tensions and individual mindsets embedded in the research sample, and the shape of the topography is shown to amplify rival theoretical positions in the literature. From a post-technocratic political economy perspective, the new digital landscape consists of a number of competing and coexisting discourses that borrow and co-construct a socio-cognitive language of persuasion to advance their own hegemonic agenda. Such an analysis brings into question the hidden curriculum behind the new ways of enterprise constructivism promoting the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) in New Zealand schools. The ensuing discussion endeavours to reframe the teacher's role around critical pedagogy and the need for pedagogical activism in the backdrop of a number of potential dark clouds looming on the digital horizon. Finally, the story of wired schools is brought together through the metaphor of planes, trains and automobiles in which a lot of misinformation, dissembling language and even propaganda is claimed to prevent teachers from understanding the meaning and non-educational intention of the ICT-related school reform movement. A number of implications arise from the explanation of how things have come to be this way and these are presented for teachers, researchers and policy-makers. The central thesis is that teachers need to approach the ICT movement as problematic and a deeper level of critical dialogue is required over the move to plug New Zealand schools into the Knowledge Economy. In short, wired schools require wired educators capable of reading and responding to current efforts to boost capacity, increase bandwidth and catch the knowledge wave&#8212;for better and worse.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet in education</field><field name="subject">Computers in schools</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330107 Educational technology and media</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1629</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preharvest practices affecting postharvest quality of 'Hayward' kiwifruit : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Physiology and Horticultural Science at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buxton, Katrina Norah</field><field name="description">Repeat purchase of kiwifruit is primarily driven by consumer judgement of internal fruit quality attributes, including those affected by dry matter concentration (DMC) and mineral composition in fruit. This research investigated mechanisms affecting carbohydrate, mineral and water accumulation in 'Hayward' kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa), and related these to specific management practices. Canopy manipulation through pruning and treatments such as artificial pollination, defoliation, girdling, thinning and application of the auxin transport inhibitor TIBA, may affect fruit DMC and mineral composition. Leaf photosynthesis and fruit dry matter concentrations (DMC) started to decline as leaf area index values increased above 3-4. In addition to reducing competition for carbohydrates between vegetative and reproductive growth, leader pruning probably increased DMCs of fruit in the leader zone by improving light interception. Photosynthesis was not affected by crop loads between 20- 60 fruit m-2, but was consistently higher on non-terminating (long) shoots than on terminating (short) shoots, as were fruit DMCs. Differences in photosynthetic rate of leaves on these two shoot types were attributed to differences in shoot exposure to the sun, and also to the greater demand for carbohydrate within long shoots. Leaves subtending fruit may increase Ca, and to a lesser extent Mg, flow into fruit, however their accumulation was not affected by leaves outside the fruiting shoot. Xylem sap Ca and Mg concentrations were higher in shoots with a high rather than a low leaf: fruit (L:F) ratio and this may, at least partially, relate to the increase in shoot transpiration that occurs as shoot L:F ratios increase. Within vine variation in fruit Ca concentrations may reflect variations in xylem sap flow rates and Ca concentrations of xylem sap reaching fruit. Calcium translocation may occur independently of ion movement in the transpiration stream. Timing and extent of vascular differentiation in flower and fruitlet pedicels, possibly regulated by auxin, may influence fruit Ca accumulation. It is likely that early differentiation of vascular tissue in flower and fruitlet pedicels influenced cell division and subsequent (carbohydrate) sink strength of fruit by determining availability of carbohydrate for partitioning into cell walls. While growers have the potential to induce minor changes in fruit DMC, further increases will depend on the separation of carbohydrate and water accumulation. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms regulating phloem transport and unloading of sucrose in kiwifruit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Actinidia deliciosa</field><field name="subject">Kiwifruit physiology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1630</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-sectional analysis of pricing efficiency, liquidity, and information asymmetry</field><field name="creator">Gao, Xin</field><field name="description">This paper tests the relation between pricing efficiency and liquidity, with and without, the effects of asymmetric information.

The result indicates that liquidity associated with asymmetric information effects enhances pricing efficiency. The cross-sectional relation between relative informational efficiency and liquidity combed with informed trading is significantly positive.

Spurred by the prospect of spintronic devices, which use the spin degree of freedom of electrons instead of, or combined with, the charge degree of freedom, we analyse the spin properties of quantum wires, organic conducting polymers and sheets of graphene. First, we examine a quantum wire that is embedded in a two dimensional electron gas. We consider the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and include the effect of interaction between the conduction electrons. We construct an analytically solvable low-energy theory for the wire, and explore the interaction between two magnetic impurities in the wire. We find that both the spin-orbit coupling and the electron-electron interaction have an effect on the magnetic interaction, and find the magnetic interaction to be tunable by an electric field. Next, we study an organic conducting polymer, which is contacted to magnetised ferromagnetic leads. In semiconducting organic polymers the current is transported by spinful polarons and spinless bipolarons. We simulate the transport through the system, including both types of charge carriers, and find the current to be insensitive to the presence of bipolarons. In addition, we find the bipolaron density to depend on the relative magnetisation of the ferromagnetic contacts. This constitutes an optical way of measuring the spin accumulation in conducting polymers. Finally, we investigate the optical conductivity of graphene. Symmetry arguments indicate the existence of two kinds of spin-orbit coupling in the two dimensional lattice, but there is no consensus about the actual strength of these couplings. We calculated the microwave optical conductivity of graphene including both possible spin-orbit interactions. We find the low frequency dependence of the optical conductivity to have a unique imprint of the spin-orbit couplings. This opens a possibility to experimentally determine both couplings separately.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spintronic devices</field><field name="subject">Spin and spin-dependent transport properties</field><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1632</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A girls' eye view of aggressive adolescent female behaviour : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Arnott, Rosemary M</field><field name="description">This thesis challenges media claims that adolescent girls in New Zealand are becoming more aggressive and are therefore behaving like boys. Most early studies of aggression ignored girls entirely or presented them as a subset of boys. Although later studies did address issues around girls&#8217; aggressive behaviour, these were largely focused on adults&#8217; views of girls&#8217; relational or social aggression. This doctoral study therefore used a small case study to explore adolescent aggression from the perspective of six adolescent girls whose behaviour had been described by their schools as aggressive. The girls&#8217; accounts of their experiences and beliefs about gender-specific aggression were gathered via a series of individual conversational interviews, and initially analysed through the theoretical perspective of role theory and psychological perspectives on aggression. However, as the study progressed, the limitations of that approach became apparent and the girls&#8217; transcripts were revisited via the lens of poststructural theory, using the tools of discourse analysis. The study found that these girls&#8217; behaviours and beliefs did not fit the description of severe adolescent female aggression as described in the literature. Nor did the risk factors most commonly associated with aggression at adolescence appear to have affected them. Conversely, it would appear that their physicality influenced how they positioned themselves and how others positioned them; as &#8220;sporty girls&#8221;, &#8220;tomboys&#8221;, &#8220;loving daughters and siblings&#8221;, or as &#8220;righteous aggressors&#8221;. Their behaviours frequently challenged the dominant discourse of conventional schoolgirls. None of them thought that girls were becoming more aggressive and all stated that girls could behave how they wanted without being labelled de facto boys. This study was limited in terms of the number of participants and the range of cultures represented, therefore no generalisations can be drawn from it. Nevertheless, it does have some important implications for policy makers and practitioners: particularly that interactions of culture, class and gender impact on the way that individuals constitute themselves and others. Interpretations of behaviour are determined by the discursive context and the experiences and belief systems of both &#8220;actor&#8221; and &#8220;audience&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescent girls</field><field name="subject">Aggression</field><field name="subject">Aggressive behaviour</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1633</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Jewish Community In New South Wales 1914-1939</field><field name="creator">Rutland, Suzanne D.</field><field name="description">Master of Arts</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jews -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy.</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Australia -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6536</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of factors responsible for boar testicular hypertrophy following neonatal hemicastration</field><field name="creator">Mr Reece Wells</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictions and perspectives: Exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and substance use by young males and females.</field><field name="creator">Ms Kim Johnston</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a time of experimentation and exploration. For many young people, a feature of this developmental period is the initiation of substance use. Whilst the majority of young people do not go on to develop substance use problems, any substance use has potential for danger. The current body of literature on the prevention of substance use problems suggests that in order to advance understanding, researchers must adopt a risk-focused approach. There is a wide range of indices that have been cited as risk factors for the development of substance use disorders. Chapter 2 explores some of the aetiological models and literature on risk factors with specific reference to psychological wellbeing, studies highlighting comorbid relationships between adolescent mental health and substance use problems, and the functional value of substances in relation to well-being. Although attention to psychological risk factors has received increased press in the literature, the number of controlled, longitudinal studies is relatively small. A review of recent studies (Chapter 3) indicates that the presence of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or behavioural problems such as delinquency represent psychological risk factors for the development of later substance use problems, however findings are inconsistent and many studies do not examine differential predictive utility by substance or gender. Thus, Study 1 of this research aimed to add to this body of work by exploring the prediction of alcohol, cannabis and other illicit substance use at age fifteen from key indicators of psychological well-being taken at age thirteen. The data from a normative sample of high school students indicated subtle differences in trajectory for young males and females and effects specific to different drug categories. Delinquency emerged as the most consistent predictor in both males and females. Low self-esteem was also an important indicator for future female marijuana use and marijuana intoxication and both male and female other illicit substance use. The findings highlighted the need for a greater contextual understanding of the relationship between delinquency, self-esteem and substance use. The second study sought to provide a deeper understanding of these issues by examining the perceived functional value of substances in relation to psychological wellbeing, by means of a qualitative study of a group of young people who had experienced problems with their substance use. Chapter 4 explores the limited phenomenological research in this area, with a focus on studies which have used methods of measurement that highlight the perspective of young people. Using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach, Study 2 builds on the drug type and gender contrasts noted in Study 1, and explores the interface between substance use and psychological well-being in depth using a clinical population. A number of key functions are identified by young people, with evidence of both convergence and divergence across drug categories (alcohol, cannabis, other illicit substances). Interviewees reported six functions common to all substances; social connectedness, improve affect, positive self-transformation, better coping with problems, fun and laughter, and feeling intoxicated. Nine additional functions were identified in relation to cannabis and other illicit substances. Several gender differences were also noted, with males tending to report more positive reinforcement from alcohol and cannabis, and young females more frequently describing benefits related to use of other illicit substances. The concluding chapter (Chapter 5) reviews the main findings across both studies and their implications for theory, practice, and future research. Overall, the findings of the research provide support for both problem behaviour and adaptive models of adolescent substance use, and indicate that young people are capable of reflecting on their substance use experiences. Incorporating the wisdom of young people into risk frameworks may enhance prevention, education and intervention efforts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent, substance misuse, psychological well-being, consensual qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161713</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making a Mark: negotiations in the commoditisation of authenticity and value at an Aboriginal art dealership</field><field name="creator">Barbara Ashford</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of processes of the dealership regarding Aboriginal art and artists. I take the approach that the art dealership is situated at a nexus of relationships that contest and negotiate culturally informed values and categories of fine art, Aboriginality and commodities. I argue that dealers in Aboriginal art mediate categories of value through their particular practices of representation of the art and through the social relationships they foster with artists and buyers. Therefore, through the relationships formed in the exchange process, dealers both make and mark culture. In this study I acknowledge the agency of Aboriginal artists but approach the process of negotiation of cultural categories from the perspective of the non-Indigenous audience for which the art is intended. The research is specifically concentrated on a particular dealership, Fire-Works gallery in Brisbane. I begin with the premise that buyers are drawn to Aboriginal art for more than aesthetic reasons and that objects and artists&#8217; cultural identities carry high value especially if judged authentically Aboriginal in the current art market. Both the art and the artists are made and marked as commodities in the art market; and while notions of authenticity are central to value, value is itself shifting and authenticity unstable. To establish the tensions and shifts in culture formation, I outline the historical biography of the acceptance of Aboriginal objects as fine art and the genesis of Fire-Works gallery within this socio-cultural and political milieu. In the latter chapters of the thesis I examine social relationships and situated practices chosen by the dealership to facilitate sales through the negotiation of valued cultural categories. The study provides an original examination of how shifting cultural categories are dynamically formed and reformed in the commoditisation of Aboriginal art by social agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">value, commoditisation, art, exchange, authenticity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177316</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Healing architecture': A study of daylight in public hospital designs in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Srazali Aripin</field><field name="description">In the hospital building, where patients seek medical treatment and hospital staff provide continuous support, creating a healing environment is an imperative. However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytogenetics and speciation in Drosophila tetrachaeta Angus.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Donald Scott.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Drosophila.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characteristics of hydrocyclones : and their application as control units in comminution circuits</field><field name="creator">Rao, T.

Under favourable conditions, certain cyanobacteria can dominate the phytoplankton within a waterbody and form nuisance blooms. Case reports and anecdotal references dating from 1949 describe a range of illnesses associated with recreational exposure to cyanobacteria: hay fever-like symptoms, pruritic skin rashes and gastro-intestinal symptoms (the latter probably related to ingestion of water) are most frequently reported. Some papers give convincing descriptions of allergic responses to cyanobacteria; others describe more serious acute illnesses, with symptoms such as severe headache, pneumonia, fever, myalgia, vertigo and blistering in the mouth. A U.S. coroner recently found that a teenage boy died as a result of accidentally ingesting a neurotoxic cyanotoxin from a golf course pond; this is the first recorded human fatality attributed to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria. One of the main public health concerns with exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria relates to the understanding that some blooms produce toxins that specifically affect the liver or the central nervous system. The route of exposure for these toxins is oral, from accidental or deliberate ingestion of recreational water, and possibly by inhalation. Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are also reported to be putative cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory and pyrogenic toxins. The aims of this project were to enhance the understanding of public health issues relating to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria by conducting epidemiological and laboratory-based toxicology studies. A prospective cohort study of 1,331 recreational water users was conducted at various sites in southern Queensland, the Myall Lakes area of New South Wales, and central Florida. The study design sought to make improvements over previously published epidemiological studies, in that an unexposed group was recruited from cyanobacteria-free waters, cyanobacterial toxins were measured in site water samples, and respondents were asked to rate the severity of reported symptoms. This study has shown an increased likelihood of symptom reporting amongst bathers exposed to high cyanobacterial cell density (measured by total cell surface area) compared to those exposed to low cyanobacteria-affected waters. Mild respiratory symptoms appear to be the predominant symptom category. A clinical dermatology study to examine delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions to cyanobacterial extracts was conducted. The study groups were 20 patients presenting for diagnostic skin patch testing at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's dermatology outpatient clinic; a convenience sample of 20 individuals was recruited from outside the hospital as a control group. One patient developed unequivocal reactions to several cyanobacteria extracts, with no dose-response pattern seen, indicating that the reactions were allergic in nature. A mouse model of delayed-contact hypersensitivity, the mouse ear swelling test, has demonstrated that the purified toxin cylindrospermopsin, a highly water-soluble compound, is capable of producing cutaneous injury. Encrusting lesions were seen on abdominal skin during the induction phase of these experiments. Delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions were also demonstrated with this toxin. LPS from two non-axenic cyanobacterial samples - Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa - were extracted and purified. Thermoregulation studies were performed using a mouse model of rectal temperature measurement. Separate groups of mice were injected with these LPS extracts at two dose levels. Thermoregulation studies were also conducted with purified cyanobacterial toxins: microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a; cyanobacterial LPS samples purified by collaborators in Adelaide were also investigated for thermoregulation potential. These experiments have shown that the LPS extracts are weakly active when compared with responses to much lower doses of Escherichia coli LPS. Cylindrospermopsin also produces hypothermic responses in mice - comparable to pyrexia in larger mammals - although at a later stage than was seen with LPS extracts. Supplementing the experimental observations of the toxicology and immunotoxicology of cyanobacterial LPS are insights gained from beyond the cyanobacteria literature on the mechanisms of toxicity of different LPS structures. Cyanobacterial LPS was initially suggested to be toxic in the 1970s, at a time when lipid A, the active moiety of LPS, was thought to be identical across all Gram-negative bacteria. More recent work raises questions about the attribution of cutaneous and gastrointestinal illness to cyanobacterial LPS, with the understanding that some bacterial lipid A structures are LPS antagonists, LPS is not toxic by the oral route, and LPS is not reported as a toxin in the clinical dermatology literature. Gut-derived lipopolysaccharides, however, exert potent synergistic effects with a variety of xenobiotic hepatotoxins, and the well-known shock-like syndromes associated with severe cylindrospermopsin and microcystin poisoning deserve further scrutiny from the perspective of immunotoxicology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321201 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety</field><field name="subject">321299 Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730210 Environmental health</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">blue-green algae</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">health effects</field><field name="subject">recreational</field><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">recreational water</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">cutaneous</field><field name="subject">lipopolysaccharide</field><field name="subject">thermoregulation</field><field name="subject">immunotoxicology</field><field name="subject">innate immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9880</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Mosquitoes in the Emergence of Japanese Encephalitis Virus in Australia</field><field name="creator">Van Den Hurk, A.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating a large scale collaborative venture (LSCV) project: An approach to economic growth based on a strategic marketing evaluation of the Multifunction Polis Project (1987 - 1990)</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Maxwell James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Multifunction polis.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185343</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The introduction of the music of ethnic minority groups into Queensland State Schools</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Judith M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">9304 School/Institution</field><field name="subject">750306 Ethnicity and multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">School music -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186234</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict and conflict management in urban planning : the application of general theories to urban planning in the Queensland Local Government context</field><field name="creator">Minnery, J.

The central hypothesis of the thesis is that the equity risk premium, combined with the public nature of toll roads, makes private financing of this kind of public infrastructure undesirable. It attempts to test this hypothesis by valuing the project under standard CAPM and WACC frameworks, and then modelling the sensitivity of the project&#8217;s value to different assumptions regarding traffic flows, inflation, asset risk, and errors in operating-cost forecasts. The results show that with large equity contributions the project is inherently unstable and given the finance structure, was always susceptible to a downward price spiral of the type observed. The thesis then models the project value under a public finance option and concludes that this is a more beneficial option for investors, the government, and the community alike.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Equity Premium Puzzle</field><field name="subject">Public finance</field><field name="subject">Public Private Partnerships</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213089</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reaction mechanism of pyruvate carboxylase</field><field name="creator">Easterbrook-Smith, Simon Barnett</field><field name="description">1. The 2 ', 3 ' -dialdehyde derivative of ATP (oATP) was prepared by periodate oxidation, and on the following criteria was considered to be an affinity label of the MgATP &#178;&#8315;  binding site of sheep liver pyruvate carboxylase. The magnesium complex of this inhibitor (Mg-oATP &#178; &#8315; ) was shown to be a linear competitive inhibitor with respect to MgATP &#178; &#8315;  in both the acetyl CoA-dependent and -independent activities of the enzyme but was a non-competitive inhibitor with respect to bicarbonate and an un-competitive inhibitor with respect to pyruvate. Mg-oATP &#178; &#8315;  was covalently bound to pyruvate carboxylase by reduction using sodium borohydride with concurrent irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Although pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and bicarbonate were ineffective, both acetyl CoA and MgATP &#178; &#8315;  protected the enzyme against this chemical modification. Mg &#178; &#8314;  enhanced the extent of chemical modification. At 100% inactivation, 1.1 &#177; 0.1 moles of Mg-oATP &#178; &#8315;  were bound to the enzyme per mole of biotin. The presence or absence of acetyl CoA had no affect on this stoichiometry. Chromatography of samples of an enzymic digest of Mg - o [&#185;  &#8308;  C ] ATP &#178; &#8315;  -labelled enzyme revealed one major band of radioactivity which co-chromatographed with authentic lys-oATP markers.  2. In order to further characterise the lysyl residue (s) in the biotin carboxylation site, the use of cyanate as a potential affinity label of the bicarbonate binding site was investigated. Cyanate was shown to chemically modify sheep liver pyruvate carboxylase, with concurrent inactivation of the enzyme. The rate of loss of acetyl CoA-independent catalytic activity was not pseudo first-order with respect to time. When the inactivation data were analysed assuming that modified enzyme retains some residual acetyl CoA-independent activity, it was found that only one kinetically significant residue per active site was modified, but cyanate appeared to form a reversible complex with the enzyme prior to modifying this residue. Acetyl CoA, pyruvate and oxaloacetate were found to have no affect on the rate of modification of the enzyme. Bicarbonate, MgADP, and MgATP &#178; &#8315;  all afforded protection against inactivation of the enzyme. MgATP2 &#8315;  afforded almost complete protection against loss of both the acetyl CoA-dependent and - independent catalytic activities. Analysis of the concentration dependence of protection by bicarbonate and MgATP &#178; &#8315;  suggested that cyanate could not inactivate the enzyme - MgATP &#178; &#8315;  and enzyme-bicarbonate complexes. The enzyme MgADP was found to be inactivated at about 30% of the rate of free enzyme. Modification of the enzyme with cyanate was found to inactivate the ATP/P [subscript i] isotopic exchange reaction, but to enhance the pyruvate/oxaloacetate isotopic exchange reaction. Inactivation of pyruvate carboxylase with [&#185;  &#8308;   C ] cyanate was shown to be associated with modification of at least six amino acid residues per mole of biotin. Chromato-graphy of samples of an enzyme digest of [&#185;  &#8308;  C ] cyanate-labelled enzyme revealed that only amino groups in the enzyme had been modified. A major band of radioactivity was shown to co-chromatograph with authentic homo-citrulline. 3. The stoichiometry of the products of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was shown to vary as the concentration of pyruvate was altered. At high concentrations of pyruvate, the ratio of orthophosphate liberated to oxaloacetate produced approached one, but, as the pyruvate concentration decreased, the ratio increased. On the basis of this evidence, a model for the reaction pathway was proposed in which the carboxybiotin-enzyme complex could react either with pyruvate to produce oxaloacetate, or water to regenerate enzyme-biotin and bicarbonate. The non-productive breakdown of the enzyme-substrate complex provides an explanation for the non-linear double reciprocal plots obtained for both the overall reaction and the pyruvate/oxaloacetate exchange reaction. Since neither the rate of breakdown of the isolated carboxybiotin-enzyme complex, nor the rate of decarboxylation of oxaloacetate in the absence of pyruvate could account for the difference in the amounts of the two products formed in the overall reaction, it was postulated that the presence of pyruvate was necessary for hydrolysis to occur. Rate equations were derived describing the dependence of the initial velocity release of oxaloacetate in the overall reaction, and the rate of the pyruvate/oxaloacetate exchange reaction, on pyruvate concentration. By assigning appropriate values to the various rate constants, theoretical curves were obtained and fitted to the experimental data. The reaction pathway of the pyruvate carboxylase catalysed reaction was re-examined using two independent experimental approaches not previously applied to this enzyme. To avoid the variable stoichiometry associated with oxaloacetate formation, the reaction rate was measured by following orthophosphate release. Initial velocities, when plotted as a function of varying concentrations of either MgATP &#178; &#8315;  or bicarbonate, at fixed levels of pyruvate, gave, in double reciprocalform, families of straight, intersecting lines. Furthermore, when the reaction was determined as a function of varying MgATP &#178; &#8315;  concentration, using pyruvate, 2-ketobutyrate, and 3-fluoro-pyruvate as alternative keto-acid substrates, the slopes of the double reciprocal plots were significantly different. Both results suggest that the pyruvate carboxylase reaction has a sequential pathway, at least at high keto-acid substrate concentrations. However, an analysis of the slope replots of the initial velocity orthophosphate release data suggested that the reaction via a non-sequential pathway at low keto-acid substrate concentrations. Rate equations describing the dependence of initial velocity release of oxaloacetate and orthophosphate on the concentrations of substrates were derived and were shown to be consistent with the initial velocity kinetic data presently available. Possible extensions of the concept of hydrolytic breakdown of an intermediate enzyme complex to other enzymes were discussed. 4. The interaction of acetyl CoA with sheep liver pyruvate carboxylase was investigated using two independent experimental approaches. Evidence consistent with lack of co-operativity of acetyl CoA binding under initial velocity assay conditions was obtained from an analysis of the protection afforded by acetyl CoA against TNBS modification of the enzyme. Furthermore, the dependence of the rate of acetyl CoA deacylation on acetyl CoA concentration was found to be consistent with lack of co-operativity of binding of acetyl CoA. Evidence was obtained which suggested that the observed non-classical initial-velocity acetyl CoA profile arose because of acetyl CoA-dependent changes in the saturation of the enzyme with pyruvate and bicarbonate, and in the rate of dilution inactivation of the enzyme. The n [subscript H] value obtained from an analysis of the dependence of initial velocity oxaloacetate synthesis on acetyl CoA concentration using the Hill equation was shown to depend on the fixed concentrations of pyruvate and bicarbonate in the assay solutions. The fixed concentrations of MgATP &#178; &#8315;  and K &#8314;  were found to have no affect on the n [subscript H] value. The time period over which the reaction rate was linear with time was found to depend on the acetyl CoA concentration in the assay solution. At high concentrations of acetyl CoA, the process of dilution inactivation was prevented, and hence the reaction was linear with time for a longer period than at low concentrations of acetyl CoA. Dilution inactivation was shown not to involve formation of catalytically active pyruvate carboxylase dimers or monomers. When an experiment was designed in which all substrates and activators were present at saturating levels regardless of the acetyl CoA concentration, and the enzyme concentration was raised to a level where dilution inactivation did not occur, the dependence of the rate of oxaloacetate synthesis on acetyl CoA concentration was found to be consistent with lack of co-operativity of binding of acetyl CoA to pyruvate carboxylase.</field><field name="date">1977</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyruvate carboxylase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37988</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kinetic studies of some solid-state reactions of metal sulfides</field><field name="creator">Wang, Haipeng</field><field name="description">This thesis is submitted as a portfolio of peer-reviewed publications.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">monosulfide solid solution, metal sulfides</field><field name="subject">Metal sulphides</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38003</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and metamorphic relations between low, medium and high grade rocks, Mt. Franks - Mundi Mundi area, Broken Hill, N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Glen, Richard Arthur</field><field name="description">Investigations in the northwestern part of the Willyama Complex centred on the Mt Franks - Mundi Mundi area have established a 4 km thick stratigraphic section of conformable metasediments containing thin horizons of basic volcanics in the lower two - thirds of the sequence. Establishment of this sequence was only possible once it was shown that the dominant lithological layering in metasediments is bedding, and that there has been no mesoscopic transposition during deformation. The metasediments represent a sequence of clay sands deposited in a distal shelf-slope or basin type of environment. A sequence of deformational and metamorphic events established in these rocks is regarded as an expression of the Middle Proterozoic Olarian Orogeny ( c.1695 - 1520 Ma. ) and except for some reactivation of shear zones, predate deposition and deformation of the unconformably overlying Adelaidean sediments. The important D&#8321; deformation is a complex, progressive event with pre-S&#8321; static mineral growth (biotite, andalusite, sillimanite, white mica) and early minor micro-folding recognized before syn-S&#8321; growth and F&#8321; folding. An even earlier period of pre-S&#8321; fabric formation mainly defined by white mica, biotite and ilmenite, is not related to any visible folding and may either represent an earlier discrete event or an early phase of the D&#8321; event, However, as now defined, minerals outlining this pre-S&#8321; fabric are related to the D&#8321; event. The low, medium and high grade metamorphic zones defined in the field by biotite, andalusite and sillimanite respectively are pre-S&#8321; in age and predate F&#8321; folding. The intensity of metamorphism increases with depth so that there is a broad depth control on metamorphism. Relations at the andalusite/sillimanite isograd conform to a Carmichael (1969) type model and reactions took place via an intermediate sericite phase. The main effect of F&#8321; folding is the formation of the variably plunging variably oriented Kantappa - Lakes Nob Syncline of regional extent. Only the western limb of this fold is now visible over much of its length. This fold deforms existing metamorphic zones and thus controls the relationship of low, medium and high grade rocks in this part of the Willyama Complex. The orientation of this syncline changes from vertical in the low grade rock to inclined at depth. The western limb becomes overturned at depth so that subsequent folds are downward facing. There is also a change in fold tightness with depth - from open-tight in the low grades to tight-isoclinal in the high grades, and this is accompanied by a change in S&#8320;/S&#8321;  relations (from core to limb area) from non parallel to parallel. These changes are coupled with a rotation of extension direction (mass transfer direction) from subvertical to inclined and may be explained by original formation and subsequent modification of upright F&#8321; folds. Later modifications are recorded by open folding and overturning of S&#8321; - this is ascribed to a final phase of the D&#8321; event. Mineral growth in D&#8321; time resulted in the formation of S&#8321; varying in grade from muscovite + quartz to sillimanite. S&#8321; varies from homogeneous to layered, and in the latter case, consists of M + QM layers,the spacing of which is controlled by F&#8321; microfolding. S&#8321; formation involved rotation, mass transfer, and volume decrease in M layers and (re) crystallisation. The D&#8322; event in this area was of only minor significance. The D&#8323;  event developed in response to NW-SE shortening and resulted in the formation of variably plunging, vertical northeast trending folds. Where SW plunging, these folds lie subparallel to L&#8321;. The nature of the D&#8323;  event is controlled to a large extent by S&#8320; / S&#8321; relations and folding of S&#8321; across unfolded S&#8320; occurs where S&#8320; lies parallel to the XY plane of the D&#8323;  event. S&#8323;  formed as a muscovite + quartz schistosity by rotation, re crystallisation, mass transferand mimetic growth. During the final stages of the D&#8323;  event, north-east trending retrograde schist zones were formed. These were later reactivated during the folding of the Adelaidean. The final phase of the Olarian Orogeny consists of minor D&#8324; folding and crenulation.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology, rocks, metamorphic rocks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47738</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating controversy: sex education and the Christian Right in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Sally</field><field name="description">In 2003 a panic was created about the introduction of a new model of sex education in South Australia known as the Sexual Health and Relationships Education (SHARE) project. This thesis explores the particular circumstances and conditions that enabled the SHARE project to emerge as a public problem in South Australia in 2003. It does this through analyzing the similarities and differences between the campaign against SHARE and others that have taken place against sex education in Australia and the US since the 1980s in terms of the organisations involved, the strategies used and the fears/moral panics invoked and evoked. I use the controversy created against the SHARE project as a starting point, not only to produce an historical account of a particular event in sex education in Australia but also to contribute to an understanding of the power dynamics that govern sexuality locally and in a broader global context. The methodological approach used in this thesis includes an analysis of &#8216;local discursivities&#8217; relating to the SHARE project and the genealogy of those discourses. Following Foucault and queer and feminist applications of his work, the thesis particularly explores how discourses relating to &#8216;homosexuality&#8217; and &#8216;child abuse&#8217; were deployed in the campaign against the SHARE project. The thesis then identifies alternative discourses and approaches that can strengthen sex education programs in Australia based on the lessons learnt from the campaign against the SHARE project. To assist my analysis of the controversy about the SHARE project interviews were conducted with other educators who have produced sex education resources in Australia. These revealed that while there has been some opposition to sex education in Australia over the last 20 years this has not been well organised or sustained. The campaign against the SHARE project therefore represents a unique event in the history of sex education in Australia. The thesis argues that one major contributing factor to this event is the strengthening of the relationship between conservative political parties and evangelical activist groups in Australia and their use of tactics and materials developed by Christian Right groups in the United States. The thesis analyses the implications of this religious activism within the context of current Australian politics and assesses whether the &#8216;family values&#8217; discourse, which was central to the controversy created about the SHARE project, is positioned any differently as a result of the recent changes in political leadership in Australia and the United States.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sex education; religion; politics; homosexuality; child abuse</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60564</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Treatment retention in methadone maintenance programs in Indonesia: towards evidence-informed drug policy.</field><field name="creator">Sarasvita, Riza</field><field name="description">Indonesia has been implementing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) since January 2003 as a strategy to minimize HIV transmission among injecting drug users (IDU). Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of the program and also showed that the program had attracted many IDU to participate. However, the dropout rate, particularly in Jakarta clinics, was relatively high. The first aim of this study was to investigate the MMT retention rate and its predictive variables. The second aim was to examine the effects of remaining in the program on treatment outcomes. A six-month longitudinal prospective cohort study was conducted at the client level and a cross-sectional survey was carried out at the clinic level. Information from this study provides significant inputs for developing drug treatment policy and improving its quality of service in Indonesia. It also contributes to a better understanding of the substitution treatment implementation in Indonesia. The average 3-month treatment retention rate was 74.2 percent and the 6-month retention rate was 61.3 percent. There was no significant difference in retention rates between clinics. Significant predictors of treatment retention in MMT in Indonesia were size of dose, the interaction between take-home dose and clinic experience, age of participant, participant&#8217;s belief towards the program and perceived accessibility, while a variable representing perceived peer support unexpectedly predicted an increased likelihood of prematurely leaving the treatment. This study showed a marked reduction in the use of heroin and depression status and a significant improvement of self-efficacy at the follow up times among participants who continued in treatment. There were no significant differences in criminal involvement and physical health status between those who remained in treatment and the treatment dropouts in both follow-up interviews. Nevertheless, there was a significant improvement in physical health from baseline to follow-up in both groups. The study concluded that retention rates of MMT in Indonesia were comparable to those of similar programs in other countries. As previously reported in other settings, dose was the primary predictor of treatment retention in Indonesia. A policy of providing take-home doses, prescribed in experienced clinics,was also found to be a significant predictor of remaining in treatment. Further research, however, is still needed to explain some of the unexpected observations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">methadone maintenance treatment; treatment retention; predictive variable</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60565</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of CO2 and green-house gases (GHG) miscibility and interactions with oil to enhance the oil recovery in gas flooding processes.</field><field name="creator">Emera, Mohammed Kamal</field><field name="description">1. Objective: The objective of this research has been to develop more reliable models to predict the miscibility and interactions between CO&#8322; or green-house gas (GHG) and oil (dead and live oils) over a wider range of conditions, based on data from different site sources, considering all the major variables affecting each modelled parameter, and for different injected gas compositions. The Genetic algorithm (GA), an artificial intelligence technique based on the Darwinian theory of evolution that mimics some of the natural processes in living organisms, was used to develop these models, based on GA software that has been developed in this work (as a modelling technique). While applications of GA have been used recently in the mathematical and computer sciences, its applications in the petroleum engineering, especially EOR research, have been limited.  2. Motivation to Investigate the Potential of GA-based Models: The detrimental effects of CO&#8322; and/or GHG emissions from various industrial and human/activity sources on the environment are a major concern worldwide. This has resulted in an intensive global R&amp;D effort to lower or mitigate the damaging impact of GHG on the environment. One potentially attractive and effective means of lowering the GHG emissions could be to capture them from their major sources of emissions and then sequester them in depleted oil and gas reservoirs while also enhancing oil recovery. Typically, a GHG stream, also referred to as "flue gas", contains high percentages of CO&#8322; in addition to other gases, notably, N&#8322;, NO&#8339; and SO&#8339;. The presence of high CO&#8322; content in the flue gas, in particular, could make this option potentially viable, provided the miscibility and interaction properties between the injected gas and reservoir fluids are favorable. Therefore, it is critical to ascertain the likely miscibility and interactions parameters between the injected gas (CO&#8322; or flue gas) and oil at different conditions to determine the optimal miscibility and interaction conditions that contribute to oil viscosity reduction and oil swelling. They in turn enhance oil recovery through improved gas flooding process performance due to higher oil mobility, volumetric sweep efficiency, and relative permeability to oil. Often miscibility and interactions between injected gases and oils are established through "experimental methods", "new mathematical models" based on phase equilibria data and equations of state (EOS), and available "published models". Experimental methods are time-consuming and costly. Moreover, they can handle only limited conditions. Mathematical models require availability of a considerable amount of reservoir fluid composition data, which may not be available most of the time. Although, the published models are simpler and faster to use, one must however recognise that most of these models were developed and validated based on limited data ranges from site-specific conditions. Therefore, their applications cannot be generic. Another noteworthy point is that most of the interactions models have been developed using dead oil data and pure CO&#8322; as an injected gas. Hence, they do not perform well for a wider range of live oils, as well as injected flue gases, which contain different components besides CO&#8322;. Consequently, there is a need to have more reliable miscibility and interaction models, which can handle a much wider range of conditions and different data sources. Also, these models should be able to consider all the major variables, different injected gas compositions, and live oil in addition to dead oil. 3. GA-based Models Developed in This Research: -- GA-based model for more reliable prediction of minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) between reservoir oil and CO&#8322;: This model recognised the major variables affecting MMP (reservoir temperature, MWc&#8325;&#8330; , and volatiles and intermediates compositions). It has been successfully validated with published experimental data and compared to common models in the literature. It is noted that GA-based CO&#8322;-oil MMP offered the best match with the lowest error and standard deviation. -- GA-based flue gas-oil MMP model: For this model, the MMP was regarded as a function of the injected gas solubility into oil, which in turn is related to the injected gas critical properties (pseudocritical temperature and pressure) besides reservoir temperature and oil composition. A critical temperature modification factor was also used in developing this model. The GA-based model has also been successfully validated against published experimental data and compared to several models in the literature. It yielded the best match with the lowest average error and standard deviation. Moreover, unlike other models, it can be used more reliably for gases with higher N&#8322; (up to 20 mole%) and different non-CO&#8322; components (e.g., H&#8322;S, N&#8322;, SO&#8339;, O&#8322;, and C&#8321;-C&#8324;) with higher ratio (up to 78 mole%). -- GA-based CO&#8322;-oil physical properties models: These models have been developed to predict CO&#8322; solubility, impact on the oil swelling factor, CO&#8322;-oil density, and CO&#8322;-oil viscosity for both dead and live oils. These models recognised the major variables that affect each physical property and also properly address the effects of CO2 liquefaction pressure and oil molecular weight (MW). These models have been successfully validated with published experimental data and have been compared against several widely used models. The GA-based CO&#8322;-oil properties models yielded more accurate predictions with lower errors than other models that have been tested. Furthermore, unlike the other tested models, which are applicable to only limited data ranges and conditions, GA-based models can be applied over a wider data range and conditions. -- GA-based flue gas-oil physical properties models: These models predict flue gas-oil properties such as, flue gas solubility, impact on the oil swelling factor, and flue gas-oil density and viscosity while recognising all the major variables affecting each property. Also, the GA-based models recognised the different injected flue gas compositions. These models have been successfully validated with published experimental data and have also been compared against other commonly reported CO&#8322;-oil models, which are often used for flue gas-oil physical properties prediction. The GA-based models consistently yielded a lower prediction error than the models that have been tested. Furthermore, unlike other models, which are applicable only over limited data ranges and conditions, GA-based models can be valid over a wider range of data under various conditions. All the above-mentioned models, developed in this research, are particularly useful when experimental data are lacking and the project financial situation is a concern. In addition, these models can be useful as a fast track gas flooding project screening guide. Also, they can easily be incorporated into a reservoir simulator for CO&#8322; or flue gas flooding design and simulation. Furthermore, they can serve as yet another useful tool to design optimal and economical experimental test protocols to  etermine the miscibility and interactions between the injected CO&#8322; or flue gas and oils in gas flooding processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60566</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Xray diffraction Study of a diterpene</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Bryan Frederick</field><field name="description">The diterpene hydrocarbon rimuene has exercised over the years, the interest of a number of laboratories engaged in natural product research. As is usual with this class of compound its occurrence is confined almost entirely to the native New Zealand flora and although only two types of tree have been used as sources, it has been identified, often only in small amounts, in at least ten different species. Its co-occurrence with other diterpenes of similar chemical and physical properties has often made it hard to isolate and this, together with its geographic distribution has probably tended to limit its availability for research purposes, and hence delayed the elucidation of its structure. The awareness of the existence of this compound of undetermined structure has, therefore, caused a noticable gap in the knowledge of the diterpenoids, and this hiatus has been accentuated by Wenkert who, believing it to have a pimarane skeleton, suggested that it might be the important biogenetic precursor of a number of tetracyclic diterpenoids. Recent work, confirmed by the present investigation has, however, shown that previous structural predictions were incorrect and in actual fact rimuene has a rosane skeleton. As Ruzicka has shown for this class of compound, it has probably been formed from a pimarane diterpenoid and therefore represents a later biogenetic step than the other diterpene hydrocarbons which are always found with it in nature.</field><field name="date">1967</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2593</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed. Analytic concepts&#8212; such as forced migration, cultural bereavement, adaptation, integration, diaspora, transnationalism, identification, and community of practice&#8212; are used to trace the trajectory of the contemporary way of life of Cambodians, their community development, and their cultural identity. The data gathered from mixedmethod research reveal the various opinions, strategies, coping mechanisms, and paths that Cambodian participants have adopted in order to adapt to life in New Zealand and still maintain their Khmer heritage. The majority of participants were proud of their personal achievements, and now have found normalcy in their new life. Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand). Key words: Cambodian refugees, forced migration, adaptation, integration, transnationalism, Buddhism, Khmer identity, community development, and community of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life history and demography of the pipi, Paphies australis (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Simon Holloway.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life history characteristics of the New Zealand pipi (Paphies australis) from gametogenesis, through spawning, larval development, settlement, juvenile recruitment patterns, distribution and abundance patterns, population size structure and growth characteristics from the Whangateau Harbour, in northeastern New Zealand. The thesis concludes by integrating this information into a model, based on hydrographic information and post settlement movement in order to help explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance of juvenile and adult pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. The temporal pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was investigated over two years (May 1991 - April 1993). Samples of pipi gonads were processed using standard histological techniques, and the resultant sections placed into six developmental categories (early active, late active, mature, partially spawned and indeterminate). Gametogenesis was similar in both years, beginning in autumn with most pi pi in early active stages of development. By late winter many pipi were mature. Spawning commenced in early spring and continued through spring and summer. From a sample of 104 pi pi collected in spring 1992 for investigation into the length at sexual maturity, all pipi were found to be sexually mature above 40 mm shell length, but some individuals between 30-40 mm also had gonads with sex cells present. This sample had a sex ratio significantly biased towards females. Further analysis revealed that juveniles (below 40 mm shell length) had a significantly higher proportion of females than males, but adults (above 40 mm shell length) had a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. No evidence of hermaphroditism was observed. The spatial pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was also investigated over one year (February 1992 to January 1993) at three subtidal sites using the same techniques as for the temporal study, but with one further category (parasitised). The reproductive cycle was similar between sites, with an extended spawning period . of late winter to summer. It was concluded that the reproductive cycle of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour was synchronised at all three sites sampled. A visual maturity index gave the same overall pattern of reproductive cycle as the histological analysis, but was found to be inaccurate mainly due to a poor recognition of the mature stages. It was concluded that the visual index was of limited value in accurately assessing the maturity of an individual. The sex ratio of adult pipi was not significantly different from 1: 1. A small percentage (0.87%) of pi pi were infected by a digenetic trematode fluke that, in most cases, totally castrated the individual. The larval development of pipi was described from larval culture experiments. Pi pi were conditioned, spawned and the resultant larvae reared to settlement in the laboratory. Adult pipi were successfully conditioned after 23 days at 22&#176;C. Spawning was accomplished using a combination of increased temperature and a dilute sperm solution. Settlement occurred 18-22 days after spawning at a mean shell length of 264 Ilm . After settlement and metamorphosis pi pi gradually began to take on the adult shape. Cultured juveniles were grown to 37 mm shell length both in the laboratory and later in the wild. Once in the wild, cultured pipi grew from 13 mm to 37 mm in 17 months with a strong seasonal component to their growth. Microscopic examination revealed slight differences in shell morphology between pi pi larvae and the closely related tuatua (Paphies subtriangu/ata) and toheroa (Paphies ventricosa). Pi pi were more rounded and smaller than both tuatua and toheroa at a similar stage of development. The results of scanning electron microscope examination of larval shell hinge structure confirmed previous preliminary findings for pipi. The larval shell ligament is posterior to the centre of the provinculum in pipi but central in both the tuatua and toheroa. These differences are sufficient to enable larval pipi to be distinguished from larval toheroa and tuatua. The spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of pipi were measured from November 1991 to January 1994. Previous information had suggested that pipi were a mainly intertidal species, but this study found that they can occur in large numbers subtidally. Temporal sampling was carried out by systematically measuring the abundance of pipi found within three subtidal grids. Abundances were compared within and between the grids. The subtidal population was extremely dense (up to 4400 m-2 ), with well defined boundaries. Pipi densities at the edges of the beds dropped from many hundreds to zero m-2 within 2 to 3 m. Large numbers of juvenile pi pi &#171;30 mm) were present at the start of sampling and the density of these decreased during the sampling period. Juvenile pipi occurred at high density at the harbour entrance site, but were rare or absent at the other two sites further up the harbour. Small scale distribution (ie. within a grid) at the harbour entrance showed high variability which was linked to large swells from storms, observed only at this site. The advantages of systematic sampling compared with random or haphazard sampling are discussed. The population size structure, growth and small scale movement patterns of pipi, were also studied. Pi pi formed a continuous bed from the harbour entrance up the main subtidal channel, and extended approximately one kilometre upstream. Pi pi had different shell morphologies at different sites within the harbour, and population size structure differed among sites. Small pi pi were found at either end of the subtidal pi pi bed but were absent from the middle. Analysis of length-frequency distributions indicated that there had been a large recruitment of pipi prior to the commencement of the study, but little further recruitment occurred during 1992 to 1994. Pipi took approximately three to four years to reach the population maximum size of 55-60 mm shell length. Tagged pipi, constrained in suspended nets grew more slowly than predicted from population length-frequency analysis, but tagged pi pi that were returned to the sediment grew as predicted. Localised movement of tagged pipi showed that pi pi gradually move into the centre (deeper part) of the channel and towards the harbour entrance. Adult and juvenile pipi, were observed drifting in mid-water, in the Whangateau Harbour. The animals were buoyed up by the secretion of long mucus threads which extended out through their siphons. Quantitative information from netting experiments over a period of five months from May 1993 to September 1993, collected a total of 509 drifting pipi. These were mainly juveniles &#171;15 mm shell length) but a small number of adults (up to 58 mm shell length) were also collected. The numbers of pi pi caught was highly variable, however, there was a trend for more drifting pipi to be caught on the flood tide (n=386) than the ebb tide (n=123). Overall there was little difference in the number of pipi caught between spring (n=263) and neap tides (n=246), however, this was heavily influenced by one neap tide in May 1993 (n=207). Three other bivalve species (So/etellina sp, Gari stangeri, Macomona . lilliana) were also caught drifting. Pipi were also observed to attach themselves to debris, such as dead branches of trees, which then moved them with the tidal currents. Large epiphytic algal growths on the shell also acted to buoy individuals which moved them around in tidal currents. It is hypothesised that mucus drifting in pipi is an active process, adopted for movement to other areas triggered by very high densities (over 4000 m2 ) in the harbour entrance. Finally, the distribution and size structure of the pi pi population was described by a simple model, based on the post-settlement movement of pi pi and tidal current patterns. Pipi recruits &#171;5 mm shell length) were found to be largely restricted to a small strip, mid-intertidally in clean coarse sediments. Juvenile pi pi (5-35 mm) were found at a low intertidal site directly downstream of the recruitment site. Further downstream of this site, at a subtidal site at the harbour entrance both juvenile and adult pi pi were found. A similar population size structure was found at the innermost extent of the pi pi bed in the main channel. Adult pi pi were abundant in the central part of the pi pi bed, but no juveniles were found at this site. It was concluded that post-settlement movement patterns could account for the distribution patterns of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. If subsequently found to be of more general applicability, this model provides a powerful, predictive tool for managing pipi population and possibly other infaunal clams. This study provides, for the first time, a detailed description of the distribution and abundance of an entire pipi population from one harbour. This information allows a more informed management of pi pi populations around New Zealand. It also provides a framework in which more indepth questions about the ecology of pipi populations (and other bivalve populations) can be more clearly addressed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5758</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Methods for Improving Scalability and Playability of Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG)</field><field name="creator">Prasetya, Kusno</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a combination of solutions to improve scalability and playability of MMOGs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet games</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/34</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Otahuhu B Power Station condenser in-leakage analysis and condensate monitoring system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Electronics Engineering at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Heng</field><field name="description">Considerable ongoing risk of condenser in-leakage exists at Otahuhu B (OTB) Power Station. The condenser cooling water used at OTB station is corrosive brackish water with exceedingly high sodium and chloride concentrations. Significant signs of corrosion inside the condenser have been found recently. In the event of condenser in-leakage, the salt contaminants in the cooling water will directly enter the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) with the potential for significant and costly damage resulting in a long plant outage. A dynamic mathematical model was developed in the thesis to analyse the consequences of condenser in-leakage at OTB station. The analysis results show that the tolerance of the condenser to any leakage of cooling water is almost zero. Because the existing condensate monitoring system is not designed to detect contamination in this time frame, a new fast response system is required to detect condenser in-leakage immediately. A new dedicated fast response condensate monitoring system has been engineered and installed at OTB station as a part of the project scope. The new system dramatically reduces the response time to condenser in-leakage events. Critical instruments utilise multiple redundancy schemes to enhance the availability and reliability of the system. In addition, action level voting, timing, and alarming has been automated to assist operators in making correct decisions. The new condensate monitoring system is presently fully functional. The project has successfully achieved the objective of controlling the risk of condenser in-leakage events and minimising damage and negative effects on the plant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corrosion</field><field name="subject">condensate monitoring system</field><field name="subject">cooling water</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290903 Other electronic engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/950</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of field techniques to predict soil carbon, soil nitrogen and root density from soil spectral reflectance : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kusumo, Bambang Hari</field><field name="description">The objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate a field method for in situ measurement of soil properties using visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS). A probe with an independent light source for acquiring soil reflectance spectra from soil cores was developed around an existing portable field spectrometer (ASD FieldSpecPro, Boulder, CO, USA; 350-2500 nm). Initial experiments tested the ability of the acquired spectra to predict plant root density, an important property in soil carbon dynamics. Reflectance spectra were acquired from soil containing ryegrass roots (Lolium multiflorum) grown in Allophanic and Fluvial Recent soils in a glasshouse pot trial. Differences in root density were created by differential nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to calibrate spectral data (pre-processed by smoothing and transforming spectra to the first derivative) against laboratory-measured root density data (wet-sieve technique). The calibration model successfully predicted root densities (r2 = 0.85, RPD = 2.63, RMSECV = 0.47 mg cm-3) observed in the pots to a moderate level of accuracy. This soil reflectance probe was then tested using a soil coring system to acquire reflectance spectra from two soils under pasture (0-60 mm soil depths) that had contrasting root densities. The PLSR calibration models for predicting root density were more accurate when soil samples from the two soils were separated rather than grouped. A more accurate prediction was found in Allophanic soils (r2 = 0.83, RPD = 2.44, RMSECV = 1.96 mg g-1) than in Fluvial Recent soils (r2 = 0.75, RPD = 1.98, RMSECV = 5.11 mg g-1). The Vis-NIRS technique was then modified slightly to work on a soil corer that could be used to measure root contents from deeper soil profiles (15- 600 mm depth) in arable land (90-day-old maize crop grown in Fluvial Recent soils). PLSR calibration models were constructed to predict the full range of maize root densities (r2 = 0.83, RPD = 2.42, RMSECV = 1.21 mg cm-3) and also soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations that had been determined in the laboratory (LECO FP- 2000 CNS Analyser; Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI, USA). Further studies concentrated on improving the Vis-NIRS technique for prediction of total C and N concentrations in differing soil types within different soil orders in the field. The soil coring method used in the maize studies was evaluated in permanent and recent pastoral soils (Pumice, Allophanic and Tephric Recent in the Taupo-Rotorua Volcanic Zone, North Island) with a wide range of soil organic matter contents resulting from different times (1-5 years) since conversion from forest soils. Without any sample preparation, other than the soil surface left after coring, it was possible to predict soil C and N concentrations with moderate success (C prediction r2 = 0.75, RMSEP = 1.23%, RPD = 1.97; N prediction r2 = 0.80, RMSEP = 0.10%, RPD = 2.15) using a technique of acquiring soil reflectance spectra from the horizontal cross-section of a soil core (H method). The soil probe was then modified to acquire spectra from the curved vertical wall of a soil core (V method), allowing the spectrometer&#8217;s field of view to increase to record the reflectance features of the whole soil sample taken for laboratory analysis. Improved predictions of soil C and N concentrations were achieved with the V method of spectral acquisition (C prediction r2 = 0.97, RMSECV = 0.21%, RPD = 5.80; N prediction r2 = 0.96, RMSECV = 0.02%, RPD = 5.17) compared to the H method (C prediction r2 = 0.95, RMSECV = 0.27%, RPD = 4.45; N prediction r2 = 0.94, RMSECV = 0.03%, RPD = 4.25). The V method was tested for temporal robustness by assessing its ability to predict soil C and N concentrations of Fluvial Recent soils under permanent pasture in different seasons. When principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ensure that the spectral dimensions (which were responsive to water content) of the data set used for developing the PLSR calibration model embraced those of the &#8220;unknown&#8221; soil samples, it was possible to predict soil C and N concentrations in &#8220;unknown&#8221; samples of widely different water contents (in May and November), with a high level of accuracy (C prediction r2 = 0.97, RMSEP = 0.36%, RPD = 3.43; N prediction r2 = 0.95, RMSEP = 0.03%, RPD = 3.44). This study indicates that Vis-NIRS has considerable potential for rapid in situ assessment of soil C, N and root density. The results demonstrate that field root densities in pastoral and arable soil can be predicted independently from total soil C, which will allow researchers to predict C sequestration from root production. The recommended &#8220;V&#8221; technique can be used to assess spatial and temporal variability of soil carbon and nitrogen within soil profiles and across the landscape. It can also be used to assess the rate of C sequestration and organic matter synthesis via root density prediction. It reduces the time, labour and cost of conventional soil analysis and root density measurement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil properties</field><field name="subject">soil carbon dynamics</field><field name="subject">root density</field><field name="subject">in situ assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1015</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Un i form "consisting of one" : a written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clement, Julie</field><field name="description">Uni form is an exploration into the act of getting dressed.

In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parasitism, disease and breeding ecology of little blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) on Tiritiri Matangi Island, New Zealand : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Jansen van Rensburg, Monique</field><field name="description">Appendix 4.4 removed due to copyright restrictions: Suepaul, R.B., Alley, M.R., Jansen van Rensburg, M., 2010, Salt gland adenitis associated with bacteria in blue penguins (Eudyptula minor) from Hauraki Gulf (Auckland, New Zealand).

Schoenewolf (1990) describes emotional contagion as &#8220;a process in which a person or group influences the emotions or behavior of another person or group through the conscious or unconscious induction of emotion states and behavioral attitudes&#8221; (p. 50). A significant aspect of this theory involves joint consumption. This suggests that an experience of an event differs when more than one person is involved. Ramanathan and McGill&#8217;s (2007) recent study suggests that a stronger positive or negative evaluation of a shared experience is achieved through the creation of emotional contagion. When considering this, an opportunity exists to establish recommendations for the design industry to employ in order to enhance an audience&#8217;s response. In order to be successful in constructing a pertinent strategy it is critical to consider the way in which people perceive experiences; central to this theme are the five senses. Research into the five senses which include sight, sound, smell, touch and taste, indicates the significant impact over an individuals&#8217; emotions and decision making process. To date the human senses have been largely neglected within the design industry due to conventional use of mainstream media. Through using non-traditional media, participants could be connected on a more sensory level through means of interactive involvement. From a holistic perspective the overarching methodology will be that of research for design (Frayling, 1993, as cited in Downtown, 2003). The emphasis will therefore be on providing insights and ideas as to how the design industry could, through non-traditional media, embrace emotional contagion. Supporting methods will be a combination of the following: 1. Case studies. These will include an analysis of precedents 2. A self generated design campaign. The focus will be tourism. This has been chosen because of its experiential and shared nature.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="subject">Communication design</field><field name="subject">Visual design</field><field name="subject">Theory of emotional contagion</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410201 Graphic arts studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1636</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policing the mentally ill : making sense of links in the chain of interagency collaboration in the community : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Denne, Stephanie</field><field name="description">The shift to community care through the deinstitutionalisation movement in New Zealand has been criticised for producing fragmented and uncoordinated service provision for those with mental illness in the community. As a result, the police are coming into increased contact with the mentally ill, often in times of crisis, positioning police at the junction between mental health services and the criminal justice system. Barriers to access for integrative, comprehensive mental health care in the community have led to police understanding their position as the &#8216;ambulance at the bottom of the cliff&#8217;. While previous research has attended to police officer attitudes and points of interaction with those with mental illness in the community, little has been said regarding understandings of the collaborative relationships from the vantage point of those officers policing the mentally ill. The current research sought to address this gap in the literature by exploring how police make sense of their experiences with those with mental illness in the community using a Foucaultian form of discourse analysis. The discourses that co-articulated and produced understandings of the position(s) of police in community service provision for the mentally ill and the power relationships between the police, the mental health system and the mentally ill can be understood through &#8216;links in the chain&#8217;; &#8216;the (un) identifiable other&#8217;; &#8216;no-man&#8217;s land&#8217;; &#8216;underdogs&#8217;; and &#8216;the cure&#8217;. These systems of meaning making from the police vantage point reproduced and re-institutionalised constructions of the mentally ill as &#8216;criminal&#8217; or &#8216;disordered&#8217;, necessitating mechanisms of power and control to address the &#8216;risk&#8217; mental illness posed to the community. Through such understandings the police, as society&#8217;s institutional response to &#8216;threat&#8217;, necessarily occupy the position of the &#8216;ambulance at the bottom of the cliff&#8217; at the institutional boundaries between disorder and criminality. And it is here that the institutional response to mental illness re-emerges as re-institutionalisation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mentally ill</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1637</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education for the environment : towards teacher empowerment : a thesis submitted as fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, November 2004, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chapman, David James</field><field name="description">The work of this thesis involves an exploration of teachers' practice in environmental education in New Zealand schools, conducted between 1999 and 2002. Some new theorising is conducted in response to the problems faced by teachers. This seeks to reconceptualise the way we think about environmental education in schools. The purpose of this is to provide a theoretical framework that assists teachers to rethink their practice and, as a result, be empowered to act for the environment. The thesis begins by providing a general background to the field of environmental education and by setting this in the socio-political context of New Zealand from the early 1980s until the present. The research process is described, and theorised using Problem-Based Methodology. The work then proceeds to report on the research with teachers in schools that occurred in a number of phases. It emerges that environmental education occurred in only a minority of cases. School contexts and educational structures appeared to place major barriers in the path of teacher innovation and these seem to increase with school size. Teachers that do begin sound practice appear to have strong values and a theoretical background that informs their work. In response to the complex barriers to improved environmental education practice, Problem-Based Methodology is suggested to provide an inadequate platform for addressing the issues because it is restricted to addressing micro level problems in schools. Drawing on the philosophy of critical realism that proposes three levels of reality, a Critical Problem-Based Methodology is proposed. This involves three loops of critical reflection. To support this an issues matrix that contains a sociological analysis of schooling and draws heavily on curriculum theory is developed. A reconsideration of the environmental education literature is then undertaken in the light of these proposals. The thrust of the thesis is that environmental education lacks a substantive engagement with sociology or curriculum theory and the proposals here seek to address that. It is proposed that triple loop reflection assists a better description of the problems of poor progress in the field. It is argued that many educators have a faith in schooling that is not justified by evidence and have failed to engage at a political level. It is concluded that unless engagement occurs at the three levels proposed in this thesis, and a deeper engagement with educational theory supports this, things are unlikely to change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental education</field><field name="subject">Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1638</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Who needs money when you can go windsurfing?" : the paradox of resisting consumerism through consumption in a lifestyle sport subculture : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Visual and Material Culture at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Peter Francis</field><field name="description">Lifestyle sport has become a significant sociological phenomenon, with millions participating worldwide. Using windsurfing as a case study, this thesis focuses on core members of this subculture to discover their motivations for involvement and the degree to which they are willing to sacrifice other areas of their lives in order to participate. The thesis explores the contention that this level of sacrifice amounts to resistance to the dominant consumerist culture of our society. The study examines the way subculture members manifest an embodied critique of urban experience that takes place outside of that environment in natural spaces, using time that consumerist imperatives would have them in the earn-spend spiral dictated by that ideology. It does this through a twelve month ethnographic study, with the author as a complete participant, then as a participant observer, completing formal interviews with a number of selected core members of the subculture. Through interviewing and observation it became clear that it is only possible for subculture members to participate through the consumption of considerable quantities of the material objects associated with the activity. This means that participants are resisting consumerist culture through the consumption of consumer goods. This contradiction goes to the heart of the ways that consumerist ideology co-opts resistant behaviour. The study shows that windsurfers are resistant to consumerism in a number of ways. The rejection of traditional sporting values, the use of time in opposition to dominant practices, the rejection of wealth as the primary measure of success, and resisting cultural expectations are all manifestations of this resistance. The niche visual media of the subculture creates a dreamworld of natural perfection and freedom. The way that the visual culture mediates the paradox central to my thesis is by valourising a lifestyle, and those who adopt it, rather than selling consumer goods.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Windsurfing</field><field name="subject">Consumer culture</field><field name="subject">Lifestyle sport</field><field name="subject">Subculture</field><field name="subject">Ethnographic study</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1639</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Entrepreneurship and economic development in New Zealand, 1880-1910 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in History at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Ian</field><field name="description">This study investigates entrepreneurial activity in New Zealand between 1880 and 1910. Economic indicators, population, import and export patterns, provincial differences, and industrial development are examined to understand entrepreneurship and its relationship to economic growth. In addition, a case analysis of 133 entrepreneurs is presented, which analyses the backgrounds, education, reasons for venture start-up, venture types, methods of growth, incidence of failure, and sources of capital for nineteenth-century New Zealand entrepreneurs. This study suggests that a range of structural characteristics present in the New Zealand economy at this time, such as rapid population growth, technological innovation, isolation of markets, business structures, public works investment, immigration, and fiscal policies, encouraged and fostered entrepreneurial activity. Common characteristics among those who undertook new ventures over this period are highlighted; these include skill, commercial experience, limited capital, partnership, networks and the propensity to undertake multiple business ventures. Overall, entrepreneurial activity by small and medium-sized enterprises emerged as an important mechanism by which the colonial economy expanded both in scale and scope.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand economy</field><field name="subject">Business history</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430101 History: New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1640</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of limb development and locomotion in the brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jones, Erica Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis covers broad topics concerning limb growth and development and their effects on locomotion in the brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli). I begin by describing the morphological features of a collection of unknown-age wild kiwi embryos from early development to point of hatch. Using these features, I assign developmental stages to each embryo and compare the progress of development to the same-staged ostrich and chicken embryos. Measurements of the hindlimb, bill and crown-rump length are used to develop an aging scheme based on comparisons with the ostrich and the chicken. The ostrich model and chicken model create age predictions for the unknown aged kiwi embryos. One kiwi embryo was of known age and both models gave identical predictions for this marker embryo, but gave differing predictions for all other kiwi embryos. Using captive-reared kiwi chicks, I characterise hindlimb, bill and bodyweight growth from the time of hatch to 3 months of age. Growth patterns are very linear within this time period for all measurements but bodyweight. Female kiwi hatch with longer bills than males, but the growth of both sexes converges by the end of the 3-month period. Growth of bodyweight in the males slows earlier than in females. Bodyweight and bill length were then compared to a wild population of kiwi. Captive-reared chicks were found to hatch with shorter bills than the wild birds and to increase in bodyweight at a faster rate than wild birds. Rapid weight gain has been implicated in developmental limb deformities in other precocial and long-legged birds and has the potential to produce similar results in captive kiwi. I further studied the movement of the hindlimb during locomotion in two adults and one juvenile kiwi by filming them while they were walking on a treadmill. Kinematic parameters were measured from the video recordings and compared to overground parameters from another study. Similarity between the treadmill and overground locomotor parameters validates the use of a treadmill in studying kiwi locomotion. None of the birds achieved the theoretical transition from a walk to a run at a duty factor of 0.5. After normalising for size, the juvenile showed a longer stride length and lower stride frequency with increasing speed than the adults. Lateral head oscillations were observed during the stride cycle, which I propose having a sensory function as well as a biomechanical one.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brown kiwi</field><field name="subject">Apteryx mantelli</field><field name="subject">limb development</field><field name="subject">locomotion</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270503 Animal anatomy and histology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1641</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceptions of teacher education in relation to the teaching practicum : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Lind, Peter R.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the perceptions of the student teacher, the associate teacher and the visiting lecturer regarding the adequacy of the practicum for the preparation of the first year primary school teacher. Six triads, or case studies, comprising a student teacher, a visiting lecturer and an associate teacher were selected, each within a different school setting. Using grounded theory, the collected data were analysed and sorted until a conceptual framework emerged. Three key themes were identified: the emotional nature of the teaching practicum; the practicum as situated learning; and the practicum as a professional learning community. Each member of the triad viewed the final teaching practicum as critical to teacher preparation. To a large extent understandings of the roles played by each member of the triad had been implicit rather than explicit. This study highlighted the importance and complementarities of the roles the members of the triad play. It found that student teachers often rely on the solutions provided by the associate teacher and/or the visiting lecturer, and that they lack confidence in their own ability to solve challenging classroom problems. A professional learning community requires each member of the triad to collaborate actively as a member of the teaching team and collectively reach solutions posed in the teaching of the class. Finally, the student teachers experienced difficulty in meeting the challenges of student needs, particularly in low decile schools; for some the challenges were overwhelming. The study has implications for other initial teacher education programmes regarding practices to meaningfully bridge the gap between the classroom context and the university programme. It provides insights into the requirements for the implementation of practicum that promote a professional learning community. It challenges the assumptions teacher education providers may have about the current models of teaching practicum in which it is perceived as a site where student teachers simply practise teaching and prove their readiness to assume the mantle of a first year teacher. It contributes to the debate of the role and function of the practicum in pre-service teacher education and the need for a deeper understanding and expectation in its implementation by the university and the school, who should be viewed as professional partners in this endeavour.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teacher training</field><field name="subject">Teacher education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1642</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Neospora caninum and neosporosis in New Zealand cattle : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Okeoma, Chioma Maureen</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Okeoma, C.

An upshot of this has been higher levels of cross-border investment. Foreign direct investment (FDI), long considered an engine of growth, has led to widespread probe with its recent rapid spread. Nevertheless, while research on the contribution of FDI to host countries has concentrated heavily on the developed and developing economies, there has been a marked neglect of small, developed economies. This study proposes to focus on New Zealand, a country that falls within the latter category. The study seeks to verify econometrically the impact of FDI on the country through causality links with growth, trade, domestic investment and labour productivity. The analysis is based upon time-series data, the econometric techniques of single, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), and the multiple equations approach, vector error correction method (VECM). The study found that there have been substantial gains to the New Zealand economy. A positive effect of FDI on the variables mentioned above led to an improvement of the balance of payments through an increase in exports rather than in imports. Economic growth has mainly been achieved through FDI's impact on exports and domestic private investment. The dynamic innovation techniques indicated a bi-directional causality between FDI and the variables. The long-run causality, however, runs mainly from growth and labour productivity to FDI rather than in the opposite direction. Another noticeable feature is that New Zealand's regional agreement with Australia, Closer Economic Relations, has brought the country significant gains in terms of growth and development through FDI. Both the ARDL and VECM approaches suggest that for a small, developed country qualitative impacts are greater than quantitative ones. The policy implication is that maintaining sustainable economic growth with a positive domestic investment environment is vital for attracting foreign investors. New Zealand, while continuing to encourage inward FDI, should aim to channel it into 'innovative' tradable sectors. The challenge lies in providing the right kind of policy mix for this purpose.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Economic growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340400 Econometrics::340402 Econometric and statistical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1644</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and local governance in Indonesia : a case study of engendering local governance in North Sumatra : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies  at Massey University, Palmerston North, New zealand</field><field name="creator">Siahaan, Asima Yanty Sylvania</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to explore the complexities involved in engendering local governance and to identify strategies to encourage gender equitable partnerships between stakeholders in local governance in Third World countries. Local governance refers to the dynamic yet complicated process of interaction between state and non-state actors involved in local level development processes. Considering the invisibility of women in local governance, this study focuses heavily on women's agency, that is, the way women redefine and reconstruct identities and interactions in engendering local governance despite the given constraints. The central argument in this thesis is that engendering local governance requires transformation of structures and processes of governing at the local level so that they recognise and are responsive to differences between men and women in their values and responsibilities. Relevant institutions should then integrate these differences in policies and in managing development at the local level. Fieldwork in North Sumatra, Indonesia highlighted how the interlocking of public and private patriarchy complicates the engendering of local governance. Both within and beyond the household there are constraints put on women that impede their participation in local governance. Analysis of case studies of perwiridan (Moslem women's religious grouping), SPI (Serikat Perempuan Independen/ Union of Independent Women) and women working in local government found that relationships at the household level significantly influence gender relations in local governance. Reproduction of images of 'good' and 'bad' women is one of the most effective instruments to subordinate and control women in North Sumatra, meaning that it is not easy for women to formulate and defend their personal interests. Women often experience severe threats of physical, psychological and verbal violence when they attempt to influence formal decision making at the local level. Based on a further case study of the implementation of decentralisation, this study also found that decentralisation does not automatically bring local government closer to women due to the interweaving of structural, cultural, and financial barriers local government faces in implementing gender mainstreaming policies in North Sumatra. The intertwining of gendered structures of local government and gendered construction of the community contribute to the marginality of women in service delivery and in public decision making at the local level. This study rejects the assumption that women are passive recipients in local governance since they contribute significantly in fulfilling household and community needs and interests. Through knowledge and understanding to construction of power at the local level, women creatively produce and use alternative strategies which are based on their sexuality and traditional gender roles in challenging and transforming gender inequity at the local level and in improving the quality of everyday life. By raising women's self esteem, confidence and solidarity in reconstructing gendered relations at the household and community levels, women's grassroots organisations open up alternative arenas for political expression for women which is crucial for the realisation of good local governance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women in politics</field><field name="subject">Discrimination against women</field><field name="subject">Gender inequity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360106 Governance and representation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1645</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of economic restructuring in the Pacific with a case study of Fiji : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Department of Social Policy and Social Work, School of Social and Cultural studies, Massey University, Albany Campus, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Slatter, Claire</field><field name="description">The subject of this thesis is the politics of economic restructuring, euphemistically termed 'reform' in the Pacific. Although structural adjustment policies are essentially neoliberal economic policies, the project of global economic restructuring, and its supposed end, a global regime of free trade, is a political one in several respects. It involves the wielding of economic power over developing countries by powerful multilateral institutions, developed countries and private corporate entities to such a degree that it is considered by some to represent the disciplining/subjugating and dis-empowering of developing states. It is supported by a successfully propagated ideology that combines economic growth theories (held to be infallible), 'good governance' rhetoric (with which no-one can reasonably disagree), and new notions of equality and 'non-discrimination' - the 'level playing field' and 'national treatment, in WTO parlance (which have been enshrined in enforceable global trade rules). It entails redefining the role of the state, transferring public ownership of assets to private hands, and removing subsidies that protect domestic industries and jobs, all of which are strongly contested. Successfully implementing 'reform' is widely acknowledged to require not only 'reform champions' but also 'ownership', and thus broad acceptance and legitimacy, yet commitments to restructuring are often made by government ministers without reference at all to national parliaments. National economic summits are used to rubber stamp or legitimate policies in a fait accompli. The thesis begins by situating the global regime of structural adjustment within the political context of North-South relations in the 1970s, the debt crisis of the early 1980s, and the collapse of socialist regimes and consequent discrediting of the socialist economic model and other variants of state-led development. It shows the key role of the World Bank in advocating the neoliberal model and setting the development aid agenda, and its abdication of this lead role after 1995 in favour of the World Trade Organisation and its agenda of global trade liberalisation. The thesis then examines the origins, agents and interests behind structural reform in the island states of the Pacific before focusing on how a regional approach to achieving regional wide economic restructuring and trade liberalisation is being taken, using a regional political organisation of Pacific Island states (The Pacific Islands Forum), and regional free trade agreements. It then illustrates the path of economic restructuring embarked on by Fiji following the 1987 coups, examines the implementation of 'economic reform' concurrently with policies to advance the interests of indigenous Fijians, and discusses some of the less acknowledged dimensions of reform.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global trade</field><field name="subject">Economic reform</field><field name="subject">Economic policy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::349900 Other Economics::349901 Political economy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1646</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The legacy of prenatal exposure to alcohol : Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, the New Zealand situation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Symes, Margaret Mallinson</field><field name="description">'Alcohol', the strongest teratogen known to human-kind, is a commonly used legal drug which has the ability to cross the placenta and interfere with the development of the foetus resulting in a birth defect known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). This thesis looks at the historical knowledge base surrounding prenatal exposure to alcohol and presents the latest biomedical information available on FASD at the time of writing. The sub-discipline of medical anthropology, the associated methodology and it appropriateness for this kind of research is discussed. A historical look at the introduction and proliferation of alcohol in New Zealand from the macro-micro perspective, and James O'Connors' (1974) political modes of operation are presented, offering a broad analysis, of a dynamic political process involved with the lack of acknowledgement or action on the part of New Zealand governments. New Zealand specific research on women's drinking patterns, clinical practise and the experiences of those trying to obtain a diagnosis in regard to FASD within New Zealand are presented. Behavioural profiles pertaining to my participants' FASD charges are offered to the reader, all of which indicate serious repercussions for New Zealand society as a whole. Finally the labelling argument relating to the diagnostic terminology surrounding Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is discussed. The original contribution this thesis offers aside from being the first New Zealand anthropological PhD research on the subject of FASD surrounds education and action research. Knowledge creates empowerment and can facilitate individual change. My thesis has been a dialectical process whereby the more I learned from those care-giving for FASD individuals, the more I have been able to feed back to others and act in my capacity as a critical medical anthropologist, using action anthropology as a means to advocate for families affected by FASD, those whose voices of expertise by way of experience, are seldom if ever heard or listened too [sic].</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fetal alcohol syndrome</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370301 Biological (physical) anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1647</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of factors responsible for boar testicular hypertrophy following neonatal hemicastration</field><field name="creator">Mr Reece Wells</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159350</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-interpreting Modern Chinese Art: An Analysis of Three Women Artists In Twentieth-Century China (Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen)</field><field name="creator">Hwee Leng Teo</field><field name="description">There have been only sporadic attempts to highlight Chinese women&#8217;s role and influence in art, even though their contribution has been major. This thesis seeks to understand the significance of women&#8217;s participation in modern Chinese art history through the narratives and works of Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen, who were professionally active at different political stages of twentieth-century China. Using an interdisciplinary framework, drawing on concepts from theories such as modernism, feminism and postcolonialism, this thesis analyzes a culturally specific field in art history and the interrelationship between various factors that have contributed to it. As artists of a peripheral culture, various factors in the artistic production of Chinese women have been overlooked and often misinterpreted. This thesis argues that the three artists in this study have produced different, individualized responses to the Euro-American model of modernism. To highlight the cultural specificity of China, the introductory chapter will include a short comparative analysis between Chinese modernism and the modernisms of other Asian countries. The adoption of Western art forms by early overseas-trained Chinese artists such as Pan indicates as many intricacies and ambivalences as in the complex relationship of China with Western imperialism. Chapter Two situates the Westernized works of Pan in the context of Chinese modernism, pre-feminism and the semi-colonized state of early twentieth-century China. In relation to the theories of orientalism and provincialism, implications of the ambiguities of Pan&#8217;s representations are extended to debates that explore the subjectivity and identity of non-European artists in their quest for modernism. Nie Ou was born into the era when the Chinese Communists had just taken over in 1949. Under the autocratic rule of the Communists, Nie was exiled to the northern countryside during her early adulthood as part of the &#8220;re-educating the elite&#8221; program. Chapter Three demonstrates how Nie successfully emerged from the repercussions of the Cultural Revolution. During this period of intensified Chinese nationalism, Nie found ways to merge the influences of the restrictive style of Socialist Realism and the poetic Chinese literati painting tradition to create an individualized style of representation. China underwent rapid modernization in the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter Four examines the works of contemporary artist Yin Xiuzhen who, with her avant-garde installations, has pushed the boundaries of what constitutes conventional Chinese art. This chapter analyzes Yin&#8217;s works in the context of late twentieth-century China, where the nation was no longer a Socialist monolith but a complex amalgam in which old and new, Socialist and capitalist, modern and postmodern co-existed. Yin&#8217;s works will be studied in relation to theories of postmodernism, postfeminism and globalism. Chapter Five consolidates the earlier chapters by reflecting on how various conditions throughout the twentieth century have changed and shaped the role of women in Chinese art history. The concluding chapter will consider the influence Chinese women artists may have on the art discourse in China today, and perhaps across other cultures. This chapter will explore the constraints upon them and the potential of their future role, not only in China but also in the broader sense of what it means to be an artist internationally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Chinese culture, Chinese women artists, feminism, postcolonialism, modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204084</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF TOXIC CATIONS ON BACTERIAL CELLULOSE PECTIN COMPOSITES USED AS CELL WALL ANALOGS</field><field name="creator">Brigid Mckenna</field><field name="description">In strongly acidic soils (pH &lt;4.5) aluminium (Al) becomes soluble in quantities that can lead to Al phytotoxicity. It is estimated that approximately 30 % of the worlds&#8217; potentially arable lands are acidic, with Al toxicity the most limiting factor for plant growth on acid soils. With increasing use of marginal land in cropping systems, this area could reach 70 %. Cell wall pectin provides up to 70 % of the root cation exchange capacity. Pectin is suggested to control a number of physiological properties of the plant cell wall such as porosity, charge density, microfibril spacing and pH. The ability of pectin to bind cations is not only important for the uptake of nutrients but is implicated in metal toxicity, in particular Al. Despite over a century of research, the mechanisms of Al toxicity are yet to be fully elucidated or agreed upon. Gluconacetobacter xylinus is a gram-negative, soil dwelling bacterium which produces extracellular cellulose. It is an established archetype for the study of cellulose biogenesis. In the presence of pectin in the growth medium, the bacterium can form cellulose-pectin composites. Recently, the bacterium has been used to form composites as model cell walls to understand plant cell wall deposition. Additionally, bacterial cellulose composites in their natural hydrated state mimic the hydration state of primary plant cell walls. The aim of this project was to attempt to incorporate this novel cell wall analog into laboratory investigations into metal interactions with plant cell walls. Preliminary work was undertaken to optimise the bacterial culture medium, growth conditions, analysis of the composites and developing an overall general methodology. The medium buffering system was altered, growth under non-optimal pH conditions was evaluated and Al was successfully incorporated into the composites. Appropriate sample preparation for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the composites was determined. This work resulted in the successful production of bacterial cellulose-pectin composites with 30 % w/w pectin incorporation. The effect of Al on the tensile properties of the composites was examined. Aluminium had no effect on the stress/strain profiles, confirming the hypothesis that pectin is not the main load bearing component of the cell wall. The composites were used to investigate the effects of Al and other trace metals (copper (Cu), gadolinium (Gd), lanthanum (La), ruthenium (Ru) and scandium (Sc)) on the hydraulic conductivity of the composites. Hydraulic conductivity was reduced to &#8776; 30 % of the initial flow rate by 39 &#956;M Al and 0.6 Cu &#956;M, &#8776; 40 % by 4.6 &#956;M La, 3 &#956;M Sc and 4.4 &#956;M Ru, and &#8776; 55 % by 3.4 &#956;M Gd. These metal concentrations were selected based on the concentrations causing a 50 % reduction in root elongation in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.). This study demonstrated that all the trace metals caused a similar decrease of hydraulic conductivity, despite the different concentrations of the metals used. Scanning electron microscopy showed changes in pectin porosity with metal binding which may account for the decreases in hydraulic conductivity observed. As the composites could not be used as a model material in all investigations, pectin-only systems were employed in a rheological study to investigate the effect of increasing concentrations of Al, Ca, Cu or La at pH 4 on pectin (degree of esterification 30 %, 1 % w/v) gel physical strength. Comparing similar saturation levels, La formed the weakest gel, followed by Ca, which was similar to Al, while the strength of Cu gels was almost an order of magnitude stronger than the other cations. This study was the first to investigate Al and La pectate gel strength. The swelling of the gels also varied, with Ca gels being the most swollen. Pectin was also used to determine the exchange selectivity of Al, Cu, Gd, La, Ru and Sc toward Ca pectate. The order of selectivity was found to be Sc&gt;Gd&gt;La&gt;Cu&gt;Ru&gt;Al. There were some parallels between this sequence and the rhizotoxicity data of the metals, suggesting that the strength with which metals bind to pectin is an indication of their rhizotoxicity. Through the use of synthetic pectate gel systems new information was discovered about the strength of pectin gels and the selectivity of trace metals towards pectin. These findings were in keeping with those of a number of related studies, as well as with studies of plant root tissue. Overall, the novel bacterial cellulose-pectin cell wall analog was successfully integrated into research into Al and other metal toxicity in plants, and offers a useful system that can overcome some of the difficulties encountered when using plant cell wall tissue. Further research may be warranted on manipulating the growth system to produce composites in the presence of the metal (ie. metal added to the growth medium), as opposed to post-formation treatments. Moreover, the production of a three way composite of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin would likely be another useful analog for plant cell wall material.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">cell wall</field><field name="subject">bacterial cellulose</field><field name="subject">aluminium</field><field name="subject">metals</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">roots</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211503</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing a safety-based risk control effectiveness score as an alternative to conventional acceptable risk analysis and evaluation methods</field><field name="creator">Stephen Lawson</field><field name="description">Risk analysis using likelihood or probability and consequence (L x C) is prone to both methodological and application errors. This contributes to difficulties in achieving risk reduction. As an alternative to the L x C model, this study reviews risk and control effectiveness within the Australian extractive minerals industry. It draws on existing models, locally and internationally, and their application in other industry contexts. The study contends that control effectiveness is more useful and beneficial than L x C alone in determining &#8216;acceptable&#8217; risk. This hypothesis is substantiated by the development of an alternative model, Major Accident Control Analysis (MACA), based around the prevention of fatalities by exploring and quantifying the following control parameters: 1) controls pre and/or post event, 2) the control type, and 3) the effectiveness of the specific control. By assigning these control parameters, discrete values, comparisons between individual &#8216;risk&#8217; scenarios and established numerical acceptability risk criteria are possible. The theoretical proposition of this research was tested using detailed case studies to highlight the flaws of conventional risk analysis and, instead, accentuate control effectiveness as a superior method for prioritising risk and determine acceptability. The results of the research demonstrate that control effectiveness, utilised by the MACA method, is particularly valuable when limited data is available to permit quantification, data is too generalised for the operating conditions and where qualitative risk estimates are insufficient and inappropriate to prevent fatalities. MACA employs mathematically valid algorithms previously not envisaged nor developed by earlier methodologies. Importantly, these algorithms enable an interchangeable conversion of control effectiveness &#8216;values&#8217; to risk &#8216;values&#8217;. Beyond the immediate findings of the research, the additional benefits of control effectiveness are multiple. The principles are suitable to the dynamic nature of the minerals industry, yet are highly adaptable and can be readily applied beyond the field of mining. The methodology could be applied to any circumstance where traditional risk analysis is typically undertaken, thus demonstrating broader application and significance. Furthermore, the methodology is compatible with, and complementary to, existing risk approaches. The intrinsic flexibility offered by this alternative method makes provision for international variations of risk criteria used to determine &#8216;acceptability&#8217;. It is thus determined that the application of control effectiveness estimation offers benefits over and beyond those currently employed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk analysis, control effectiveness evaluation, MACA, mine safety, ALARP.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211651</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Molecular Basis of Medulloblastoma: Interaction of Hedgehog and Notch Signalling in Brain Development and Cancer</field><field name="creator">Elaine Julian</field><field name="description">Brain tumours comprise about 25% of all cancers in children. Medulloblastoma &#8211; which arise in the cerebellum &#8211; are the most common and severe malignant pediatric brain tumour and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under the age of 9. Treatment of medulloblastoma remains conventional, with surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation. These measures are successful in about 60-80% of cases but treatment results in severe side effects due to its toxicity to the central nervous system. Therefore it is of utmost importance to define the signalling pathways and genetic changes involved in the formation of medulloblastoma in order to allow for better diagnosis and treatments with higher efficiency and decreased toxicity. The cell of origin for medulloblastoma is thought to be the granule neuron progenitor, a cell type arising from cerebellar stem cells of the ventricular zone. After birth granule neuron progenitors differentiate into mature granule neurons which populate the majority of the cerebellum and are crucial for its cognitive functions and motor coordination. The Hedgehog signalling pathway plays an important role in medulloblastoma generation and murine models with activated Hedgehog signalling develop medulloblastoma at high frequencies. In addition, the Notch pathway has been implicated in the generation of medulloblastoma, and interaction between the two pathways has been suggested. Inhibitors of both Hedgehog and Notch are currently in clinical trials however knowledge of possible interactions between them could lead to more effective treatment strategies. The aim of this project was to investigate the interaction of Hedgehog and Notch signalling in normal brain development and medulloblastoma. Two mouse models allowed activation of Hedgehog and inactivation of Notch signalling in granule neuron progenitors and cerebellar ventricular zone stem cells. In granule neuron progenitors canonical Notch signalling is not required and the layering and cell types of RBP-Jlox/lox;Math1-Cre cerebella appear identical to control brains. In contrast, Notch inactivation in ventricular zone stem cells with GFAP-Cre resulted in increased differentiation of stem cells into progenitor cells accompanied by an overall developmental delay in neuronal differentiation. Medulloblastoma generated by Hedgehog activation (through inactivation of the negative Hedgehog regulator Ptc1) in both cell types cannot be blocked by Notch inactivation. Furthermore, medulloblastoma of Ptc1lox/lox;RBP-Jlox/lox;GFAP-Cre and those of Ptc1lox/lox;RBP-Jlox/lox;Math1-Cre mice are identical in incidence as well as histology to the tumours in which only Hedgehog signalling is activated. This implies that even though Notch signalling plays an important role in cerebellar stem cells it is not required for the initiation and development of Hedgehog induced medulloblastoma. Therefore it may be crucial to consider the Hedgehog status of patients in order to interpret clinical data of Notch pathway inhibitors and even more importantly these results suggest that determining the Hedgehog status might be crucial before treatment of medulloblastoma patients with Notch pathway inhibitors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medulloblastoma</field><field name="subject">brain development</field><field name="subject">notch</field><field name="subject">hedgehog</field><field name="subject">rbp-j</field><field name="subject">cerebellum</field><field name="subject">granule neuron progenitor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211627</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behaviour and reproductive biology of captive southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons)</field><field name="creator">Lindsay Hogan</field><field name="description">Information on the reproductive biology and behavioural ecology of southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) is limited. Field reproductive and behavioural studies have been hindered by the difficulties associated with the routine recapturing and direct observation of wombats in the wild. Additionally, due to their extremely poor breeding success within captivity and the intrinsic complications associated with the monitoring of nocturnal and semi-fossorial activity, little formal research has been conducted on captive-held individuals. The overarching objectives of this research were to gain a better understanding of (1) both male and female L. latifrons reproductive physiology/behaviour that will lead to improved captive breeding program outcomes and (2) captive L. latifrons activity rhythms and behavioural time budgets in order to identify the impacts of captivity on wombat behaviour and wellbeing. The primary experiments of this research were centred around the development of &#8216;non-invasive methodologies&#8217; for the collection of biological samples (Chapter 2), direct observation of behaviour and activity (Chapter 3), assessment of male reproductive function (Chapter 4), detection of female oestrus and cyclicity (Chapter 5), characterisation of activity patterns (Chapter 6) and monitoring of stress (Chapter 7). The last two experiments also tested the efficacy of gentling (Chapter 7) and enrichment (Chapter 8) to improve the wellbeing of the captive wombats. Faecal steroid analysis is a non-invasive tool that allows the stress-free monitoring of steroid hormones and has been used on a wide range of animal species to examine their reproductive physiology and adrenal function. The usefulness of faecal hormone analysis, however, is directly related to the reliable collection and identification of individual faecal samples. In group-housed animals, the identification of faecal samples can be difficult and time consuming and is generally only accurate if a marker is incorporated into the animal&#8217;s diets. Hence, Chapter 2 examined the usefulness of non-toxic plastic glitter as a faecal marker in group-housed L. latifrons. Forty-two food treats were tested as vehicles for the oral delivery of glitter; of these, vehicle palatability (&gt; 75% consumed) and consistency of intake (eaten &gt; 80% of times offered) was high for six treats: (1) golden syrup with horse pellets, (2) golden syrup with weetbix, (3) pitted-dates, (4) honey with kangaroo pellets, (5) nutrigel with rolled-oats and (6) strawberry sauce with rolled-oats. Marker mean rate of passage was 2.9 &#177; 0.5 d, with maximal output occurring 4.2 &#177; 0.3 d after oral administration. A minimum marker dose of 1.6 g was necessary to achieve high labelling consistency (&gt; 2 flecks of glitter were defaecated in &gt; 90% of pellets) and this dosage was required every 3 days to maintain a steady and detectable state of marker output. Twelve glitter colours were tested and optimum labelling results were obtained with gold, metallic red, metallic green and metallic blue. Once established, this technique was then used to facilitate the long-term collection of faecal samples in order to characterize patterns of reproduction (Chapter 4), monitor ovarian events (Chapter 5) and to quantify stress-responses (Chapter 7) via faecal steroid analysis. The direct observation of wombats is difficult; individuals are not easily identified and the animals are often out-of-view (residing in burrows) or obscured (low-light conditions) during sampling. Published behavioural data available on L. latifrons is largely restricted to visual observations made during dawn and dusk only, whilst published activity data pertains to time spent in or out of the burrows rather than actual physical activity. Hence, Chapter 3 tested the effectiveness of two electronic monitoring systems to remotely observe wombat behaviour and physical activity. Digital video-surveillance proved to be an effective technique for the recording and monitoring of captive wombat behaviour. Animal visibility was good, behavioural events unambiguous and the system enabled the long-term, concurrent recording of behaviour with no direct human presence. Similarly, radio-telemetry proved to be an effective way of recording captive wombat physical activity. The system was reliable, removed observer error and enabled the continuous and concurrent recording of wombat activity. Once established, these two remote monitoring systems were then used to describe wombat behaviour elements and activity patterns (Chapters 3 and 6). After a year of continuous monitoring it was established that the wombats spent, on average, 69.9% sleeping, 8.8% lying resting, 5.2% feeding, 5.2% exploring, 4.3% stereotyping, 2.5% sitting-at-rest, 1.7% digging, 1.4% foraging, 0.4% being handled, 0.3% sun-basking, 0.2% grooming and 0.1% courtship/mating. Temporal patterns were bimodal for 8/12 of the wombat behaviours and unimodal for the remaining four. The mean proportion of total daily time spent active was 18.2 &#177; 1.8%. Daily activity patterns were characterized by a strong circadian cycle, with high nocturnal activity and low diurnal activity. Daily onset (18:19 h) and cessation (04:34 h) of activity was seasonally constant and strongly associated (P &lt; 0.01) with sunrise/set, but not influenced by either temperature or humidity (P &#8805; 0.09). At night there was an alternating rhythm of active and rest periods, with activity peaking at the beginning (19:00 h) and end (03:00 h) of each night. Activity was seasonal with annual changes in temperature, humidity and night-time length being the triggers of variation. Mean daily activity was greater during winter (19.7%) and spring (18.9%), than during summer (16.3%) and autumn (17.2%), with the degree of activity being largely governed by ambient temperature. Feeding, sleeping and stereotyping varied significantly with season. Feeding and stereotyping were negatively associated with ambient temperature and humidity, whilst being positively associated with night-time length; the inverse relationship was true for sleeping. Ambient temperature exerted its largest effect on time spent feeding; feeding times decreased by 3.1 min / 1&#186;C above 13&#186;C and compared to spring, feeding times were reduced by 41% during summer. There is, at present, very little data published on male and female wombat reproduction. The reticence of wombats to breed in captivity makes it difficult to study reproduction in captive animals and their cautious, nocturnal nature makes field studies challenging. Non-invasive techniques to monitor reproductive status/function will assist in improving the general knowledge of wombat reproduction and the development of new captive breeding management strategies, by allowing the easy monitoring of captive animals. Thus, the series of experiments in Chapters 4 and 5 explored the efficacy of a number of non-invasive methodologies to assess male reproductive function, monitor female cyclicity and predict the timing of oestrus. To address the pulsatile nature of testosterone, a GnRH agonist stimulation test was developed in the male. IM injection of 4 &#956;g of buserelin (a GnRH agonist) resulted in an increase (P &lt; 0.05) in plasma testosterone concentrations, with maximum secretion occurring at 90 min. Thereafter, plasma testosterone concentrations remained near maximum for 150 min. There was a strong, positive correlation (r = 0.73, P &lt; 0.01), between pre-stimulation testosterone concentrations and the maximal concentrations achieved post-stimulation with post-stimulation concentrations varying between individuals (P &lt; 0.01). These findings indicate that individual male wombats can show large fluctuations in plasma testosterone concentrations over time and that a GnRH agonist can be used to obtain a diagnostic index of the prevailing testosterone biosynthetic capacity of the testes. This technique was then used as part of a larger experiment (Chapter 4) to investigate seasonal changes in male wombat reproduction. To date, the effects of breeding season on captive male wombat fertility have yet to be examined and a better understanding of this phenomenon will pinpoint the most favourable times for mating. Seasonal changes in a series of male reproductive parameters were non-invasively examined over a 18 month period: (1) testosterone concentration, both plasmic and faecal, was monitored using enzyme-immunoassays (EIA), (2) testicular volume was measured manually using digital vernier callipers, (3) sperm production was evaluated by way of spermatorrhoea, whilst (4) prostate and bulbourethral gland cross-sectional areas were assessed by ultrasonography. Plasma testosterone secretion increased in early-winter, peaked late-winter and declined in early-spring (P &lt; 0.01). No seasonal variation (P = 0.22) in faecal testosterone metabolite concentrations was apparent. Testicular volume showed no significant variation (P = 0.29) over the sampling period and spermatozoa were found in the urine throughout the year; these two observations suggest that the captive male wombats remain spermatogenically active year round. While there was no significant seasonal change (P = 0.20) in prostate size, bulbourethral gland size increased in late-autumn, peaked in mid-winter and declined in early-summer (P &lt; 0.01). Ultimately, captive male reproductive function was influenced by seasonality, with a peak in plasma testosterone and bulbourethral gland size occurring in winter (Jun-Aug). In an attempt to characterize oestrus-specific behaviour and develop a reliable method of oestrus detection in L. latifrons, the reproductive physiology and behaviour of eight adult females was monitored for a period of 12 months (Chapter 5). The reproductive behaviour of both sexes (4&#9794;: 8&#9792;) was monitored using 24-h video surveillance, whilst female physical activity was remotely measured using radio-telemetry. A faecal sample was collected every three days, from each female to assess changes in faecal progesterone and oestradiol-17&#946; metabolite concentrations. Each female also received an injection of 0.01, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg of oestradiol benzoate (OB) in one of two hormone trials. Video surveillance revealed that the courtship (n = 426) and mating (n = 46) ritual of L. latifrons consisted of 13 distinctive behaviours expressed over six obvious phases: investigation, attraction, chase, restraint, copulation and recovery. Reproductive behaviour was observed in five (2&#9794;, 3&#9792;) wombats, with female receptivity occurring at night and lasting for only 13-h. Faecal progesterone metabolite analysis proved to be a reliable method for mapping oestrous cycle activity, but was not useful for the prediction of oestrus. Six out of the eight female wombats displayed periods of elevated progesterone secretion. From these six individuals, 23 luteal phases, 12 follicular phases and 12 oestrous cycles were recorded, with a mean (&#177; SE) length of 20.9 &#177; 1.1 d, 11.6 &#177; 0.6 d and 31.8 &#177; 1.1 d, respectively. In contrast, changes in the secretion of faecal oestradiol-17&#946; metabolites provided little instructive information on oestrous cycle activity and were not associated with oestrus. Administration of OB resulted in a spike of oestradiol-17&#946; metabolites in the faeces 3-4 d later, but was not dose dependent nor did it elicit oestrus-behaviour. Activity monitoring does not appear to be a useful method for detecting oestrus in L. latifrons, as changes were not associated with key events in the oestrous cycle. However, 24-h video surveillance proved to be a reliable method for oestrus detection in the captive L. latifrons. Threatening or aversive stimulation is experienced in wild and captive conditions alike and evokes similar physiological responses. If an animal, wild or captive, cannot cope with this stimulation it may experience stress. An uncontrollable source of stress for all captive animals lies in their interactions with their human caretakers. A high or persistent fear of people can be a source of psychological stress for animals in captivity. Positive handling is a potent method of reducing the specific fear of human beings through desensitisation. The response of animals to handling by humans has been extensively evaluated in domesticated species, but rarely assessed in wild animals. Hence, Chapter 7 examined the usefulness of a regular handling program to lower the behavioural fear and physiological stress responses of L. latifrons to human interaction. Adult L. latifrons (n = 12) were exposed to two different treatments in a replicated design: (1) daily handling: 15 min of tactile contact from a human handling 5 d/wk for 12 wk and (2) no-handling: no contact apart from that received during routine husbandry. The effect of handling was assessed using overt response, human approach, stressor and novel stimulus tests. Synthetic ACTH was used to validate a method for monitoring faecal cortisol in L. latifrons by EIA. IM injection of 250 &#956;g of Synacthen resulted in a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in plasma and faecal cortisol concentration 30 min and 2 d after administration, respectively. Handling positively affected the behavioural responses of the wombats to human approach and contact in two ways: (1) a significant reduction (P &lt; 0.01) in the wombat&#8217;s mean flight distances to human approach and (2) a significant (P &lt; 0.01) decline in the strength of the wombat&#8217;s behaviour-based fear reactions (i.e. fear scores) to human proximity and contact. Handling had no discernable effect on the wombat&#8217;s physiological stress responses to human contact or on their reactions to novelty. While faecal cortisol secretion increased in response to a stressor test involving human contact, it was not alleviated by regular handling (P = 0.84). Similarly, the wombat&#8217;s reactions to unfamiliar objects during novel stimulus testing were also unaffected (P = 0.17) by the handling treatment. Therefore, handling exerted its main effect on the behavioural responses of the wombats, representing fear responses to human handlers, rather than reducing their anxiety. The main difference between wild and captive environments lies in the differential ability of control, i.e. a free-living animal is able to control its amount of incoming stimulation whereas a captive animal has a limited capacity to alter the external stimulation to which it is exposed. Without natural behaviour outlets, captive animals have to rely on abnormal behaviour patterns to modify their expectations of the captive environment and exert some control over incoming stimulation. A &#8216;stereotypy&#8217;, defined as a repetitive movement pattern with no apparent goal or function, is a common abnormal behavioural pattern expressed by zoo animals. Stereotypies are of concern because of their association with poor welfare. A previous behavioural study revealed that common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) in captivity are very susceptible to the development of stereotypic behaviour. For that reason, the final experiment (Chapter 8) was designed to further examine stereotypic behaviour in wombats and tested whether environmental enrichment could be used to reduce its prevalence. Adult L. latifrons (n = 12) were subjected to two different treatments in a replicated design with 12 week periods: (1) Enrichment &#8211; animals received feed and olfactory enrichment, 5 d/wk and (2) No-enrichment - animals received the standard captive diet only. Wombat behaviour was remotely observed via 24-h video surveillance. Eight out of the 12 wombats displayed one of four stereotyped movements (straight-line pacing, boundary pacing, figure-8 pacing or wall-climbing), with time spent stereotyping ranging from 61-129 min/d (mean 87 &#177; 7 min/d); time devoted to stereotyping took up 4-9% of the daily budget. There was a significant increase in foraging (333%) and exploration (13%) in response to enrichment. Enrichment also encouraged the expression of a wider range of naturalistic foraging behaviours. Despite these positive effects, enrichment had no discernable effect on the time spent stereotyping (P = 0.87) or inactive (P = 0.13). Despite the fact that stereotypies and inactivity were not reduced by enrichment, animal welfare was still enhanced as there was a notable improvement in natural wombat-specific behavioural expression and diversity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wombat Lasiorhinus latifrons</field><field name="subject">Marsupial</field><field name="subject">reproduction</field><field name="subject">behaviour</field><field name="subject">Welfare</field><field name="subject">non-invasive monitoring</field><field name="subject">Captivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211676</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions Among Rodents, Owls, Food Resources and Habitat Structure in a Malaysian Oil Palm Agroecosystem</field><field name="creator">Chong Leong Puan</field><field name="description">Rodents often colonise agricultural lands and become pests that cause economic loss and crop damage. Eradicating or regulating pest numbers has economic and environmental costs and has always been of great interest to farmers and nature conservationists. To reduce rodent numbers poison baits are used more often than biological control. However, poisoning has adverse environmental impacts and ignores the underlying biological factors that influence pest abundance. This study examined the interactions of the common rat species of oil palm plantations, namely Rattus rattus diardii, R. argentiventer and R. tiomanicus, with their food resource, habitat structure and introduced predators in an attempt to provide a better understanding and approach for their control. To investigate the interrelationships among rodents, owls and oil palms, rodent trapping was conducted simultaneously with pellet collection and assessment of the breeding of owls over six study plots and seven trapping intervals in one oil palm plantation. Trapping records suggested that relative abundances of rodent species differed in plots with palms of differing ages. There were more R. r. diardii as a proportion of the total captures in older palms (seven years old) while R. argentiventer was the most common rat captured in younger palms (three years old). The abundance of R. tiomanicus remained low throughout trapping sessions for palms of all ages. A numerical response of rats to fruit availability in older palms was demonstrated by a positive and significant correlation between the numbers of fruit bunches present and the total number of rats captured. This relationship was observed in both older and younger palms only for R. argentiventer but not R. r. diardii or R. tiomanicus in either age of palms. This suggests that the competitiveness of R. argentiventer may be higher than that of the other two species providing that there were no factors other than food availability that limit the numbers of other two species. However, the levels of damage to palm fruit were significantly correlated with the relative abundance of R. argentiventer only in younger palms, not in older ones where R. r. diardii were more abundant. The more terrestrial nature of R. argentiventer may have restricted their acquisition of food when the palms became taller. In addition to differences in feeding niche, habitat heterogeneity may also be important in determining the rat species compositions at different ages of palms. Vegetation cover may act as a refuge for rats; the overall occurrence of rats, and especially R. argentiventer, was positively correlated with vegetation cover and height, and even certain vegetation associations. This study supported the continued use of the barn owl Tyto alba javanica for biological control of rodent pests in the palm oil plantations. The numbers of different rat species consumed by owls, as measured by pellet numbers, were proportional to prey captures with R. r. diardii dominating the prey items. Weights and sexes of rats, based upon sizes of bones recovered from owl pellets, indicated that the birds did not preferentially prey on any size or sex classes of rats. Although there was no differential predation by the owls, a functional, and possibly a numerical, response of the birds to changes in rat numbers was demonstrated. A functional response of barn owls to prey abundance was evidenced by a significant positive relationship between the relative abundance of rats captured and numbers of pellets collected. Some form of numerical response of barn owls was suggested by higher breeding records when rat abundances were significantly higher. Since both functional and numerical responses are important determinants of whether predators are likely to be able to regulate prey numbers, the role of barn owls as a practical biological control agent in oil palm plantations was supported. This study suggested that the regulation of rodent pests in oil palm plantations should not be limited to chemical measures but can be complemented by other biological factors including interspecific interactions, manipulation of the availability and density of food and habitat structure, in addition to predation by barn owls. The findings suggested that an integrated approach to rodent control, considering all biological factors that influence rat numbers, should be properly applied if an environmentally friendly and possibly cost effective approach is to be applied for the palm oil industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interspecific interactions</field><field name="subject">Numerical response</field><field name="subject">Functional response</field><field name="subject">Non-differential predation</field><field name="subject">Fruit bunch damage</field><field name="subject">Ground cover</field><field name="subject">Tyto alba javanica</field><field name="subject">Rattus rattus diardii</field><field name="subject">Rattus argentiventer</field><field name="subject">Oil palm plantation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:211772</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characteristics of hydrocyclones : and their application as control units in comminution circuits</field><field name="creator">Rao, T.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD.

Compared with CCCVd in coconut these CCCVd-like RNAs seemed to be present at low concentration in the oil palm samples as shown by the weak hybridization signals observed in the oil palm samples even when large amounts of nucleic acid extract (leaf fresh weight equivalent of 20-100 g) were loaded onto the gel. Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) was found to be more sensitive in detecting low concentrations of the CCCVd-like RNAs in the oil palm samples than Northern blots as shown by the higher percentage of positive samples. RPA showed that 90 % of the symptomatic and 50 % of asymptomatic palms from Malaysia had RNAs which protected the  &#179;&#178;P-labelled full length CCCVd antisense probe and produced a similar RPA pattern to that of CCCVd. RPA results also indicated that there were mismatches in the sequence of the CCCVd-like RNAs in the oil palms compared to CCCVd from coconut. RT-PCR amplification of CCCVd-like RNAs from an asymptomatic palm was only successful when nucleic acids were partially purified using 1D or 2D-PAGE. RNAs eluted from the circular region of 2D-gels of the asymptomatic palm were amplified to a low concentration using CCCVd-specific primers but re-amplification of these first round RT-PCR products was needed for detection of the amplicons by ethidium bromide staining. No amplified product was obtained from a symptomatic palm. Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR products from the asymptomatic oil palm produced 20 clones of five sizes comprising 297 nt (OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;), 293 nt (OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;), 270 nt (OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320;), 232 nt (OP&#8322;&#8323; &#8322;) and 165 nt (OP&#8321;&#8326;&#8325;). 71 % of the clones were OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;. Comparison of OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;, OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;, and OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320;  with genome database sequences showed high sequence similarity with CCCVd&#8322;&#8329;&#8326;. OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;. OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;, OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320; had 98 %, 97 % and 90 % sequence similarity with CCCVd&#8322;&#8329;&#8326; respectively. OP&#8322;&#8323;&#8322; and OP&#8321;&#8326;&#8325;  also had high sequence similarity with parts of CCCVd &#8322;&#8324;&#8326; with which they were aligned. Because an arbitrary level of 90 % sequence similarity is accepted as separating viroid species from variants, OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327; , OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323; and OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320;  can be considered as variants of CCCVd. No variants of the ' fast '  CCCVd &#8322; &#8324; &#8326; form were obtained. The consensus OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;  sequence had single base substitutions or additions at 5 sites, OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;  had substitutions, additions or deletions at 8 sites, and OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320; had substitutions at 4 sites as well as deletion of a 26 nt repeat at the right terminus, producing a predicted branched secondary structure. Compared with CCCVd&#8322;&#8329;&#8326; , all variants substituted (C-U) at nt 31 in the pathogenicity domain and (A-C) at nt 175 in the right hand terminal domain. The presence of sequences similar to OP&#8322;&#8323;&#8322; and OP&#8321;&#8326;&#8325;  has not been reported for CCCVd. Analysis of DNA extracted from both symptomatic and asymptomatic oil palms from Malaysia by nested PCR using universal primers sets to amplify the 16S rRNA operon showed the presence of phytoplasma-like DNAs in both sets of samples. They were also detected in DNA extracted from oil palm seedlings maintained at the Waite campus but not in the other palm species maintained in the glasshouse. RFLP analysis of phytoplasma-like DNAs gave a different pattern than that expected for Australian grapevine yellows phytoplasma. The phytoplasma - like DNAs were also not related to lethal yellowing phytoplasma (LYp) as PCR analysis with LYp specific primers did not produce any amplicon. No association with OS was found and so they were not characterised further. CCCVd-infected coconut leaf collected in the Philippines contained two short interfering RNAs (siRNA) approximately 20 nt and 25 nt in size. A high stringency wash of the Northern blots failed to remove the hybridisation signal suggesting that these siRNAs had sequences closely similar to CCCVd. The siRNAs were present in all stages of the cadang-cadang and also samples with the 'brooming' symptom. siRNAs are regarded as a marker for post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants infected by viroids but the results obtained were insufficient to determine whether PTGS regulates the accumulation of CCCVd. This is the first report that a viroid closely related to CCCVd occurs in oil palm, and in a region outside the Philippines, the country where CCCVd is thought to be contained. The implications for quarantine matters are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant diseases, oil palm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37756</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smoking and Periodontal Disease in Vietnamese Middle-Aged Population</field><field name="creator">Do, Loc Giang</field><field name="description">Current understanding of periodontal disease derives from studies mostly conducted in developed countries. However, the disease process among those studied populations may be confounded by the professional dental care. There have been few attempts to investigate factors related to the disease among populations of developing countries where the natural history of the disease is minimally confounded by care. This imbalance is evident in risk assessment research on the associations between periodontal disease and smoking-one of the most significant risk factors for the disease. Also, most studies on smoking used convenience or purposive samples, which may bias the findings. Therefore, there is a need for research conducted among a representative sample of a developing country. The present study aimed to describe the prevalence, extent and severity of chronic adult periodontitis among representative Vietnamese middle-aged adults. Also, it aimed to investigate smoking, which is highly prevalent in Vietnam, as a risk indicator for periodontal disease in a population with minimal access to dental care. The study was designed as a cross-sectional population-based study with a multistage, stratified random sample with probability of selection proportional to population size. The US National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) protocol was used to assess loss of periodontal attachment among 575 dentate subjects in two randomly selected provinces. Assessment was made at mesial and buccal sites of every present tooth, excluding third molars. A parallel social survey collected socio-demographic information and smoking history, which were assessed for possible association with the disease status.  Periodontal disease was highly prevalent among the sample. The patterns of the disease were similar to those reported from other populations. Virtually all subjects expressed some levels of disease, whereas only a few subjects or sites had severe disease. Bivariate analyses revealed significant associations between smoking and lower socio-economic status with more severe expression of the disease. Smoking was consistently associated with poorer periodontal status irrespective of outcome measure investigated. Multivariate models showed that smoking was the most predictive factor for the disease.  The Odds Ratio of having severe periodontitis (that is, having 2+sites with loss of attachment more than or equal to 5 mm and 1+sites with pocket depth more than or equal to 4 mm) was 7.93 for heavy smokers compared to non-smokers. A dose-response effect of the association between smoking and the outcomes of the disease was also evident.  The study provided a picture of the periodontal status of the representative sample from Vietnamese middle-aged adult population where the disease was less confounded by dental care. Furthermore, the study contributes consistency, strength and dose-response effect to the association of smoking as a risk indicator for periodontal destruction. The study should be used to assist the public health agencies in planning appropriate policies for Vietnam to address smoking and periodontal disease.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">periodontal disease, smoking, tobacco, Vietnamese</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37770</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in properties of vineyard red brown earths under long - term drip irrigation, combined with varying water qualities and gypsum application rates</field><field name="creator">Clark, Louise Jayne</field><field name="description">Irrigation water of poor quality can have deleterious effects on soils. However, the effect of drip irrigation on seasonal and long term (e.g. over 50 years) changes in soil chemical properties is poorly understood, complicated by the two-dimensional water flow patterns beneath drippers. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted, along with computer modelling, to evaluate morphological and physio-chemical changes in a typical Barossa Valley Red Brown Earth (Palexeralf, Chromosol or Lixisol) when drip irrigated under various changing management practices. This work focused on the following two management changes : (i) switching from long-term irrigation with a saline source to less saline water and (ii) gypsum (CaSO&#8324;) application. A literature review (Chapter 1) focuses on the distribution, features, properties and management of Red Brown Earths in the premium viticultural regions of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, South Australia. The effects of irrigation method and water quality on the rate and extent of soil deterioration are emphasised. The review also discusses the irrigation of grapes (Vitis vinifera) and summarises previous research into the effect of sodicity and salinity on grape and wine characteristics. This chapter shows the importance of Red Brown Earths to Australian viticulture, but highlights their susceptibility to chemical and physical degradation. Degradation may be prevented or remediated by increasing organic matter levels, applying gypsum, modifying cropping and through tillage practices such as deep ripping. Chapter 2 provides general information on the two study sites investigated, one in the Barossa Valley and the other at McLaren Vale. Local climate, geology, geomorphology and soils are described. Chapter 3 details laboratory, field and sampling methods used to elucidate changes in soil chemical and physical properties following irrigation. The genesis of the non-irrigated Red Brown Earth in the Barossa Valley is described in Chapter 4, and is inferred from geochemical, soil chemical, layer silicate and carbonate mineralogical data. Elemental gain and loss calculations showed 42% of original parent material mass was lost during the formation of A and A2 horizons, while the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons gained 50% of original parent material mass. This is consistent with substrate weathering and illuviation of clay from surface to lower horizons. The depth distributions of all major elements were similar ; the A horizon contained lower amounts of major elements than the remainder of the profile, indicating this region was intensely weathered. This chapter also compares the non-irrigated site to the adjacent irrigated site (separated by 10 m) to determine if the sites are pedogenically identical and geochemical changes from irrigation. Many of the differences between the non-irrigated and irrigated sites appear to be correlated with variations in quartz, clay, Fe oxide and carbonate contents, with little geological variation between the sample sites. In Chapter 5 morphological, chemical and physical properties of a non-irrigated and irrigated Red Brown Earth in the Barossa Valley are compared. Alternating applications of saline irrigation water (in summer) and non-saline rain water (in winter) have caused an increase in electrical conductivity (EC [subscript se]), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), bulk density (&#961; b) and pH. This has resulted in enhanced clay dispersion and migration. Impacts on SAR and &#961; b are more pronounced at points away from the dripper due to the presence of an argillic horizon, which has greatly influenced the variations in these soil properties with depth and distance from the dripper. Dispersion and migration of clay were promoted by alternating levels of EC, while SAR remained relatively constant, resulting in the formation of a less permeable layer in the Bt1 horizon. Clay dispersion (breakdown of micro-aggregate structure) was inferred from reduced numbers of pores and voids, alterations in colouring (an indication that iron has changed oxidation state) and increased bulk density (up to 30 %). Eleven years of irrigation changed the soil from a Calcic Palexeralf (non-irrigated) to an Aquic Natrixeralf (irrigated) (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). These results, combined with data from Chapter 4, were used to develop a mechanistic model of soil changes with irrigation. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 describe field experiments conducted in the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions. This data shows seasonal and spatial variations in soil saturation extract properties ( EC [subscript se], SAR [subscript se], Na [subscipt se] and Ca [subscript se] ). At the Barossa Valley site (Chapter 6) non-irrigated soils had low EC [subscript se], SAR [subscript se], Na [subscript se] and Ca [subscript se] values throughout the sampling period. The irrigated treatments included eleven years of drip irrigation with saline water (2.5 dS / m) and also gypsum application at 0, 4 or 8 tonnes/hectare in 2001 and 2002. Salts in the profile increased with gypsum application rate, with high levels occurring midwinter 2002 prior to rainfall leaching salts. SAR has declined with gypsum application, particularly in the A horizon and at 100 cm from the dripper in the Bt1 horizon ; this has the potential to reflocculate clay particles and improve soil hydraulic conductivity. Chapter 7 presents further results from the Barossa Valley site, this treatment had been irrigated for 9 years with saline water (2.5 dS / m) prior to switching to a less saline water source (0.5 dS / m). The soil also received gypsum at 0, 4 or 8 tonnes / hectare in 2001 and 2002. It was found that the first few years are critical when switching to a less saline water source. EC declines rapidly, but SAR requires a number of years, depending on conditions, to decline, resulting in a period during which the Bt1 horizon may become dispersed. Gypsum application increased the EC [subscipt se] but not to the EC [subscript se] levels of soil irrigated with saline water. Chapter 8 examines soil chemical properties of a McLaren Vale vineyard, irrigated with moderately saline water (1.2 dS / m) since 1987 and treated with gypsum every second year since establishment. This practice prevented the SAR (&lt; 8) rising and a large zone of the soil profile (20 to 100 cm from dripper) has a high calcium level (&gt; 5 mmol / L). However, irrigation caused the leaching of calcium beneath the dripper in both the A and B horizons (0 to 20 cm from dripper) (&lt; 4 mmol / L). Chapters 9 and 10 interpret and discuss results from continuous monitoring of redox potential (Eh) and soil solution composition in the Barossa Valley vineyard, irrigated with saline or non-saline water, and gypsum-treated at 0 and 4 tonnes / hectare. Soil pore water solution (Chapter 9) collected by suction cups is compared to results obtained in chapters 6 and 7. The soil has extended zones and times of high SAR and low EC. This was particularly evident in the upper B horizon, where the SAR of the soil remained stable throughout the year while the EC was more seasonally variable with EC declining during the winter months. The A horizon does not appear to be as susceptible to clay dispersion (compared to the B horizon) because during periods of low EC the SAR also declines, which may be due to the low CEC (low clay and organic matter content) of this horizon. Chapter 10 presents redox potentials (Eh) measured using platinum redox electrodes installed in the A, A2 and Bt1 horizons to examine whether Eh of the profile varies with irrigation water quality and gypsum application. Saline irrigation water caused the B horizon to become waterlogged in winter months, while less saline irrigation water caused a perched watertable to develop, due to a dispersed Bt1 horizon. Application of gypsum reduced the soil Eh particularly in the A2 horizon (+ 500 to + 50 mV) during winter. Thus redox potential can be influenced by irrigation water quality and gypsum applications. Chapter 11 incorporated site data from the Barossa Valley non-irrigated site into a predictive mathematical model, TRANSMIT, a 2D version of LEACHM. This model was used to predict zones of gypsum accumulation during long-term irrigation (67 years). When applied over the entire soil surface, gypsum accumulated at 60 to 90 cm from the dripper in the B horizon; higher application rates caused increased accumulation. When applied immediately beneath the irrigation dripper, gypsum accumulated in a 'column' under the dripper (at 0 to 35 cm radius from the dripper), with very little movement away from the dripper. Also, the zone of accumulation of salts from high and low salinity irrigation water was investigated. These regions were found to be similar, although concentrations were significantly lower with low salinity water. In low rainfall years salts accumulated throughout the B horizon (35 - 150 cm), while in periods of high rainfall (and leaching) the A, A2 and Bt1 horizons (0 - 60 cm) were leached, although at greater depths (80 - 150 cm) salt concentrations remained high. Chapter 12 summarises results and provides an understanding of soil processes in drip irrigated soils to underpin improved management options for viticulture. This study combines results from redox and soil solution monitoring, mineralogy, elemental gains and losses, and seasonal soil sampling to develop a mechanistic model of soil processes, which was combined with computer modelling to predict future properties of the soil. Major conclusions and recommendations of this study include : - Application of saline irrigation water to soil then ameliorated with gypsum - The first application of gypsum was leached by the subsequent irrigation from extended regions of the soil. As Na continues to enter the system via irrigation water, gypsum needs to be regularly applied. Otherwise calcium will be leached through the soil and SAR increases. - Application of non-saline irrigation water to soil then ameliorated with gypsum - The soil was found to only require one application at 8 tons / ha as this reduced SAR sufficiently. As less salt is entering the soil, subsequent gypsum applications can be at a lower rate or less frequently than required for saline irrigation water. - Gypsum applied directly beneath the dripper systems distributes calcium to a narrow region of the soil, while large regions of the soil require amelioration (high SAR) and are not receiving calcium. Therefore, gypsum application through the drip system or only beneath the dripper should be combined with broad acre application. - A range of methods to sample vineyards is recommended for duplex soils, including the use of saturation extracts, sampling time, sampling location (distance from dripper) and depth of sampling. This work is critical for vineyard management and may be applicable to other Australian viticulture regions with Red Brown Earths.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapes irrigation, salinity, sodicity, salt-affected soils</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37808</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of dietary fish oil and fibre on contractility of gut smooth muscle.</field><field name="creator">Patten, Glen Stephen</field><field name="description">From animal experimentation, and studies using in vitro models, there was evidence in the literature to suggest that dietary fibre may influence contractility and motility of the gastrointestinal tract and long chain (LC) n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from marine sources may influence contractility of smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. The hypothesis of this thesis was that dietary fish oil and/or fibre influence the contractility of isolated intact sections of gut smooth muscle tissue from small animal models. Methodology was established to measure in vitro contractility of intact pieces of guinea pig ileum with the serosal side isolated from the lumen. It was demonstrated that four amino acid peptides from &#954;-casein (casoxins) applied to the lumen overcame morphine-induced inhibition of contraction. Using this established technology, the guinea pig was used to investigate the effects of dietary fibre and fish oil supplementation on gut in vitro contractility. In separate experiments, changes in sensitivity to electrically-driven and 8-iso-prostanglandin (PG)E&#8322;-induced contractility were demonstrated for dietary fibre and fish oil. A modified, isolated gut super-perfusion system was then established for the rat to validate these findings. It was subsequently shown that LC n-3 PUFA from dietary fish oil significantly increased maximal contraction in response to the G-protein coupled receptor modulators, acetylcholine and the eicosanoids PGE&#8322;, PGF&#8322;&#945;, 8-iso-PGE&#8322; and U-46619 in ileum but not colon, without changes in sensitivity (EC&#8325;&#8320;), when n-3 PUFA as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) had been incorporated to a similar degree into the gut total phospholipid membrane pool. It was further established that the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) had a depressed prostanoid (PGE&#8322;and PGF&#8322;&#945;) response in the gut that could be restored by dietary fish oil supplementation (5% w/w of total diet) in the ileum but not the colon. Importantly, the muscarinic response in the colon of the SHR was increased by fish oil supplementation with DHA likely to be the active agent. Dietary fish oil dose experiments deduced differential increases in response occurred at fish oil concentrations of 1% for muscarinic and 2.5% (w/w) for prostanoid stimulators of the ileum with no difference in receptor-independent KCl-induced depolarization-driven contractility. Studies combining high amylose resistant starch (HAMS, 10% w/w) and fish oil (10% w/w) fed to young rats demonstrated a low prostanoid response that was enhanced by dietary fish oil but not resistant starch. There was however, an interactive effect of the HAMS and fish oil noted for the muscarinic-mimetic, carbachol. Generally, resistant starch increased the large bowel short chain fatty acid pool with a subsequent lower pH. Binding studies determined that while the total muscarinic receptor binding properties of an isolated ileal membrane fraction were not affected in mature rats by dietary fish oil, young rats had a different order of muscarinic receptor subtype response with a rank order potency of M&#8323; &gt; M&#8321; &gt; M&#8322; compared to mature animals of M&#8323; &gt; M&#8322; &gt; M&#8321; with fish oil altering the sensitivity of the M&#8321; receptor subtype in isolated carbachol-precontracted ileal tissue. In conclusion, experiments using the guinea pig and rat gut models demonstrated that dietary fish oil supplementation, and to a lesser degree fibre, increased receptor-driven contractility in normal and compromised SHR ileum and colon. Further, changes in responsiveness were demonstrated in the developing rat gut prostanoid and muscarinic receptor populations that could be altered by dietary fish oil. Preliminary evidence suggested that fish oil as DHA may alter receptor-driven gut contractility by mechanisms involving smooth muscle calcium modulation. Defining the role that dietary fibre and fish oil, and other nutrients, play in normal and diseased states of bowel health such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where contractility is compromised, are among the ongoing challenges.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dietary; fish oil; fibre; gut; smooth muscle; contractility</field><field name="subject">Fish oils Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Fiber in human nutrition</field><field name="subject">Smooth muscle</field><field name="subject">Muscle contraction Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48392</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of CO2 and green-house gases (GHG) miscibility and interactions with oil to enhance the oil recovery in gas flooding processes.</field><field name="creator">Emera, Mohammed Kamal</field><field name="description">1. Objective: The objective of this research has been to develop more reliable models to predict the miscibility and interactions between CO&#8322; or green-house gas (GHG) and oil (dead and live oils) over a wider range of conditions, based on data from different site sources, considering all the major variables affecting each modelled parameter, and for different injected gas compositions. The Genetic algorithm (GA), an artificial intelligence technique based on the Darwinian theory of evolution that mimics some of the natural processes in living organisms, was used to develop these models, based on GA software that has been developed in this work (as a modelling technique). While applications of GA have been used recently in the mathematical and computer sciences, its applications in the petroleum engineering, especially EOR research, have been limited.  2. Motivation to Investigate the Potential of GA-based Models: The detrimental effects of CO&#8322; and/or GHG emissions from various industrial and human/activity sources on the environment are a major concern worldwide. This has resulted in an intensive global R&amp;D effort to lower or mitigate the damaging impact of GHG on the environment. One potentially attractive and effective means of lowering the GHG emissions could be to capture them from their major sources of emissions and then sequester them in depleted oil and gas reservoirs while also enhancing oil recovery. Typically, a GHG stream, also referred to as "flue gas", contains high percentages of CO&#8322; in addition to other gases, notably, N&#8322;, NO&#8339; and SO&#8339;. The presence of high CO&#8322; content in the flue gas, in particular, could make this option potentially viable, provided the miscibility and interaction properties between the injected gas and reservoir fluids are favorable. Therefore, it is critical to ascertain the likely miscibility and interactions parameters between the injected gas (CO&#8322; or flue gas) and oil at different conditions to determine the optimal miscibility and interaction conditions that contribute to oil viscosity reduction and oil swelling. They in turn enhance oil recovery through improved gas flooding process performance due to higher oil mobility, volumetric sweep efficiency, and relative permeability to oil. Often miscibility and interactions between injected gases and oils are established through "experimental methods", "new mathematical models" based on phase equilibria data and equations of state (EOS), and available "published models". Experimental methods are time-consuming and costly. Moreover, they can handle only limited conditions. Mathematical models require availability of a considerable amount of reservoir fluid composition data, which may not be available most of the time. Although, the published models are simpler and faster to use, one must however recognise that most of these models were developed and validated based on limited data ranges from site-specific conditions. Therefore, their applications cannot be generic. Another noteworthy point is that most of the interactions models have been developed using dead oil data and pure CO&#8322; as an injected gas. Hence, they do not perform well for a wider range of live oils, as well as injected flue gases, which contain different components besides CO&#8322;. Consequently, there is a need to have more reliable miscibility and interaction models, which can handle a much wider range of conditions and different data sources. Also, these models should be able to consider all the major variables, different injected gas compositions, and live oil in addition to dead oil. 3. GA-based Models Developed in This Research: -- GA-based model for more reliable prediction of minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) between reservoir oil and CO&#8322;: This model recognised the major variables affecting MMP (reservoir temperature, MWc&#8325;&#8330; , and volatiles and intermediates compositions). It has been successfully validated with published experimental data and compared to common models in the literature. It is noted that GA-based CO&#8322;-oil MMP offered the best match with the lowest error and standard deviation. -- GA-based flue gas-oil MMP model: For this model, the MMP was regarded as a function of the injected gas solubility into oil, which in turn is related to the injected gas critical properties (pseudocritical temperature and pressure) besides reservoir temperature and oil composition. A critical temperature modification factor was also used in developing this model. The GA-based model has also been successfully validated against published experimental data and compared to several models in the literature. It yielded the best match with the lowest average error and standard deviation. Moreover, unlike other models, it can be used more reliably for gases with higher N&#8322; (up to 20 mole%) and different non-CO&#8322; components (e.g., H&#8322;S, N&#8322;, SO&#8339;, O&#8322;, and C&#8321;-C&#8324;) with higher ratio (up to 78 mole%). -- GA-based CO&#8322;-oil physical properties models: These models have been developed to predict CO&#8322; solubility, impact on the oil swelling factor, CO&#8322;-oil density, and CO&#8322;-oil viscosity for both dead and live oils. These models recognised the major variables that affect each physical property and also properly address the effects of CO2 liquefaction pressure and oil molecular weight (MW). These models have been successfully validated with published experimental data and have been compared against several widely used models. The GA-based CO&#8322;-oil properties models yielded more accurate predictions with lower errors than other models that have been tested. Furthermore, unlike the other tested models, which are applicable to only limited data ranges and conditions, GA-based models can be applied over a wider data range and conditions. -- GA-based flue gas-oil physical properties models: These models predict flue gas-oil properties such as, flue gas solubility, impact on the oil swelling factor, and flue gas-oil density and viscosity while recognising all the major variables affecting each property. Also, the GA-based models recognised the different injected flue gas compositions. These models have been successfully validated with published experimental data and have also been compared against other commonly reported CO&#8322;-oil models, which are often used for flue gas-oil physical properties prediction. The GA-based models consistently yielded a lower prediction error than the models that have been tested. Furthermore, unlike other models, which are applicable only over limited data ranges and conditions, GA-based models can be valid over a wider range of data under various conditions. All the above-mentioned models, developed in this research, are particularly useful when experimental data are lacking and the project financial situation is a concern. In addition, these models can be useful as a fast track gas flooding project screening guide. Also, they can easily be incorporated into a reservoir simulator for CO&#8322; or flue gas flooding design and simulation. Furthermore, they can serve as yet another useful tool to design optimal and economical experimental test protocols to  etermine the miscibility and interactions between the injected CO&#8322; or flue gas and oils in gas flooding processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60566</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed. Analytic concepts&#8212; such as forced migration, cultural bereavement, adaptation, integration, diaspora, transnationalism, identification, and community of practice&#8212; are used to trace the trajectory of the contemporary way of life of Cambodians, their community development, and their cultural identity. The data gathered from mixedmethod research reveal the various opinions, strategies, coping mechanisms, and paths that Cambodian participants have adopted in order to adapt to life in New Zealand and still maintain their Khmer heritage. The majority of participants were proud of their personal achievements, and now have found normalcy in their new life. Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand). Key words: Cambodian refugees, forced migration, adaptation, integration, transnationalism, Buddhism, Khmer identity, community development, and community of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life history and demography of the pipi, Paphies australis (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Simon Holloway.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life history characteristics of the New Zealand pipi (Paphies australis) from gametogenesis, through spawning, larval development, settlement, juvenile recruitment patterns, distribution and abundance patterns, population size structure and growth characteristics from the Whangateau Harbour, in northeastern New Zealand. The thesis concludes by integrating this information into a model, based on hydrographic information and post settlement movement in order to help explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance of juvenile and adult pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. The temporal pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was investigated over two years (May 1991 - April 1993). Samples of pipi gonads were processed using standard histological techniques, and the resultant sections placed into six developmental categories (early active, late active, mature, partially spawned and indeterminate). Gametogenesis was similar in both years, beginning in autumn with most pi pi in early active stages of development. By late winter many pipi were mature. Spawning commenced in early spring and continued through spring and summer. From a sample of 104 pi pi collected in spring 1992 for investigation into the length at sexual maturity, all pipi were found to be sexually mature above 40 mm shell length, but some individuals between 30-40 mm also had gonads with sex cells present. This sample had a sex ratio significantly biased towards females. Further analysis revealed that juveniles (below 40 mm shell length) had a significantly higher proportion of females than males, but adults (above 40 mm shell length) had a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. No evidence of hermaphroditism was observed. The spatial pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was also investigated over one year (February 1992 to January 1993) at three subtidal sites using the same techniques as for the temporal study, but with one further category (parasitised). The reproductive cycle was similar between sites, with an extended spawning period . of late winter to summer. It was concluded that the reproductive cycle of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour was synchronised at all three sites sampled. A visual maturity index gave the same overall pattern of reproductive cycle as the histological analysis, but was found to be inaccurate mainly due to a poor recognition of the mature stages. It was concluded that the visual index was of limited value in accurately assessing the maturity of an individual. The sex ratio of adult pipi was not significantly different from 1: 1. A small percentage (0.87%) of pi pi were infected by a digenetic trematode fluke that, in most cases, totally castrated the individual. The larval development of pipi was described from larval culture experiments. Pi pi were conditioned, spawned and the resultant larvae reared to settlement in the laboratory. Adult pipi were successfully conditioned after 23 days at 22&#176;C. Spawning was accomplished using a combination of increased temperature and a dilute sperm solution. Settlement occurred 18-22 days after spawning at a mean shell length of 264 Ilm . After settlement and metamorphosis pi pi gradually began to take on the adult shape. Cultured juveniles were grown to 37 mm shell length both in the laboratory and later in the wild. Once in the wild, cultured pipi grew from 13 mm to 37 mm in 17 months with a strong seasonal component to their growth. Microscopic examination revealed slight differences in shell morphology between pi pi larvae and the closely related tuatua (Paphies subtriangu/ata) and toheroa (Paphies ventricosa). Pi pi were more rounded and smaller than both tuatua and toheroa at a similar stage of development. The results of scanning electron microscope examination of larval shell hinge structure confirmed previous preliminary findings for pipi. The larval shell ligament is posterior to the centre of the provinculum in pipi but central in both the tuatua and toheroa. These differences are sufficient to enable larval pipi to be distinguished from larval toheroa and tuatua. The spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of pipi were measured from November 1991 to January 1994. Previous information had suggested that pipi were a mainly intertidal species, but this study found that they can occur in large numbers subtidally. Temporal sampling was carried out by systematically measuring the abundance of pipi found within three subtidal grids. Abundances were compared within and between the grids. The subtidal population was extremely dense (up to 4400 m-2 ), with well defined boundaries. Pipi densities at the edges of the beds dropped from many hundreds to zero m-2 within 2 to 3 m. Large numbers of juvenile pi pi &#171;30 mm) were present at the start of sampling and the density of these decreased during the sampling period. Juvenile pipi occurred at high density at the harbour entrance site, but were rare or absent at the other two sites further up the harbour. Small scale distribution (ie. within a grid) at the harbour entrance showed high variability which was linked to large swells from storms, observed only at this site. The advantages of systematic sampling compared with random or haphazard sampling are discussed. The population size structure, growth and small scale movement patterns of pipi, were also studied. Pi pi formed a continuous bed from the harbour entrance up the main subtidal channel, and extended approximately one kilometre upstream. Pi pi had different shell morphologies at different sites within the harbour, and population size structure differed among sites. Small pi pi were found at either end of the subtidal pi pi bed but were absent from the middle. Analysis of length-frequency distributions indicated that there had been a large recruitment of pipi prior to the commencement of the study, but little further recruitment occurred during 1992 to 1994. Pipi took approximately three to four years to reach the population maximum size of 55-60 mm shell length. Tagged pipi, constrained in suspended nets grew more slowly than predicted from population length-frequency analysis, but tagged pi pi that were returned to the sediment grew as predicted. Localised movement of tagged pipi showed that pi pi gradually move into the centre (deeper part) of the channel and towards the harbour entrance. Adult and juvenile pipi, were observed drifting in mid-water, in the Whangateau Harbour. The animals were buoyed up by the secretion of long mucus threads which extended out through their siphons. Quantitative information from netting experiments over a period of five months from May 1993 to September 1993, collected a total of 509 drifting pipi. These were mainly juveniles &#171;15 mm shell length) but a small number of adults (up to 58 mm shell length) were also collected. The numbers of pi pi caught was highly variable, however, there was a trend for more drifting pipi to be caught on the flood tide (n=386) than the ebb tide (n=123). Overall there was little difference in the number of pipi caught between spring (n=263) and neap tides (n=246), however, this was heavily influenced by one neap tide in May 1993 (n=207). Three other bivalve species (So/etellina sp, Gari stangeri, Macomona . lilliana) were also caught drifting. Pipi were also observed to attach themselves to debris, such as dead branches of trees, which then moved them with the tidal currents. Large epiphytic algal growths on the shell also acted to buoy individuals which moved them around in tidal currents. It is hypothesised that mucus drifting in pipi is an active process, adopted for movement to other areas triggered by very high densities (over 4000 m2 ) in the harbour entrance. Finally, the distribution and size structure of the pi pi population was described by a simple model, based on the post-settlement movement of pi pi and tidal current patterns. Pipi recruits &#171;5 mm shell length) were found to be largely restricted to a small strip, mid-intertidally in clean coarse sediments. Juvenile pi pi (5-35 mm) were found at a low intertidal site directly downstream of the recruitment site. Further downstream of this site, at a subtidal site at the harbour entrance both juvenile and adult pi pi were found. A similar population size structure was found at the innermost extent of the pi pi bed in the main channel. Adult pi pi were abundant in the central part of the pi pi bed, but no juveniles were found at this site. It was concluded that post-settlement movement patterns could account for the distribution patterns of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. If subsequently found to be of more general applicability, this model provides a powerful, predictive tool for managing pipi population and possibly other infaunal clams. This study provides, for the first time, a detailed description of the distribution and abundance of an entire pipi population from one harbour. This information allows a more informed management of pi pi populations around New Zealand. It also provides a framework in which more indepth questions about the ecology of pipi populations (and other bivalve populations) can be more clearly addressed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5758</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value and price: a transdisciplinary approach to ecologically sustainable urban water management</field><field name="creator">Creagh, Karen Kviberg</field><field name="description">This thesis puts forward the benefits of a transdisciplinary approach to environmental  management, using urban New Zealand use and value of freshwater as a case in  point. In New Zealand, the deficiencies of urban water management have become  more evident over the last decades spurring a long process of water reform.  Changing precipitation patterns are increasing the risk of flooding events and water  shortages; there are regional and seasonal stresses on freshwater resources; and  people's attitudes and expectations are poorly understood. Existing pricing structures  are obscuring signals of both water shortages and wasteful practices.  This research examined and mapped people's awareness, perceptions, attitudes and  preferences in Auckland City and Christchurch City; two communities with different  cultural, ecological and political systems of water management. A system-based  contingent valuation method was developed to establish the level of acceptance for  including ecosystem services as a part of the water infrastructure equation in the two  communities. By eliciting a willingness to pay for water related ecosystem goods and  services, values were coupled with price and consumption. It was found that the old  mindset seeing water as a free gift from nature prevails in some communities even in  the presence of higher environmental awareness, encouraging unsustainable  consumption and potentially creating political inertia about water management  reforms.  It was found that there was a positive willingness to pay for ecosystem services in  both cities, and that motivational factors were stronger predictors than socioeconomic  variables for accepting the proposed pricing structure in Christchurch. The  systems approach developed in this thesis identified cultural-ecological city identity  constructs as having a strong potential for building community expectations for  ecologically sustainable water management. It is recommended that local water  authorities are established consisting of tangata whenua, stakeholders and experts  from social, economic and ecological fields, and to be charged with developing local  visions for water management and restoration programmes for water related  ecosystems. It is recommended that pricing should include terms for full-cost  recovery, resource rent, scarcity and investment in natural capital.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5886</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the health human resource development provisions of the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Master of Public Policy, Massey University at Albany</field><field name="creator">Tiongco-Cruda, Beatriz</field><field name="description">Republic Act No. 9173, or the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 enunciates a bevy of incentives under its Health Human Resource Production, Utilization and Development provisions, intended to stem the rising tide of Filipino nurses leaving the country to work overseas. Under Sections 30 to 34 of the Nursing Act, these incentives include the following: (1) upgrading the minimum base salary of nurses from salary grade 10 to 15; (2) establishing a nurse specialty program in government hospitals to upgrade the nurses&#8217; skills whereby recipients of the program are required to work in government hospitals for two years; and (3) the provision of other benefits such as scholarship grants, free medical care, etc. These provisions are the government&#8217;s policy response to mitigate the impact of nurses&#8217; migration and retain an adequate supply of skilled Filipino nurses in the country: This research is a qualitative study that seeks to assess the health human resource development provisions and their implementation and aims to help improve them. This study examines the responsiveness of the provisions to the needs of nurses, and identifies the deficiencies of the provisions by looking into the working conditions of nurses in two Philippine government hospitals. It also examines the processes and the factors affecting the implementation of the provisions. This study employed a combination of four data collection methods: (1) focus group interviews of nurses working in two Philippine government hospitals, (2) key informant interviews of officials of government agencies and private organizations tasked to implement the health human resource development provisions, (3) document analyses, and (4) researcher&#8217;s field notes/journal. The researcher conducted five focus group interviews with a total of 15 nurse participants and 12 key informant interviews.  The nurses are working under conditions of low salaries and heavy workload, that is characterized by low nurse-to-patient ratios in the National and LGU Hospitals. The problems of inadequate nurse staffing, large number iii of patients and inadequate supplies in the two government hospitals are identified as causes for the heavy workload of nurses. The nurses want a salary increase that is commensurate to their heavy workload, their professional qualifications and long years of service. For the nurses, a salary increase signifies the government&#8217;s recognition of their dedication, hard work, and commitment to provide health care to Filipinos despite working under dire circumstances. The nurse specialty training program in areas such as oncology, nephrology, critical care, etc. has not been implemented because of the limited capacities of government hospitals to provide this kind of training and the lack of regulatory framework for the practice of nurse specialists in the Philippines. The other benefits have not been implemented as well. The provisions of the Nursing Act are deficient because they do not address the causes of the heavy workload of nurses. To improve the work conditions of nurses, the Philippine government needs to prioritize to the long neglected health sector by increasing the budgetary allocation in order to create more nurse positions in government hospitals, to provide adequate supplies and equipment for government hospitals and to improve the facilities for nurses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filipino nurses</field><field name="subject">government hospitals</field><field name="subject">nurses' working conditions</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/870</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of field techniques to predict soil carbon, soil nitrogen and root density from soil spectral reflectance : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kusumo, Bambang Hari</field><field name="description">The objectives of this research were to develop and evaluate a field method for in situ measurement of soil properties using visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS). A probe with an independent light source for acquiring soil reflectance spectra from soil cores was developed around an existing portable field spectrometer (ASD FieldSpecPro, Boulder, CO, USA; 350-2500 nm). Initial experiments tested the ability of the acquired spectra to predict plant root density, an important property in soil carbon dynamics. Reflectance spectra were acquired from soil containing ryegrass roots (Lolium multiflorum) grown in Allophanic and Fluvial Recent soils in a glasshouse pot trial. Differences in root density were created by differential nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to calibrate spectral data (pre-processed by smoothing and transforming spectra to the first derivative) against laboratory-measured root density data (wet-sieve technique). The calibration model successfully predicted root densities (r2 = 0.85, RPD = 2.63, RMSECV = 0.47 mg cm-3) observed in the pots to a moderate level of accuracy. This soil reflectance probe was then tested using a soil coring system to acquire reflectance spectra from two soils under pasture (0-60 mm soil depths) that had contrasting root densities. The PLSR calibration models for predicting root density were more accurate when soil samples from the two soils were separated rather than grouped. A more accurate prediction was found in Allophanic soils (r2 = 0.83, RPD = 2.44, RMSECV = 1.96 mg g-1) than in Fluvial Recent soils (r2 = 0.75, RPD = 1.98, RMSECV = 5.11 mg g-1). The Vis-NIRS technique was then modified slightly to work on a soil corer that could be used to measure root contents from deeper soil profiles (15- 600 mm depth) in arable land (90-day-old maize crop grown in Fluvial Recent soils). PLSR calibration models were constructed to predict the full range of maize root densities (r2 = 0.83, RPD = 2.42, RMSECV = 1.21 mg cm-3) and also soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations that had been determined in the laboratory (LECO FP- 2000 CNS Analyser; Leco Corp., St Joseph, MI, USA). Further studies concentrated on improving the Vis-NIRS technique for prediction of total C and N concentrations in differing soil types within different soil orders in the field. The soil coring method used in the maize studies was evaluated in permanent and recent pastoral soils (Pumice, Allophanic and Tephric Recent in the Taupo-Rotorua Volcanic Zone, North Island) with a wide range of soil organic matter contents resulting from different times (1-5 years) since conversion from forest soils. Without any sample preparation, other than the soil surface left after coring, it was possible to predict soil C and N concentrations with moderate success (C prediction r2 = 0.75, RMSEP = 1.23%, RPD = 1.97; N prediction r2 = 0.80, RMSEP = 0.10%, RPD = 2.15) using a technique of acquiring soil reflectance spectra from the horizontal cross-section of a soil core (H method). The soil probe was then modified to acquire spectra from the curved vertical wall of a soil core (V method), allowing the spectrometer&#8217;s field of view to increase to record the reflectance features of the whole soil sample taken for laboratory analysis. Improved predictions of soil C and N concentrations were achieved with the V method of spectral acquisition (C prediction r2 = 0.97, RMSECV = 0.21%, RPD = 5.80; N prediction r2 = 0.96, RMSECV = 0.02%, RPD = 5.17) compared to the H method (C prediction r2 = 0.95, RMSECV = 0.27%, RPD = 4.45; N prediction r2 = 0.94, RMSECV = 0.03%, RPD = 4.25). The V method was tested for temporal robustness by assessing its ability to predict soil C and N concentrations of Fluvial Recent soils under permanent pasture in different seasons. When principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ensure that the spectral dimensions (which were responsive to water content) of the data set used for developing the PLSR calibration model embraced those of the &#8220;unknown&#8221; soil samples, it was possible to predict soil C and N concentrations in &#8220;unknown&#8221; samples of widely different water contents (in May and November), with a high level of accuracy (C prediction r2 = 0.97, RMSEP = 0.36%, RPD = 3.43; N prediction r2 = 0.95, RMSEP = 0.03%, RPD = 3.44). This study indicates that Vis-NIRS has considerable potential for rapid in situ assessment of soil C, N and root density. The results demonstrate that field root densities in pastoral and arable soil can be predicted independently from total soil C, which will allow researchers to predict C sequestration from root production. The recommended &#8220;V&#8221; technique can be used to assess spatial and temporal variability of soil carbon and nitrogen within soil profiles and across the landscape. It can also be used to assess the rate of C sequestration and organic matter synthesis via root density prediction. It reduces the time, labour and cost of conventional soil analysis and root density measurement.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil properties</field><field name="subject">soil carbon dynamics</field><field name="subject">root density</field><field name="subject">in situ assessment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300101 Soil physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1015</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Un i form "consisting of one" : a written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clement, Julie</field><field name="description">Uni form is an exploration into the act of getting dressed.

The TH2 cytokine Interleukin (IL)-4 promotes infiltration of eosinophils to sites of inflammation. Eosinophil-selective chemoattractant cytokines (eg. eotaxins) are synthesized by lung epithelial cells. Eotaxin-3 is expressed at high levels in the asthmatic lung, predominantly after IL-4 stimulation. Eotaxin-3 is therefore a marker of inappropriate airway inflammation. Polyphenolic (PP) compounds found in high concentrations in berries may have beneficial effects in inflammatory conditions. Plant and Food Research produced high-PP extracts of blackcurrant (BC) cultivars that were tested for inflammation modulating effects. Since high doses of PPs have been shown to cause cell death, we tested two BC cultivars at a range of concentrations in a cell viability (WST-1) assay. While no toxic effects were attributable to the BC extracts (1-50&#181;g/ml), a dose-related trend in cell death was observed and therefore 10&#181;g/ml was chosen for further experiments Ten BC cultivars were compared for efficacy by measuring eotaxin-3 production in IL-4 stimulated human lung epithelial (A549) cells in vitro. Cells were incubated with BC extracts (10&#181;g/ml) and IL-4 (10ng/ml) for 24 hours. The supernatants were then quantified for eotaxin-3 levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All ten BC extracts reduced eotaxin-3 levels after stimulation with IL-4, and six BC extracts were effective by statistically significant levels (P&lt;0.05), (BC cultivars -01, -02, -03, -05, -09 &amp; -10). Of those, BC extracts of four cultivars demonstrated a reduction of more than 65% from the IL-4 stimulated control. In addition, a positive trend in inflammation modulation vs. one anthocyanin (ACN) in the BC extracts was shown. This study has demonstrated the beneficial inflammation modulatory effects of polyphenolic BC extracts, which could be related to cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside content. These results may have therapeutic potential for asthma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blackcurrant</field><field name="subject">European black currant</field><field name="subject">Ribes nigrum</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">airway (medicine) inflammation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1212</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human myostatin precursor protein : structure, function and amyloid formation : implications for the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Starck, Carlene Sheree</field><field name="description">Myostatin is a major player in the regulation of mammalian muscle growth and development, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation prenatally and the quiescence of satellite cells in adults. An absence or overexpression of myostatin results in double-muscling and cachexia respectively, placing myostatin as a promising target in the treatment of muscle wastage diseases. As a transforming growth factor-&#946; superfamily member, myostatin is produced as a precursor protein, consisting of a propeptide region N-terminal to the growth factor domain. Cleavage of the precursor between the domains forms the myostatin latent complex, an inhibitory structure which is exported from the cell where a second cleavage event releases the active myostatin growth factor. The precursor protein, propeptide, and latent complex play important roles in the regulation of myostatin. However, their structure and function are poorly understood, and a possible role for the myostatin precursor protein in the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis, suggests that pre-growth factor forms of myostatin may be additional important therapeutic targets. This thesis presents an investigation into the structure and function of the myostatin precursor protein, the latent complex, and the propeptide region within these, with comparisons to a mutant form of myostatin responsible for the naturally-occurring double-muscled phenotype of the Piedmontese cattle breed. Results suggest that the diverse functions of the propeptide region are facilitated by regions of intrinsic disorder within a primarily structured domain, and that conformational alterations accompany the precursor to latent complex transition, resulting in a tighter inhibitory structure. Comparative analyses between the wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the Piedmontese phenotype is due to a reduced capacity for covalent dimerisation and significant structural alterations within the type I receptor-binding domain. Investigation into misfolded myostatin precursor protein found that the precursor is able to form cytotoxic amyloid aggregates and mature fibrils under partially denaturing conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for the role of the myostatin precursor in sporadic inclusion body myositis. Together, these novel results contribute important information towards an understanding of myostatin structure, function and regulation in both normal and disease scenarios.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myostatin precursor protein</field><field name="subject">Muscle wastage disease</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1408</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A table of metaphors : the visual representation of chronic illness : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gibbons, Ruth Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">For people who live with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity syndrome illness is a hidden construct.

The place of the viewer is part of this discussion. Through visual methods digital photographic techniques and the current interest in sensory anthropology the embodied sensory chronic illness experience is explored. The hidden experiences were made visual creating &#8220;MeBoxes&#8221; and masks which showed both the external and embodied internal experiences of chronic illness.

The goal of PIMD is to establish Farmer Water User Communities (FWUCs) to take over the management of irrigation schemes in their district in order to improve the performance of irrigation schemes and farmers&#8217; livelihoods. The implementation of FWUCs has resulted in both failure and success. Several studies have identified factors that influence the failure of FWUCs, but little research has focused on their success. By employing a single embedded case study approach, this research selected the most successful scheme in Cambodia to identify factors that influenced the success of the FWUC in irrigation management. The findings of this research could provide concrete assistance to the government, donors, and non-governmental organisations in improving the performance of less successful FWUCs in Cambodia. The result of this research showed that the success of the O-treing FWUC was influenced by five internal and two external factors. The internal factors were: 1) the level of local participation, 2) the governance and management of the scheme, 3) the value of the benefits that flow from the irrigation scheme, 4) the quality of the irrigation infrastructure, and 5) the characteristics of the farmer members within the scheme. The external factors were: 1) the level of external support provided to the scheme, and 2) market access. The success of the FWUC required farmer participation and this participation was enhanced when farmers obtained benefits from it. This research also found that access to markets was critical to make the benefits that flowed from the irrigation scheme more profitable to farmers, leading to farmer participation. Similarly, it was also important to make sure that the irrigation infrastructure was of a high quality to ensure the delivery of an adequate and timely supply of water to farmers so that they could grow crops that provided them with the benefits. This required external support from the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, NGOs, and local authorities to help rehabilitate the scheme. External support was also critical for enhancing the governance and management of the scheme through assistance with the formation process, provision of financial resources, capacity building, rule enforcement, and conflict resolution. The governance and management of the scheme, in particular the leadership capacity of the FWUC was another critical factor because it ensured the maintenance and development of the irrigation infrastructure, the timely and adequate supply of water to farmers, farmers&#8217; trust and respect for leaders, and farmer participation. Finally, the success of the FWUC could not be viewed independently from farmer characteristics within the scheme. Farmers tended to participate in irrigation management when they had a history of self-organisation, when they were relatively homogenous, and when they were dependent upon farming for their livelihoods. This research suggests that the successful implementation of FWUCs requires a focus on the seven factors and the interactions that occur between these factors. Irrigation stakeholders such as the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, donors, NGOs, local authorities, local leaders, and farmers should work together to enhance these factors in order to ensure the success of FWUCs.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irrigation management</field><field name="subject">Participatory Irrigation Management and Developement</field><field name="subject">Farmer Water User Communities</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300105 Applied hydrology (drainage, flooding, irrigation, quality etc)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1649</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blind insight : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pfeil, Claudia</field><field name="description">The loss of sight is usually associated with the loss of the visual outer world. Traditionally, total blindness has been defined by sighted people in a negative way. The stereotypical belief is that the totally blind inhabit a dark world in which mental images of the outer world no longer exist. However, gaining insight into an experience of blindness may help the sighted to understand more accurately what Michael Monbeck (1973) terms &#8216;the true meaning of blindness&#8217;. (Monbeck, 1973, p. 157) Blind Insight provides an insight into what is named &#8216;imagined blind seeing&#8217; by exploring the systematic processes of sensing, selecting and perceiving. Through tracing and mapping two auditory experiences photographically, the resulting work, Blind Insight, seeks to give a visual voice to moments of perception and imagined images as described by the blind author and scholar John Hull who describes sound as equating with light: &#8220;This is my way of turning on the light. Sound is the equation to light. Rain has turned the light on.&#8221; (Hull, 2001, p. 10) Abstract black and white photography has been employed to convey a sensory experience and photo collage to make visible the dimensional complexity of imagined blind seeing. The design work argues for a fresh insight into the sensory and imagined world of the blind.

Migrants are faced with the challenges of making sense of as well as dealing with these changes in life. This research is interested in understanding the experiences of Chinese migrants in New Zealand as well as exploring how to conduct 'psychological intervention&#8216; work with recent Chinese migrants to deal with the challenges associated with migration. This research consists of two parts. The first part is concerned with developing a better understanding of the way Chinese migrants make sense of their experiences after migrating to New Zealand. In this part, focus groups were held and a discursive approach was used to analyze participants' accounts. Findings from this part show that negotiating meanings for "migration" and "fitting in" is the central process for Chinese migrants to make sense of their migratory experiences in New Zealand. In this meaning-making process, Chinese cultural meanings provide useful discursive resources for Chinese migrants to draw upon to better understand their experiences of migrating from China to New Zealand. Chinese sayings, such as "fish or bear&#8216;s paw", "loss are accompanied by gain", "life is about negotiating loss and gain", are used by Chinese migrants in ways that allow them more flexibility in constructing their experiences in New Zealand. More importantly, adopting a dialectical sense-making embedded in traditional Chinese cultural knowledge is helpful for participants to transfer their discursive constructions from negative to positive aspects of their migration experiences. The second part of this research involves exploration and application of a culturally appropriate 'psychological intervention&#8216; with recent Chinese migrants in transition from living in China to living in New Zealand. This part draws upon the findings from the first part of the research. In the second part, two groups of participants were invited to attend a three-session group intervention. Useful discursive constructions around flexible meanings of "migration" and "fitting in" found in the first part of the research were introduced to participants. A discursive analytical approach was used to observe how participants take up these introduced meanings and to examine the discursive changes throughout the three group sessions. The second part of the research illustrates that participants took up the introduced meanings of "migration" and "fitting in" as a flexible process, and use these to further co-construct helpful meanings to negotiate their 'problematic&#8216; experiences. In all, this research articulates the importance of cultural meanings and cultural ways of making sense of migratory experiences by Chinese migrants. It also shows the importance of building a shared experience, making use of Chinese cultural meanings, and taking a social constructionist approach in psychological intervention work with Chinese migrants. The implications of this research are discussed in terms of further research on migrants' experiences and how to conduct 'psychological interventions' with Chinese migrants.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migrant experiences</field><field name="subject">Cultural understanding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1650</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on the effects of collaborative learning with mobile devices : submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree Master of Information Sciences in Information Technology</field><field name="creator">Cui, Jianbo</field><field name="description">Many mobile learning (m-learning) systems have been constructed to transform traditional classroom or computer-based learning activities to be more efficient and ubiquitous, such as being able to present learners with a shared learning space. The work of learners is increasingly seen as collaborative by nature, and there is more collaboration between learners who have different learning experiences. Although these m-learning systems have promised positive collaborative learning outcomes, there has been little empirical work done to translate them into the learning outcomes which mobile collaborative learning environments can provide, where learners acquire new knowledge by contributing to each member&#8217;s existing knowledge. This thesis investigates both mobile learning and collaborative learning, and the focus is on: learning performance in mobile learning, types of knowledge created by collaboration and perceived learning satisfaction from this mobile collaborative learning experience. Several experiments were carried out to understand the nature of mobile-supported collaborative learning against traditional face-to-face (FTF) collaboration. The results revealed that, firstly, the learning performance was enhanced when the participants were learning collaboratively with the mobile device; secondly, mobile collaborative learning with a shared learning space contributed to shared knowledge generation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile learning</field><field name="subject">Collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Information Technology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1651</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the occurrence of anthelmintic resistance in goat parasites in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies in Parasitology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kamaludeen, Juriah</field><field name="description">Two studies were conducted to investigate anthelmintic resistance in goat parasites in New Zealand. In Study 1 parasites from goats on a farm with a long history of problems with anthelmintic efficacy were used to infect sheep for a controlled slaughter study. Nineteen lambs were acquired, effectively drenched and housed. Each was infected with a mixture of larvae comprising Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Oesophagostomum venulosum. After 28 days lambs were restrictively randomised into 3 groups based on faecal egg counts. Group 1 was left untreated (n=6), Group 2 (n=6) was given a single dose of abamectin (0.2mg/kg) + levamisole HCL (8mg/kg) + oxfendazole (4.5mg/kg) (&#8220;Matrix Oral Drench for Sheep&#8221;&#174;, Ancare, New Zealand) and Group 3 (n=7) was treated at twice the dose rate of Group 2. Fourteen days after treatment all animals were killed for total worm counts. The mean burdens of T. circumcincta in Group 1 was 337, in Group 2 was 68 (efficacy 80%) and in Group 3 was 10 (efficacy 97%). The mean burdens of T. colubriformis in Group 1 was 375, in Group 2 was 220 (efficacy 41%) and in Group 3 was 81 (efficacy 78%). Although the worm burdens in these lambs were low, all animals were infected with each of these two species except for T. circumcincta in Group 3 where only 3 lambs were infected. Efficacy against other species was 100%. These results clearly indicate that a single dose of a combination drench was ineffective against two species and even when a double dose was used the efficacy against T. colubriformis was only 78%. In Study 2 a survey of drench efficacy was conducted on 17 goat farms using the DrenchRite&#174; larval development assay. Evidence of concurrent resistance to benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin was detected in T. colubriformis and T. circumcincta on 11/17 and 3/14 respectively. Only 5 of 14 farms had previously undertaken some form of testing for drench resistance prior to this survey. Evidence from these two studies suggests that severe anthelmintic resistance is common on goat farms in New Zealand</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Goat parasites</field><field name="subject">Drench resistance</field><field name="subject">Haemonchus contortus</field><field name="subject">Teladorsagia circumcincta</field><field name="subject">Trichostrongylus colubriformis</field><field name="subject">Oesophagostomum venulosum</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300508 Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1652</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protocol design for real time multimedia communication over high-speed wireless networks : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="creator">Abd Latif, Suhaimi bin</field><field name="description">The growth of interactive multimedia (IMM) applications is one of the major driving forces behind the swift evolution of next-generation wireless networks where the traffic is expected to be varying and widely diversified. The amalgamation of multimedia applications on high-speed wireless networks is somewhat a natural evolution. Wireless local area network (WLAN) was initially developed to carry non-real time data. Since this type of traffic is bursty in nature, the channel access schemes were based on contention. However real time traffic (e.g. voice, video and other IMM applications) are different from this traditional data traffic as they have stringent constraints on quality of service (QoS) metrics like delay, jitter and throughput. Employing contention free channel access schemes that are implemented on the point coordination function (PCF), as opposed to the numerous works on the contending access schemes, is the plausible and intuitive approach to accommodate these innate requirements. Published researches show that works have been done on improving the distributed coordination function (DCF) to handle IMM traffic. Since the WLAN traffic today is a mix of both, it is only natural to utilize both, DCF and PCF, in a balanced manner to leverage the inherent strengths of each of them. We saw a scope in this technique and develop a scheme that combines both contention and non-contention based phases to handle heterogeneous traffic in WLAN. Standard access scheme, like 802.11e, improves DCF functionality by trying to emulate the functions of PCF. Researchers have made a multitude of improvements on 802.11e to reduce the costs of implementing the scheme on WLAN. We explore improving the PCF, instead, as this is more stable and implementations would be less costly. The initial part of this research investigates the effectiveness of the point coordination function (PCF) for carrying interactive multimedia traffic in WLAN. The performance statistics of IMM traffic were gathered and analyzed. Our results showed that PCF-based setup for IMM traffic is most suitable for high load scenarios. We confirmed that there is a scope in improving IMM transmissions on WLAN by using the PCF. This is supported by published researches on PCF related schemes in carrying IMM traffic on WLAN. Further investigations, via simulations, revealed that partitioning the superframe (SF) duration according to the need of the IMM traffic has considerable impact on the QoS of the WLAN. A theoretical model has been developed to model the two phases, i.e., PCF and DCF, of WLAN medium access control (MAC). With this model an optimum value of the contention free period (CFP) was calculated to meet the QoS requirement of IMM traffic being transmitted. Treating IMM traffic as data traffic or equating both IMM and non-IMM together could compromise a fair treatment that should be given to these QoS sensitive traffic. A self-adaptive scheme, called MAC with Dynamic Superframe Selection (MDSS) scheme, generates an optimum SF configuration according to the QoS requirements of traversing IMM traffic. That particular scheme is shown to provide a more efficient transmission on WLAN. MDSS maximizes the utilization of CFP while providing fairness to contention period (CP). The performance of MDSS is compared to that of 802.11e, which is taken as the benchmark for comparison. Jitter and delay result for MDSS is relatively lower while throughput is higher. This confirms that MDSS is capable of making significant improvement to the standard access scheme.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Real-time traffic</field><field name="subject">WLAN</field><field name="subject">Wireless network performance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291700 Communications Technologies::291704 Computer communications networks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1653</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of a dynamical system of animal growth and composition : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Abdul Latif, Nurul Syaza</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the analysis of the extended model of animal growth proposed by Oliviera et al (personal communication, July 2009).

The increase in built environments have replaced green spaces in the urban areas and the effects of this has been explored by several disciplines ranging from environmental psychology, leisure studies, urban planning, public health to name a few. Findings from these studies have shown that natural environments do play a significant role in human health. However, it was deemed that exploring the influence of nature on human health from a health psychology viewpoint would provide a different dimension to this established link between nature and humans to press for preserving and providing more green spaces in the cities. Urban green areas offer several benefits such as space for exercise, leisure, psychological space for rejuvenating, healing and social connections that are all crucial for our wellbeing. This study explores the many ways natural settings contribute to health and well-being from a health psychology angle. A qualitative design was employed using a phenomenological approach to understand the everyday experience of being in nature/natural environments. Cornwall Park/One Tree Hill in Auckland was chosen as the site for this study. Nine women and men between the ages of 30 and 70 were chosen from this site to take part in the study. Methods of data collection were mainly in-depth interviews and photo-discussion. The data was analysed using a phenomenological approach based on the guidelines developed by Moustakas (1994) and van Manen (1990). The findings revealed that natural surroundings influenced people positively in many ways that contributed to their physical, mental and spiritual well-being. Natural environments satisfied a wide-range of needs, such as providing a place/space to exercise, to be alone and reflect, connect with nature, recreate, heal and socialise to name a few, in green, quiet, pollution-free, aesthetically pleasing settings. The essence of the phenomenon that is estimated to have been captured in the study is, &#8220;human experience in nature from the point of view of health psychology, or human experience of wellness, being in nature&#8221;.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health psychology</field><field name="subject">Environmental psychology</field><field name="subject">Wellness</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1655</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wellington geckos meet Wairarapa geckos : hybridisation between two genetically and morphologically distinct populations of the New Zealand common gecko complex (Hoplodactylus maculatus) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Zoology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Fitness, Josephine</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to use molecular techniques and morphological measurements to set out to find whether a hybrid zone exists between two coastal populations of the common gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus), on the Wellington south coast.

Using four genetic loci, one mitochondrial (16S) and three nuclear (Rag-1, Rag-2, C-mos), I was able to determine that the coastal populations do have geneflow, however each population maintains some unique alleles. Morphological evidence reveals a significant difference in gecko sizes from Turakirae Head and those caught at Ocean Beach, separated by just 15 km. Adult geckos at Turakirae Head are on average 10mm smaller (snout-to-vent) than adult geckos at Ocean Beach, representing almost a doubling in average weight. The centre of the steep frequency clines of four characters is coincident and the widths are concordant.

In Zambia, even though its vast natural resources have been important to its economy as well as its people, their exploitation has resulted in severe land and environmental degradation in most parts of the country. Reliable information as to the exact extent and degree of natural resources problems is critically lacking. For effective control and management of these natural resources problems, timely, up&#8208;to&#8208;date, accurate and complete spatial data are needed. The integrated application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing to model natural resources management data, especially at regional level, is presented in this dissertation. Three case studies in Zambia are presented and free, internet&#8208;based, datasets are used to demonstrate the application of GIS to support natural resource management decisions in Zambia. The results of the case studies show that while data&#8208;gathering obstacles remain in the use of GIS in Zambia, the systems can be used successfully to fill gaps in decision&#8208;making in natural resources management. The results of the case studies have been used to make recommendations as a way forward for the use of GIS and remote sensing data in natural resource management in Zambia. Finally, selected technical issues associated with data access, data incompatibility and data accuracy are identified as important areas of future research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geographical information systems</field><field name="subject">Environmental management</field><field name="subject">Natural resource management</field><field name="subject">Zambia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291104 Environmental technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1657</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Milk production and nitrogen partitioning in dairy cows grazing standard and high sugar perennial ryegrass with and without white clover, during spring and autumn : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Animal Production at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lazzarini, Maria Belen</field><field name="description">Two field grazing experiments were conducted in New Zealand (NZ) in spring (Experiment 1; November 2008) and autumn (Experiment 2; April 2009) to evaluate the effects of feeding a high sugar perennial ryegrass (HSG; cv. AberDart; derived in the United Kingdom; UK) versus a NZ- derived control grass (cv. Impact) on milk production and estimated nitrogen (N) partitioning within the cow. Areas of both ryegrasses were replicated and sown with or without white clover (cl) (HSG+cl, control+cl, HSG and control). A cross-over design with four 10-day periods was used in each experiment, using 15 Friesian cows per treatment per period in Experiment 1 and 5 cows per treatment per period in Experiment 2. Treatment effects upon pasture botanical and chemical composition, cows&#8217; milk yield and composition, and estimated N partitioning were studied. Nitrogen partitioning was calculated using indirect methods. Herbage concentrations of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) were lower in autumn than in spring whilst crude protein (CP) concentrations were higher in autumn. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) concentration was similar in both seasons. There were no differences in the concentration of CP, WSC and dry matter (DM) among treatments in Experiment 1. The HSG+cl treatment had the lowest concentrations of neutral detergent fibre (NDF, 417 g/kg DM) and the highest content of ME (12.6 MJ/kg DM) and tended to have the lowest sward dead matter content compared with the other three treatments. In Experiment 2 both HSG treatments showed higher concentrations of WSC (15 g/kg DM) compared with the control, both with and without clover; the concentrations of NDF and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were the lowest for both HSG treatments. In Experiment 1, cows grazing treatments with white clover produced more milk (1.6 kg/day) and more milk solids (MS; 0.16 kg/day) than cows grazing pure ryegrass swards ( P&lt; 0.01), with highest milk yields being from cows grazing the HSG+cl treatment (ryegrass cultivar x white clover interaction P&lt;0.05). No differences in milk production were found in Experiment 2. Estimated urinary N excretion (g/day) was similar for all treatments in both seasons, although N intake differed among treatments. The proportion of N intake excreted in urine or secreted in milk was similar for all treatments in both experiments. Nitrogen output (g/day) in milk was the highest for the HSG+cl treatment in Experiment 1 but no differences were found in Experiment 2.  Data were combined from both experiments to study the effects of the herbage CP:WSC ratio upon estimated N partitioning between milk and urine. Mean ratios were 0.72 for spring herbage and 2.27 for autumn herbage. As the amount of WSC increased in the diet relative to the amount of CP (thus a lower CP:WSC ratio) there was a significant increase in the amount of milk N secreted per unit of N intake in spring but not in autumn. The breakpoint in the relationship between the herbage CP:WSC ratio and the nitrogen utilisation efficiency for milk production (NUEm) was 1.32, and the NUEm for that breakpoint was 14 g milk N per 100 g N intake. Ratios below this point were associated with improved efficiency of converting pasture N to milk N; ratios above this point were not correlated with changes in N conversion efficiency. It is concluded that the CP:WSC ratio in perennial ryegrass may be important in the partition of absorbed N into milk or urine. A NZ-selected HSG with a lower CP:WSC ratio is likely to have major benefits for pastoral farming in NZ. In order to be effective, a NZ-derived HSG should substantially increase WSC concentration in autumn pasture (from approximately 100 to 200 g/kg DM) whilst reducing CP content simultaneously (from 240 to 190 g/kg DM). The lower structural fibre and higher milk production for the HSG+cl treatment in both experiments suggest that under NZ conditions, best productive responses to HSG may be obtained in management systems that include white clover.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk production</field><field name="subject">Dairy cattle</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen partitioning</field><field name="subject">Perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">White clover</field><field name="subject">Pasture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1658</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss of heterozygosity of the H4833Y mutation on RYR1 gene causing malignant hyperthermia : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Balasubramanain, Diana</field><field name="description">Malignant hyperthermia is a potentially fatal pharmacological disorder and is triggered by volatile anaesthetics in predisposed individuals.

Local energy sources for low and high grade use, including electricity sourced from proposed grid-integrated, on-site, distributed generation will supplement imported network electricity. A unique component is an internal loop grid for lot connection that interfaces with the local network through a single connection point. A decision model was designed as a decision-support tool for the development based on the annual supply-demand electrical energy balance, site infrastructure covenants and a range of economic and technology criteria. Solar and wind resources were assessed for potential supply of electricity to the community energy system. Three demand profiles were developed using supplied and estimated electrical demand data; and included assumptions on thermal performance of the houses, the use of low-grade heat, user behaviour, and appliance use. Supply and demand were analysed as daily average profiles by hour for each month of the year. The decision model outputs were designed to give a graphic view of the system options. The accompanying output datasets also enabled a number of scenarios for connection configurations, load management, and economic sensitivity to be explored for their impact on the communal approach to managing energy. The viability of the community energy system is significantly influenced by managing demand level in conjunction with system size, capital cost management, and tariffs for electricity import and export. Energy requirements could be best met in the short term by installing a site-wide mixed generation system of sized capacity between 5 and 11kW, supported by metering and information technology to deliver management data to the residents. Future research opportunities exist to continue monitoring technical, economic and social outcomes from this unique community development. Incentivising private investment in userfocussed energy innovations is an option for New Zealand to consider in the current climate of market-driven large scale electricity developments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable resource management</field><field name="subject">Solar power</field><field name="subject">Wind power</field><field name="subject">Community energy system</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290700 Resources Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1659</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical approaches to improve the value of the Falkland Islands' sheep and wool industry</field><field name="creator">Miller, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to determine basic aspects of intake and digestion of native pastures by young sheep in the Falkland Islands, and to evaluate practical methods to improve the productivity of these animals. The studies were conducted in support of Industry and Government initiatives to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture. The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations to plant root growth in highly saline and alkaline bauxite residue</field><field name="creator">Kopittke, Peter Martin</field><field name="description">Revegetation of bauxite residue is hampered by a lack of understanding of the limitations imposed on plant growth in highly saline and alkaline growth mediums. In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The choice between rural living and agriculture: Implications for land use and subdivision policy</field><field name="creator">Anstey, Geoff</field><field name="description">In much of Australia and the United States, the almost universal right to have a house on rural allotments has resulted in rural living settlement in areas intended, by land use planning policy, to be used for agriculture. Such &#145;unplanned&#146; rural living has a range of potential adverse impacts, including, among other things, loss of agricultural production, land use conflicts with agriculture, land value constraints on farm restructuring, and changes to the rural landscape character. Given the strongly held community perception of a house as a development right, this research was motivated by the need to understand the effects of that right, in order to assess the potential value of any change in policy. An integral consideration was the influence of the size of allotments with any such right. The research was also driven by an interest in explaining the pattern of unplanned rural living settlement, i.e. why are particular allotments converted and others not? Largely in the absence of previous studies of unplanned rural living as a distinct phenomenon, there was scope for this thesis to make a contribution to knowledge in these respects. The research involved three stages of empirical analysis. Firstly, a Queensland-wide survey of land use conversion from sugarcane production supported the choice of the Bundaberg region as the study area. Contingency table analyses were then conducted into the current land use and other attributes of land in the study area that, in 1980, was used for sugarcane. Those analyses identified distinguishing attributes of the different land use sub-sets of allotments, and informed the selection of observation units for the third stage. The third stage provided the principal basis for fulfilling the research objectives. It focused on logit models of the choice, at the time of sale, between using a particular allotment for unplanned rural living or sugarcane production. Those analyses provided an indication of the role of individual land attributes while controlling for the effects of other attributes. It was found there had been limited conversion of suitable, productive sugarcane land to unplanned rural living. Compared to those allotments that remained in sugarcane production, allotments converted to rural living were, on average, much smaller, of less value, had lower agricultural production potential, and were situated in more undulating and forested landscapes further from Bundaberg. These clear distinctions between rural living and sugarcane allotments contributed to logit models with high explanatory power. The expected productive income of allotments had overwhelming weight and was highly statistically significant in explaining the land use choice between unplanned rural living and sugarcane. This is a notable finding, because some other studies have not shown such a strong relationship between land use and measures such as soil productivity. There was a degree of natural coincidence between more undulating and forested landscapes and lower productive potential. Notably, landscape attributes appeared to be of secondary importance in determining land use. The presence of a house at the time of sale was not a statistically significant explanatory factor for land use. This finding, together with that of limited conversion of suitable, productive land to unplanned rural living, meant there was a lack of evidence to support a change to the right to have a house on rural allotments. The findings did indicate that the allotment area required to avoid conversion to unplanned rural living was different to the area required for agricultural viability. In the circumstances of this study area and period, 20 ha would have been an acceptable minimum to retain suitable cropping land in productive use. This is compared to the 60 ha suggested as necessary for farm viability. However, the potential for changed economic conditions to reduce the productive value of agricultural land, and increase demand for rural living, makes it appropriate to be cautious about permitted allotment sizes. A detailed conceptual framework informed the selection of observation units and variables for the third stage of analyses. The framework helped to confirm allotment sales as the observation units, and provided the rationale for excluding the difficult to measure influences of a landowner&#146;s attachment to the land, and inertia, as explanatory variables. The high explanatory power of the logit models provides support for the approach, which may be useful in future studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770905 Integrated (ecosystem) assessment and management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158323</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the Kanji Learning Process: Strategies, Identification and Behaviour of Learners of Japanese as a Foreign Language</field><field name="creator">Haththotuwa Gamage, Gayathri</field><field name="description">Research into kanji (Chinese characters used in Japan) learning and recognition has given rise to various theories on how kanji are learnt and identified by non-native learners of Japanese. However, an overall understanding of the underlying process by which they learn kanji remains unclear. The aim of this thesis was thus to produce a synthesis of kanji learning from cognitive outcomes and socio-cognitive behaviour to perceived strategies among learners of Japanese as a foreign language (JFL). This was examined through three separate but interrelated studies. The first study examined the use of kanji learning strategies and their perceived efficacy by JFL learners by means of a questionnaire. The second study examined the outcomes of identifying single kanji characters by means of a kanji identification task. Finally, the third study explored kanji learning behaviour in detail by examining affective factors, kanji attributes and the effect of instructional methods on six beginner JFL learners over a semester of kanji study. Analysis of Study 1 revealed three main categories of kanji learning strategies, namely, mnemonic, analytic and rote learning. On average, learners claimed that the strategies they used most were also most helpful. Despite their exposure to Chinese characters, the learners from Chinese backgrounds studying in Australia demonstrated similar preferences for kanji learning strategies to English first language (L1) learners, while learners from Sri Lanka showed preferences for different types of strategies to these two groups. Study 2 revealed that all learners performed better in matching kanji with their shapes than with their meanings or pronunciations (readings). Chinese L1 learners performed better than their alphabetic (English L1) or alphasyllabic (Sinhalese L1) counterparts in matching the meanings and shapes of kanji. Similarity, whether in shape, pronunciation or meaning, did impair the performances of all JFL learners. The findings of Study 3 underpin the need to develop individualised learning styles within the kanji classroom. Some learners collaborated with their study partner in finding solutions; some demonstrated abilities to recognise and assess their own learning behaviour, and others initiated and developed activities for learning kanji to varying degrees. In general, experiences of staying in Japan appeared to have produced negative impressions regarding kanji study. Moreover, asymmetries in reading and writing were prevalent among the learners. In spite of the varied instructional modes exercised on the learner groups, all learners were able to assess the strengths and weaknesses in each method and develop their own kanji-learning styles. Taken together, the three studies reported in this thesis all contributed to deepening our understanding of the kanji learning process of pre-intermediate and beginner JFL learners. These three studies constitute the starting point in the endeavour to propose a framework for kanji learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420113 Japanese</field><field name="subject">330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">Kanji</field><field name="subject">learning process</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">identification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158038</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capability-based Description and Discovery of Services</field><field name="creator">Devereux, Drew</field><field name="description">Whenever autonomous entities work together to meet each other's needs, there arises the problem of how an entity with a need can find and use entities with the capability to meet that need. This problem is seen in Web service architectures, agent systems, and data integration systems, among others. Solutions have been proposed in each of these fields, but they are all dependent on implementation and interface. Hence all are restricted to their particular field, and all require their participants to conform to certain assumptions about implementation and interface. This failure of support for service autonomy is conceptually unattractive and impractical. In this thesis we show how to describe and matchmake service capabilities and client needs in a way that is implementation and interface independent. The result is a service discovery solution that fully supports the rights of services to choose their own implementation and interface. Our representation is capable of capturing capabilities across a range of service types, from Web services to agents to data sources, while ignoring the implementation and interface details that distinguish them. Thus, our solution unifies these fields for description and discovery purposes, allowing data sources with complex language interfaces to compete against form-based Web services and frame-and-slot agents, for example. Moreover, our solution captures all of the most important aspects of capability, such as: the conceptual meaning and limitations on what a service can achieve; what requests can be expressed through a service's interface, and limitations on what attributes of information a service can return. The provision of an interface independent capability description raises the additional question of how to enable a client to invoke the service to which it has been matched, and correctly interpret the results returned; we solve this by providing an interface description that maps from client objectives onto invocations, and from returned results onto a canonical result format.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280107 Global Information Systems</field><field name="subject">700102 Application tools and system utilities</field><field name="subject">semantic Web</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">Web services</field><field name="subject">agents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157966</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese inscriptions: Australian-born Chinese Lives</field><field name="creator">Tan, Carole Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis represents a transdisciplinary study based on qualitative research and critical analysis of oral history interviews and the personal narratives of sixty-seven Australian-born Chinese.

In this thesis we broaden the approach by applying FCA to a number of early-phase activities within the software engineering life-cycle. With respect to the requirements engineering phase, a case study is presented comparing two class hierarchies that model aspects of a mass-transit railway ticketing system. The first hierarchy was produced for an existing Object-Z specification of the system while the second was derived using FCA. Contrasting the two hierarchies revealed that they were essentially the same, however, the differences highlighted specification artefacts in the existing hierarchy. With respect to the design phase, the thesis discusses the use of FCA for the navigation and visualisation of Formal Specifications written in Z. In response to the continued call for formal methods tool support, we implement and explore a prototype specification browser that exploits the abstractions afforded by FCA.

The first incidents in the affaire took place in September 1989 with the expulsion of three primary schoolgirls in Creil, in the north of France, who were insisting on wearing the Islamic headscarf (known in French as the 'foulard') to school. Their actions were deemed contrary to the fundamental Republican principle of secularism in public schools, and the events were reported in several newspapers, before becoming a national controversy in media around the country. In this case, however, it was difficult to know how to interpret and apply la&#239;cit&#233; in the context of a modern public school in the French Republic. The principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, is a central tenet of French public policy, and public education in particular. La&#239;cit&#233; also represents a set of social and cultural values which have profound historical resonances for many French people. At the same time, the public schools were unsure of how to negotiate their students&#146; freedom of religious expression, which, according to historical and legislative texts, is protected and upheld by the concept of la&#239;cit&#233;, while also ensuring that the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; was maintained. In a bid to resolve the uncertainty, France&#146;s highest administrative court, the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat, handed down a legal opinion in November 1989 in which it stated that the wearing of religious signs in public schools was not by itself incompatible with la&#239;cit&#233; in France, although the religious signs could be prohibited in certain circumstances. In addition, various ministerial circulars were issued by successive Education Ministers between 1989 and 1994 to advise schools on how the law was to be interpreted and applied in this matter. One of the circulars, issued in 1994 by Fran&#231;ois Bayrou, encouraged schools to prohibit the wearing of the foulard and to apply strict penalties if Muslim girls continued to wear it. These measures resulted in an increase in the number of Muslim schoolgirls expelled for wearing the foulard, as well as in the numbers of public protests against the expulsions and the circular itself. Some of the schoolgirls and their families appealed against the expulsion decisions, and their cases appeared before France&#146;s administrative courts over the years between 1992 and 1997. My thesis examines the key legal and administrative texts in the affaire du foulard, including the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat&#146;s 1989 legal opinion and the ministerial circulars, noting the legal implications of successive circulars and the shifts in government policy which they represented. In addition, my thesis analyses the transcripts of many of the legal judgements in the &#147;headscarf&#148; legal cases. These judgements were important not only in deciding the future education of the schoolgirls, but also in clarifying the 1989 opinion. They established a consistent set of principles to define the circumstances in which wearing religious signs such as the foulard was considered compatible or not with la&#239;cit&#233; in public schools. The results of this analysis indicate that, contrary to popular opinion in relation to the affaire du foulard, the majority of cases were decided in the Muslim girls&#146; favour and upheld their right to wear a religious sign such as the Islamic headscarf at school. Recently, however, the legal regime in France governing the wearing of religious signs has changed. In early 2004, a new law on secularism was passed by the French Parliament to prohibit the wearing of the foulard (and indeed all visible religious signs) in public schools. The law has been welcomed by many sectors of the French community, but has also provoked extensive public protests. The passage of the new law does not alter either the analytical work or the conclusions of this thesis. Rather, the thesis offers an insight into the background of the affaire du foulard and thus a more informed appreciation of the potential legal and social consequences of the 2004 law in future years. The principal aim of this thesis is to provide a careful account of the institutions and operation of the principle of secularism, or la&#239;cit&#233;, in France. My research also explains some of the complexities of the legislative regime established by the Conseil d&#146;&#201;tat and the administrative courts, who worked to balance priorities of freedom of religion and la&#239;cit&#233; as well as to protect the education of many expelled Muslim schoolgirls, and in so doing, my thesis highlights the complexity of the principle of la&#239;cit&#233; itself.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390305 Law and Society</field><field name="subject">780106 Political science and public policy</field><field name="subject">Secular</field><field name="subject">secularism</field><field name="subject">la&#239;cit&#233;</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Islamic</field><field name="subject">veil</field><field name="subject">headscarf</field><field name="subject">hijab</field><field name="subject">foulard</field><field name="subject">affaire du foulard</field><field name="subject">secularism law</field><field name="subject">separation of Church and State</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158015</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into Smart Antennas for CDMA Wireless Systems</field><field name="creator">Durrani, Salman</field><field name="description">Over the last few years, wireless cellular communications has experienced rapid growth in the demand for provision of high data rate wireless multimedia services. This fact motivates the need to find ways to improve the spectrum efficiency of wireless communication systems. Smart or adaptive antennas have emerged as a promising technology to enhance the spectrum efficiency of present and future wireless communications systems by exploiting the spatial domain. The aim of this thesis is to investigate smart antenna applications for Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) systems. CDMA is chosen as the platform for this thesis work since it has been adopted as the air-interface technology by the Third Generation (3G) wireless communication systems. The main role of smart antennas is to mitigate Multiple Access Interference (MAI) by beamforming (i.e. spatial filtering) operation. Therefore, irrespective of a particular wireless communication system, it is important to consider whether a chosen array configuration will enable optimal performance. In this thesis an initial assessment is carried out considering linear and circular array of dipoles, that can be part of a base station antenna system. A unified and systematic approach is proposed to analyse and compare the interference rejection capabilities of the two array configurations in terms of the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) at the array output. The theoretical framework is then extended to include the effect of mutual coupling, which is modelled using both analytical and simulation methods. Results show that when the performance is averaged over all angles of arrival and mutual coupling is negligible, linear arrays show similar performance as circular arrays. Thus in the remaining part of this thesis, only linear arrays are considered. In order to properly evaluate the performance of smart antenna systems, a realistic channel model is required that takes into account both temporal and spatial propagation characteristics of the wireless channel. In this regard, a novel parameterized physical channel model is proposed in this thesis. The new model incorporates parameters such as user mobility, azimuth angle of arrival, angle spread and Doppler frequency, which have critical influence on the performance of smart antennas. A mathematical formulation of the channel model is presented and the proposed model is implemented in software using Matlab. The statistics of the simulated channels are analysed and compared with theory to confirm that the proposed model can accurately simulate Rayleigh and Rician fading characteristics. To assist system planners in the design and deployment of smart antennas, it is important to develop robust analytical tools to assess the impact of smart antennas on cellular systems. In this thesis an analytical model is presented for evaluating the Bit Error Rate (BER) of a DS-CDMA system employing an array antenna operating in Rayleigh and Rician fading environments. The DS-CDMA system is assumed to employ noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation, which is relevant to IS-95 CDMA and cdma2000. Using the analytical model, an expression of the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) at the output of the smart antenna receiver is derived, which allows the BER to be evaluated using a closed-form expression. The proposed model is shown to provide good agreement with the (computationally intensive) Monte Carlo simulation results and can be used to rapidly calculate the system performance for suburban and urban fading environments. In addition to MAI, the performance of CDMA systems is limited by fast fading. In this context, a hybrid scheme of beamforming and diversity called Hierarchical Beamforming (HBF) is investigated in this thesis to jointly combat MAI and fading. The main idea behind HBF is to divide the antenna elements into widely separated groups to form subbeamforming arrays. The performance of a hierarchical beamforming receiver, applied to an IS-95 CDMA system, is compared with smart antenna (conventional beamforming) receiver and the effect of varying the system and channel parameters is studied. The simulation results show that the performance of hierarchical beamforming is sensitive to the operating conditions, especially the value of the azimuth angle spread. The work presented in this thesis has been published in part in several journals and refereed conference papers, which reflects the originality and significance of the thesis contributions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291701 Antenna Technology</field><field name="subject">280404 Numerical Analysis</field><field name="subject">671301 Broadcasting equipment</field><field name="subject">671399 Communication equipment not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Smart antennas</field><field name="subject">code division multiple access</field><field name="subject">mutual coupling</field><field name="subject">bit error rate</field><field name="subject">channel modelling</field><field name="subject">hierarchical beamforming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157982</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on charcoal rot of mungbean</field><field name="creator">Fuhlbohm, Michael John</field><field name="description">The fungus Macrophomina phaseolina is the causal agent of several diseases of mungbean (Vigna radiata). One of these diseases, known as charcoal rot, causes spoilage of germinating seed lots, and occurs when seed contaminated with M. phaseolina is used for sprouting. The detection of the pathogen during seed testing prior to export leads to downgrading of the seed and a resultant financial penalty to the grain grower. The aims of this research were: to determine the location of M. phaseolina in diseased and symptomless tissue of mungbean plants; to determine the mode, site and timing of seed colonisation of mungbean; to determine the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on seed colonisation; to conduct an assessment of genotypic variation of M. phaseolina within single plants; to determine modes of transport of inoculum that contribute to foliage infection and seed colonisation of mungbean; and to assess both pre- and post-harvest management strategies in order to reduce or prevent seed colonisation, or to minimise the process of seed transmission. The location of M. phaseolina in mungbean plants was determined through serial sectioning of, and subsequent isolation from, naturally infected host tissue. A large proportion of the mungbean tissue infected by M. phaseolina was found to be symptomless. Moreover, there were large areas of ostensibly pathogen-free tissue separating infection foci, thus indicating a strong likelihood of independent aerial infections. A selection of 14 isolates obtained from serial sectioning were assessed for genotypic variation with six primers using RAPD analysis. Of the 36 bands that were scored, 78% were polymorphic and as a result, 12 distinct genotypes were detected. Polymorphisms were also detected amongst isolates obtained from the same discrete infection area on single plants, which strongly suggests the occurrence of multiple aerial infections. Various methods of controlled inoculation including soil infestation, pod and foliar inoculations, and artificial seed infestation, were used to determine how mungbean seeds are colonised by M. phaseolina. Additionally, most of these inoculation methods were coupled with a series of abiotic treatments (temperature regimes, watering regimes, application of herbicides) that were designed to initiate stress conditions within infected plants, and possibly trigger growth of M. phaseolina from the infection courts and colonise seed. Seed colonisation was established in vitro and in vivo when immature pods were directly inoculated with microsclerotia of M. phaseolina. At least two days exposure at 100% relative humidity (RH) was necessary to establish seed infection in detached mungbean pods that were inoculated with microsclerotia of M. phaseolina. Extensive seed infection was still obtained when one or more days of 100% RH was interrupted by up to three days at low humidity. All except one of the other methods of controlled inoculation failed to produce colonised seed even when combinations of stresses were applied. Only when the bipyridylium herbicide &#145;Spray Seed 250&#146; was applied to plants following the inoculation of mungbean stems within 13 cm of the pods, was seed colonised by M. phaseolina. This result raises the possibility that delayed harvesting of desiccated mungbean crops may promote further colonisation of mungbean tissue, including seed. Very strong evidence for the colonisation of mungbean seeds after deposition of soil-splashed inoculum of M. phaseolina onto pods was obtained through field and laboratory-based studies. Soil-splashed inoculum (most likely microsclerotia) was also found to be the source of inoculum responsible for the development of Macrophomina leaf blight of mungbean at several regional sites. To further investigate this finding, areas of several mungbean crops growing in naturally infested soil were covered in hessian cloth to prevent soil-splash and assessments of the levels of seed colonisation between covered and uncovered areas were made. Although colonisation of seed in the covered areas was significantly lower than in the uncovered areas, covering the soil did not eliminate colonisation of seed. This result suggests that inoculum dispersal, leading to pod infection and subsequent seed colonisation, occurs not only in splashed-soil but also by other means. Soil transported to the extra-floral nectaries of mungbeans by ants was found to contain infective inoculum of M. phaseolina. Furthermore, air-borne debris and dust collected in a trap contained viable microsclerotia of the pathogen. Isolates of M. phaseolina collected from both sources were pathogenic on mungbean seedlings, and suspensions of ant-transported soil and air-borne dust/debris infected mungbean pods and seed. This is the first report of both modes of inoculum dispersal. All three modes undoubtedly contribute to the total level of colonised seed, but their relative importance remains to be determined. Several options for the management of charcoal rot in mungbean seeds were investigated. Application of the fungicide carbendazim to mungbean plants after flowering significantly decreased, but did not prevent, colonisation of mungbean seed by M. phaseolina. Consequently, this method of management holds little promise for mungbean growers. A large number of weeds common in Australian mungbean fields were newly reported as hosts of M. phaseolina. Isolates obtained from the infected, but symptomless weeds were pathogenic on mungbean seedlings, thus indicating a lack of host-specificity toward mungbean. It is strongly suspected that the use of herbicides to control weeds in reduced and zero-tillage farming systems is increasing the risk of infection in subsequent mungbean crops through the build-up of inoculum in soil. This increased risk of infection may be further exacerbated by retaining stubble infested with M. phaseolina on the soil surface, thereby increasing the amount of inoculum that could be splashed onto plant organs. Surface sterilisation, using sodium hypochlorite, significantly reduced colonisation levels in heavily colonised mungbean seed lines, but the process was not enhanced when a partial-vacuum was introduced to the process. In some seed lots, up to 32% of the seed was colonised only on the seed coat (defined here as contamination), whereas the remainder was internally infected. Surface sterilisation also reduced the overall colonisation of 132 commercial lines by approximately one-third. Storage of seed for one month at either 4&#176;C or 15&#176;C significantly reduced colonisation levels in seed, whereas freezing treatments did not. Eradication of M. phaseolina from mungbean seed was possible through thermotherapy. However, the conditions required for eradication also contributed to large increases in abnormal germination levels and large losses in overall germination - an unacceptable trade-off for sprouters. A combination of thermotherapy and surface sterilisation of colonised mungbean seed may provide a more efficient process of seed treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270403 Plant Pathology</field><field name="subject">620108 Grain legumes</field><field name="subject">pulse</field><field name="subject">fungus</field><field name="subject">disease</field><field name="subject">conservation farming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157963</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Xylophagous Insects: developments in feeding assays</field><field name="creator">Peters, Brenton Charles</field><field name="description">Xylophagous borers and termites that damage "timber-in-service" cause millions of dollars loss annually throughout mainland Australia. I developed field-based feeding assays with practical relevance to preventative action and remedial treatment of infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment. Essential to this work is facilitating a high termite risk by maintaining an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites. Feeding assays conducted in low termite risk areas are unduly prolonged, with inherently erratic termite feeding responses. I successfully developed feeding assays with a high termite risk. To establish whether a physical barrier, retrofitted as a sleeve, could prevent termites from damaging wooden poles, eighty poles were established within Beerburrum State Forest, south-east Queensland, Australia. Poles within sets were interconnected with buried timber to facilitate a high risk to Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt). Mesh sleeves to a depth of 1.5m did not prevent termite damage to the poles. Hoop pine Araucaria cunninghamii Ait. ex D.Don dowels ("dip-sticks") were useful termite monitoring devices on the poles. The depth of foraging by termites has implications for the effectiveness of retrofitted physical and chemical barriers in general. Timber quantity and quality has a pivotal influence on the aggregation of large numbers of feeding termites necessary for baiting work and for producing efficacy data of relevance to the protection of timber-in-service from termites. Seasonal variation in termite foraging was examined. Both C. acinaciformis and Coptotermes lacteus (Froggatt) were more active feeding in summer than in autumn. In general, mass loss followed mean ambient temperature. Suppression of C. acinaciformis feeding responses relative to C. lacteus during summer, particularly during January, is thought to be due to excessive temperatures in the containers attached to infested trees. Termite foraging behaviour and responses to both varying masses of softwood timbers and varying exposure times were investigated. The rate of mass loss was independent of the number of test specimens and appeared linear. Colonies regulate the number of foragers directly according to the mass of susceptible timber available. This phenomenon was exploited throughout the remainder of the thesis. Of particular significance was the considerable intra- and inter-specific variation in susceptibility of softwoods to C. acinaciformis and Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt. The sapwoods tested were susceptible, but the heartwoods were generally resistant to damage by termites. These data confirm that termites are discriminating feeders, and some more so than others. A novel methodology, developed to maintain an environment conducive to sustained foraging by termites during field-testing, is presented. Consistency in timber acceptance and susceptibility to termites is considered to be important in determining the frequency of inspection and the success of bait systems. I evaluate the termiticidal activity of the bait toxicants hexaflumuron and chlorfluazuron for the management of the subterranean termite C. acinaciformis in the field. The Sentricon&#61650; Colony Elimination System with Baitube&#61650;-devices containing 0.1% and 1% mass/mass (m/m) hexaflumuron bait toxicant in dry wood flour (Recruit&#61650;) was successful in eliminating field colonies of C. acinaciformis. Similarly, the Exterra&#61668; Termite Interception and Baiting System with cellulose-acetate powder containing either 0.05% m/m or 0.25% m/m chlorfluazuron (Requiem&#61668;) eliminated C. acinaciformis. Indicators (including "dip-sticks") used to monitor colony health were reliable. By using C. acinaciformis, which builds mounds (epigeous nests) in northern Australia, I was able to avoid the use of multiple mark-release schemes to verify the effects of the bait toxicant on the termite colonies. Problems with multiple mark-release schemes, used elsewhere in the world, are discussed. I continued the focus on bait quality and placement by evaluating termite responses to two aspects of treated stakes, their attractiveness and their susceptibility. Three experiments were undertaken near Townsville and at Beerburrum, with Coptotermes and Schedorhinotermes. Whilst there were no significant differences in the rate of location and foraging, with respect to treatments, differences in foraging, with respect to C. acinaciformis and Schedorhinotermes seclusus (Hill) were significant. Coptotermes acinaciformis displayed greater foraging site tenacity than S. seclusus at Beerburrum. Increased consumption of bait, due to the addition of a phagostimulant, needs to be observed in the field before an increase in the efficacy of baits in a termite management program can be claimed. In Australia, softwood timbers are extensively used in building construction and are generally highly susceptible to damage by termites. I focussed on field feeding assays to test efficacy of borate-treated softwoods against termites and to define "adequate" protection thresholds. Laboratory and field data reported in the literature were confusing with regard to what constitutes "adequate" protection thresholds. The confusion was compounded by differences in termite species, timber species used and test methodology. Laboratory data indicated a borate loading of 0.5% m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE) would cause &gt; 90% termite mortality and restrict mass loss in test specimens to 5%. Field data generally suggested that borate loadings in excess of 0.5% m/m BAE were required. The main contribution of the work to increasing our understanding of management options for termites in the built environment was in resolving the confusion between laboratory and field data for borate wood-preservatives. These apparently conflicting results were explained by the presence or absence of untreated feeder material in the test environment. In the absence of untreated feeder material, retention of 0.5% BAE provides adequate protection from Coptotermes sp., whereas in the presence of untreated feeder material, increased retentions are required. Furthermore, the retentions required increase with increased amounts of susceptible material. Some termites, Nasutitermes sp. and M. darwiniensis, for example, are borate-tolerant and borate wood-preservatives are not a viable management option. The lack of uniform standards for termite-test methodology and assessment criteria for efficacy across the world is recognized as a difficulty with research into the performance of wood preservatives with termites. The many variables in laboratory and field assays make "prescriptive" standards difficult to recommend. The use of "performance" standards to define efficacy criteria ("adequate" protection) is discussed. Whilst the majority of the work involves subterranean termites ("termites"), I examine the question of how to define a hardwood timber species as "not susceptible" to lyctine beetle damage. Aspects of the biology, behaviour and management of Lyctus brunneus (Stephens) are reviewed and a novel field sampling and testing protocol to establish lyctine susceptibility of timber species is presented. A sound understanding of the biology and behaviour of xylophagous insects in the field is essential to ensure that management options implemented in the built environment have a strong ecological basis. The success of this study in achieving stated aims, the need for further work and the implications for test methodologies in the field with practical relevance to infestations of xylophagous insects in the built environment are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300603 Pests, Health and Diseases</field><field name="subject">620304 Harvesting and transport of forest products</field><field name="subject">Xylophagous insects</field><field name="subject">borers</field><field name="subject">Lyctus</field><field name="subject">termites</field><field name="subject">Coptotermes</field><field name="subject">Mastotermes</field><field name="subject">Schedorhinotermes</field><field name="subject">field-based feeding assays</field><field name="subject">preventative action</field><field name="subject">remedial treatment</field><field name="subject">bait toxicant</field><field name="subject">attraction</field><field name="subject">susceptibility</field><field name="subject">borate wood-preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157981</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploration and Analysis of the Origins, Nature and Development of the Sufi Movement in Australia</field><field name="creator">Genn, Celia Anne</field><field name="description">Between 1910 and 1926, Hazrat Inayat Khan, a musician and Sufi master from the Chishtiyya order in India, introduced Sufism to the United States of America and Europe. He established a Western Sufi order, the International Sufi Movement, with groups in America, England, and across Europe. In the early 1930s this Western Sufism was introduced into Australia. The aim of this study is to explore and analyse the origins, nature and development of the Sufi Movement in Australia with particular attention to the relationship between the spiritual teacher and the disciple. The study, in its various aspects, and as a whole, makes a contribution to understanding religious change, religion and New Religious Movements in Australia, Sufism in the West and the murshid-mureed relationship. Using what has been termed a &#147;dynamic of religions&#148; framework and Baumann&#146;s model of religious adaptation in cross-cultural circumstances, the study employs a combination of in-depth fieldwork, participant observation, interviews and historiography to identify and analyse both continuity and change in Sufi Movement groups in contemporary Australia. The study found that the early phases of transplantation from India to Europe and America, as well as the struggles within the group after the death of Inayat Khan, substantially shaped the Western Sufism that arrived in Australia. The most significant early adaptations included redefining the relationship between Sufism and exoteric Islam, gender equality, formation of a formal organisation, and the use of music to spread the Sufi Message. Addressing issues identified in the literature on the master-disciple relationship in Eastern traditions in the West, the study describes and analyses the murshid-mureed (master-disciple, spiritual teacher-student) relationship in Inayat Khan&#146;s time, and in contemporary Australia. It shows that Sufism&#146;s development in the West has been interconnected with understandings and practice of this central relationship. The study shows that the continued strength of the murshid-mureed relationship alongside emerging alternatives, the factors affecting change generally in the Sufi Movement, as well as the growing popularity of Sufism in Australia, demonstrate the need to consider not only East-West aspects of transplantation, but also the influences of modernity on spiritual traditions. As well as documenting the Australian history, the study describes the details of the variety of practices and rituals, forms of community and organisation, and forms of the murshid-mureed relationship, found in contemporary Australian groups. This provides insight into the intricacies of Sufi practice in Australia and provides a basis for comparison with other groups. Sufi practice within these groups in Australia includes highly innovative developments alongside preservation of the tradition as taught by Inayat Khan. It also reflects a tension between the spiritual and organisational hierarchy, and concerns for democracy and local autonomy.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440206 Studies in Other Religious Traditions</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158753</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bovine enterovirus: Molecular characterisation and evaluation as a vaccine vector</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, Fiona</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to characterise Australian isolates of bovine enterovirus (BEV) and develop a suitable isolate as a replication-limited vaccine vector. Advantages of using BEV as a vector are that it both elicits mucosal immunity and has naturally occurring temperature stable isolates so that a BEV vector could be administered orally to elicit a protective immune response in the host and should not require cold storage to maintain vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, wildtype BEV causes no or only mild clinical symptoms in its host and if BEV is used as a vaccine vector, reversion to wildtype phenotype would not cause deleterious effects in vaccinated cattle. To date many of the viruses used as vaccine vectors are produced by modifying the structural proteins of the virion so that they contain heterologous sequences. However, each of the four BEV structural proteins are essential and it is not possible to insert large sequences without disrupting the virion. While this study looks at potential insertion sites within the BEV virion, the main focus for the development of BEV as a vaccine vector is through using a replication-limited BEV vector. The development of a replication-limited vector requires the deletion of an essential viral gene that is then replaced in vitro using an expression vector. When the replication-limited vector and its complementing expression cassette are co-transfected into a permissive cell line all the proteins required for viral assembly are produced but only replication deficient genomes are available to be encapsidated. The physically intact but replication deficient viral particles produced in vitro can then infect permissive cells in vivo, resulting in the production of all but the deleted viral protein. Moreover, the deleted portion of the viral genome can be replaced with heterologous sequences within the replication-limited BEV vector. These heterologous sequences can then be expressed in vivo where they can be recognised by the host immune system. Three BEV isolates representing the Australian subserotypes were used in this study: K2577, SL305 and 66/27. The full-length sequences of K2577 and SL305 were obtained as well as partial sequence from the third isolate, 66/27. Sequence homology and phylogenetic analysis showed all three isolates were more closely related to BEV-1 subserotypes than BEV-2. This is the first report to indicate that Australian BEV isolates can be classified as BEV-1. Analysis of the 5&#146;-untranslated region (5&#146;-UTR) indicated that BEV isolates were recombinants with each other and that these recombinant regions correspond to the duplicated cloverleaf structure which is present in BEV 5&#146;-UTR but absent from other enteroviruses. While BEV was initially reported to be stable at higher temperatures, later studies showed that this property varied between isolates and this is also true of the three isolates used in this study. Since it is important not only to ensure that the isolate used as a vaccine vector is temperature stable but also the resulting vaccine vector, the molecular basis of BEV temperature stability was also studied. Using sequence data from the Australian isolates, regions of variation were located and hybrid BEV created. Unfortunately, all of the hybrid BEV produced in this study were non-infectious and could not be used to for further characterisation of BEV temperature stability. Preparatory to constructing replication-limited BEV, a system for full-length amplification of BEV was developed. By including sequences for the bacterial promoter T7 on the positive sense primer used for full-length amplification of BEV, it was possible to prepare full-length transcripts of the amplified product and these were shown to produce infectious BEV particles when transfected into to cell lines that supported BEV growth. Subsequent cloning of the K2577 amplification product resulted in infectious clones for this BEV isolate and these clones were used to prepare replication-limited BEV constructs. To test the replication-limited system BEV structural genes were replaced with a reporter gene to produce replication deficient infectious clones. Complementary constructs containing only the deleted structural genes were also prepared to express the deleted genes.

Eight of 13 nominal benedeniine genera, Benedenia Diesing, 1858 (the type genus); Allobenedenia Yamaguti, 1963; Allometabenedeniella Velasquez, 1982; Dioncopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Lagenivaginopseudobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966; Oligoncobenedenia Yamaguti, 1965; Pseudallobenedenia Yamaguti, 1966 and Tareenia, Hussey, 1986 are revised using type material of most nominal species with observations for some species from new material. Allobenedenia and Allometabenedeniella are transferred to the Trochopodinae Price, 1936 emend. Sproston, 1946 because all valid species of both genera bear septa on the ventral haptor surface. Allobenedenia ishikawae (Goto, 1894) Yamaguti, 1963 is transferred to Benedenia because its haptor is aseptate. I recognize Menziesia Gibson, 1976, based on the form of the male copulatory organ and associated structures and include five species in it. Tareenia Hussey, 1986 is synonymised with Benedenia because characters used to differentiate the two genera do not indicate discontinuities at the generic level. Benedeniella Johnston, 1929, Calicobenedenia Kritsky and Fennessy, 1999 and Trimusculotrema Whittington and Barton, 1990 are considered to belong in Entobdellinae Bychowsky, 1957, pending further studies on that group. The anatomy of Calicobenedenia is outlined briefly; the other genera are not discussed here in detail. Lachishia n. g. is described, based on the structure of the male copulatory organ and a species is transferred to it from Dioncopseudobenedenia. I describe four new species of benedeniines from teleosts caught at Heron and Green Islands, Australia namely: Benedenia ernsti n. sp. from the gills of Symphorus nematophorus; Benedenia fieldsi n. sp. from the fins of Cephalopholis boenak, C. cyanostigma and C. miniatus; Benedenia haywardi n. sp. from the skin of S. nematophorus and Dioncopsudobenedenia ancoralis n. sp. from the gills of Siganus lineatus. Benedenia akaisaki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. ovata (Goto, 1894) Johnston, 1929, B. kintoki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. elongata (Yamaguti, 1968) Egorova, 1997, B. sargocentron Zhang, Yang and Liu, 2001 is synonymised with B. hawaiiensis Yamaguti, 1968 and Pseudallobenedenia arabica Timofeeva, 1995 is synonymised with P. opakapaka Yamaguti, 1966. Benedenia madai Ishii and Sawada, 1938, B. pagrosomi Ishii and Sawada, 1938 and Allobenedenia pedunculata Raju and Rao, 1980 are considered species inquirendae. I examined an outbreak in aquaculture of the pathogenic benedeniine, Neobenedenia melleni (MacCallum, 1927) Yamaguti, 1963 and report this species for the first time in Australia. I examined the pathogenesis caused by this parasite by histology of host tissue. Possible routes of introduction to the farm in question are investigated and studies are detailed that should be undertaken in Australia to manage future outbreaks of N. melleni. Capsalids usually colonise new hosts by an infective ciliated oncomiracidium. An experiment was conducted to ascertain whether cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus could transfer adult skin-parasitic monogeneans from one host fish to another. I have shown that transmission of adult monogeneans between two individuals of Hemigymnus melapterus by cleaner fish can occur. In coral reef environments, frequent contact between unrelated hosts involved in cleaning interactions might create previously unsuspected evolutionary pressures. I discuss the implications of this discovery for host-specificity and lateral transmission of monogeneans. General biological studies of monogeneans are necessary to understand the evolution, pathology, epidemiology, phylogeny and taxonomy of these parasites. My study provides a taxonomic system which, when applied to other capsalid subfamilies, should help prevent errors and create a clear system of classification for the entire family.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Benedeniinae</field><field name="subject">Capsalidae</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">parasite</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157960</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Sulphate Reduction in Anaerobic Wastewater Treatment Systems</field><field name="creator">Haris, Abdul</field><field name="description">Municipal wastewater and industrial wastewaters like those effluents from brewery, citric acid production, tannery, pulp and paper industry, and mussel processing contain sulphate ranging from 20 mg.L-1 to 11400 mg.L-1. When these wastewaters are treated in an anaerobic system like prefermentors or anaerobic digesters the sulphate is reduced to sulphide by sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB). The presence of sulphate reduction is not desirable as it may reduce methane yield due to partial substrate utilisation by SRB, causes system toxicity and the production of malodor H2S in the gas phase. In this thesis, the effects of operational conditions on sulphate transformation and assimilation was studied in a laboratory scale anaerobic wastewater treatment system. The laboratory scale system consisted of two reactors the first one a well-mixed fermentor (referred to as an acidogenic reactor) and the second an expanded granular sludge blanket reactor (referred to as a methanogenic reactor) with pH and temperature control. Two sets of studies were performed; in the first set both reactors were connected serially to represent a two-stage high-rate anaerobic treatment system. The system was fed molasses and operated at temperature of 35oC. The acidogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 6 while the methanogenic reactor was controlled at pH of 7.2 by automatic addition of caustic. In the second set of experiments only the first reactor was used to represent a prefermentor and the first stage of the two stage. The reactor was fed with glucose at various concentrations, operated at pH of 6 and temperature of 35oC. Information gained from these studies was encapsulated in a mathematical model to describe sulphate reduction in anaerobic treatment systems. This model was also validated using data generated from the experiments. The experimental study showed that &#183; At low sulphate concentrations of about 250 mg.L-1 and COD concentration of 10,000 mg.L-1 in feed, relatively high percentage (up to 35 %) of produced sulphide was assimilated by biomass, while the rest of the sulphur was distributed as unconverted sulphate, dissolved sulphide, H2S gas and to a lesser extent as metallic sulphide precipitates. &#183; The major electron donor for sulphate reduction in both the acidogenic and the methanogenic reactor was hydrogen gas. Therefore, sulphate reduction not only competed with hydrogen utilising methanogens for the available hydrogen, but also changed the distributions of organic acids, which were directly or indirectly influenced by the H2 partial pressure. &#183; Sulphide concentrations of up to 6.5 mM free hydrogen sulphide) at pH of 7.2 was not inhibitory to methanogens &#183; Sulphate reducing bacteria were able to grow even at a low hydraulic retention time of 1.2 hours in the well-mixed acidogenic reactor. It was estimated that the maximum specific growth rate (m) and half saturation constant (ks) of SRB was 1.31 h-1 and 3.8 mg S.L-1, respectively. These values were higher than those reported in literature. &#183; Sulphate reduction was suppressed at high concentration of carbon in the feed. Accumulation of high concentration of volatile organic acids at high feed-carbon concentrations had little effect on sulphate reduction. However, extent of sulphate reduction had a negative correlation with total concentration of biomass. A non-competitive biomass inhibition function was proposed to model the correlation. From this fit it was estimated that a biomass concentration of about 3300 mg-COD.L-1 will completely inhibit sulphate reduction. &#183; Sulphate reduction was affected by redox potential control and pH in the acidogenic reactor. High pH and low redox potential values were essential for sulphate reduction to proceed. At redox potential control of -300 mV, sulphate reduction was inhibited more at pH of 6 than it was at pH of 7. At redox potential values of -250 mV or higher, about 90 % inhibition of sulphate reduction was observed at both pH of 6 and 7. An existing model describing carbohydrate degradation was extended to include sulphate reduction processes. Despite experimentally observing that sulphate reduction only took place from hydrogen, all possible substrates for sulphate reducion was considered. These included: lactic acid, butyric acid, propionic acid, acetic acid and hydrogen. Kinetic parameters for sulphate reduction processes were obtained from documented literature. Inhibition of sulphate reduction by biomass and sulphur assimilation by biomass were included in the model. A new approach to calculate caustic consumption at given pH values was also included. A modification to hydrogen regulation function was also made to better predict product distributions as a function of gas-phase hydrogen concentration. Model validation was performed using data from dynamic experiments. Comparison to actual data was undertaken on several key variables in the acidogenic and methanogenic reactors such as: organic acid concentrations, gas compositions, gas production rates, sulphate and sulphide concentrations and caustic consumption rates. The model satisfactorily predicted sulphate and sulphide concentrations in both reactors. However, discrepancy between predicted and experimental data on organic carbon concentrations was seen, especially during organic carbon concentration step changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290700 Resources Engineering</field><field name="subject">760200 Environmental and Resource Evaluation</field><field name="subject">sulphate reduction</field><field name="subject">anaerobic digestion</field><field name="subject">high-rate reactor</field><field name="subject">acidification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157916</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge exposed to external carbon sources</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Maneesha Prasaad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to identify the denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge from full-scale treatment plants and from small-scale reactors exposed to acetate or methanol as external carbon sources. Biological denitrification is currently the most widely used, sustainable and cost-effective process to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Increasingly strict effluent discharge standards are posing significant challenges to plant operators to reduce effluent NO3--N concentrations to levels as low as 2-3 mg L-1 or even lower. The lack of sufficient influent carbon in many municipal wastewater treatment plants makes it very difficult to achieve such low NO3--N concentrations in the effluent. An effective solution to the problem is to introduce additional external carbon sources to enhance denitrification. The selection of external carbon sources is not purely based on costs but is also dependent on the possible microbial transformations that these carbon sources may bring about in activated sludge. The most common carbon source used is methanol due to its low cost, but it has been found to cause long delays until an improvement in denitrification performance is observed. On the other hand, acetate has been found to improve denitrification almost instantaneously when added, but it has a significantly higher cost. In this study, methanol and acetate utilising denitrifiers were investigated in activated sludge with and without enrichment in laboratory scale bioreactors. The relevant denitrifiers were identified and evaluated in situ using culture independent methods particularly stable isotope probing (SIP), 16S rDNA cloning, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR). Activated sludge collected from a biological nutrient removal plant exhibiting good denitrification was enriched in an anoxically-operated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) by feeding methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The SBR was operated over a duration of 7 months and the SBR denitrification rate improved from 0.02 mg NO3--N mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)-1 h-1 to a steady-state value of 0.06 mg NO3-N mg MLVSS-1 h-1. At steady state operation the enriched biomass was subjected to SIP with 13C-methanol to biomark the denitrifiers capable of utilising methanol under anoxic conditions. The separated 12C-DNA and 13C-DNA fractions from the SIP experiment were individually subjected to full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotype (Group-A clones) in the 13C-library was closely related to the obligate methylotrophs Methylobacillus and Methylophilus in the order Methylophilales of the Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities), while the most abundant clone groups in the 12C-library mostly belonged to the family Saprospiraceae in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for FISH to target the Group-A clones and Methylophilales (probes DEN67 and MET1216, respectively) and the Saprospiraceae clones (probe SAP553). Application of these probes on SBR biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of SBR denitrification and relative abundance of DEN67-targeted bacteria in the SBR community. By contrast, no correlation was found between denitrification rate and the relative abundances of the well known denitrifying genera Hyphomicrobium and Paracoccus nor the Saprospiraceae-clones visualised by FISH in the SBR biomass. FISH combined with microautoradiography independently confirmed that the DEN67-targeted cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of anoxic [14C] methanol uptake in the enriched biomass. As observed in full-scale operations, the methanol-fed SBR experienced a lag period of several weeks before denitrification performance increased. Using FISH quantification, it was shown that this coincided with the lag phase in the growth of the DEN67-targeted denitrifying population. It was therefore concluded that the Methylophilales bacteria dominant in our SBR system are likely to be important in full-scale methanol-fed denitrifying sludges. The acetate utilising microbial consortium in activated sludge was investigated without prior enrichment using stable isotope probing (SIP). 13C-acetate was used in SIP to biomark the DNA of the denitrifiers. The extracted 13C-DNA fraction was subjected to a full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the 13C-library were closely related to bacterial families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae of class Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities). Seven oligonucleotide probes (DEN444, DEN220, DEN581, DEN441, DEN124, DEN220a and DEN1454) for use in FISH was designed to specifically target the identified phylotypes. Application of these probes on the sludge of a continuously fed denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (CFDSBR) operated over a duration of 16 days indicated a strong correlation between the level of CFDSBR denitrification and relative abundance of all probe-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community. FISH combined with microautoradiography (FISH-MAR) further confirmed that the DEN581- and DEN124-targeted cells dominating the CFDSBR were capable of taking up [14C] acetate under anoxic conditions. The initial occurrence of the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria and the final dominance of DEN581- and DEN124-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community were likely related to the changing in-reactor nitrite concentrations during the first few days of CFDSBR operation. Hence, the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria were hypothesised to have low affinities for nitrite while DEN124- and DEN581-targeted bacteria have higher nitrite affinities. However, it was clear that all probe-targeted bacteria were denitrifiers capable of utilising acetate as a carbon source. The rapid increase in numbers of the probe-targeted organisms positively correlates with the immediate increase in denitrification rates. The rapid response and community shifts observed when acetate was used to enhance denitrification suggest that an intermittent application of acetate is quite effective to temporarily enhance the denitrification capacity of a treatment plant. However, the importance of a bacterial impact assessment of activated sludge subjected to intermittent acetate supplementation is recommended prior to the wide use of acetate in the wastewater industry. The acetate utilising denitrifying microbial communities investigated in the previous chapter were characterised according to their eco-physiological properties using the r- and K-selection criteria. The electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (nitrite) affinities of these probe-identified denitrifiers were used as traits for this characterisation. The substrate to microorganism (S/M) ratio was manipulated to provide high and low substrate concentrations in the reactor to create conditions favourable for r- and K-strategists, respectively. Two factors, namely feeding regimes and sludge retention times, were studied to achieve the desired S/M ratios and enable r/K characterisation. The high substrate affinities and high specific growth rates of two probe-identified denitrifiers (DEN124 and DEN581) did not enable resolution of these two organisms with the feeding regimes used in this study. However, the application of different sludge retention times as a control strategy to maintain constant high and low in-reactor S/M ratios enabled characterisation of the two probe-targeted denitrifiers DEN124 and DEN581 as K- and r-strategists, respectively. The in-reactor S/M ratios applied in this study did not facilitate the characterisation of populations targeted by probes DEN444 and DEN1454. The minor fluctuations of the S/M ratios during a cycle in the SBR operation was considered as a drawback, but conclusive results could still be obtained from the study. A chemostat reactor operation with constant loading and variable flow rates is suggested as an alternative. Conclusively, this study was able to identify specific groups of denitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge when exposed to acetate and methanol. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on culture dependent methods, this study adopted a pure culture independent approach to identify microorganisms in relation to their function, i.e. denitrification. Moreover, acetate denitrifiers were in situ characterised based on eco-physiological properties. The identification of denitrifying communities in this study has paved the way to a larger research project on the optimisation of denitrification processes with external acetate, methanol and other carbon supplements. As such, this study has contributed significantly to the understanding of the denitrification processes by linking process data with microbial investigations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">External carbon</field><field name="subject">FISH</field><field name="subject">MAR</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157995</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">External and Internal Mass Transfer in Biological Wastewater Treatment Systems`</field><field name="creator">Gapes, Daniel James</field><field name="description">A detailed study has been carried out to demonstrate the importance of external and internal mass transfer on the nitrification rates in three distinct treatment processes: flocculent and granular activated sludge, and suspended carrier reactor (SCR) systems. The major emphasis was on external mass transfer, and the impact of system hydrodynamics on this mechanism. Laboratory-scale flocculent and granular sequencing batch reactors were operated for the nitrification of a synthetic wastewater. A two-stage, continuous, nitrifying SCR was operated using the same wastewater feed. Within each stage, biofilm was grown on two types of commercial carriers- the Natrix C10/10 from ANOX AB (Sweden); and the K1 carrier from Kaldnes Milj&#248;teknologi (Norway). Biofilm carriers obtained from each of these reactors was utilised for the mass transfer investigations. The major findings, and contributions of the work to the field of biological wastewater treatment, are described in the following paragraphs. In order to complete the work, a novel experimental tool, the TOGA (Titrimetric and Off-Gas Analysis) sensor was created, which utilises off-gas mass balancing, coupled with pH titration to provide detailed measurement of biological reaction rates. An original method for off-gas mass balancing was developed, within a reactor that allowed modification of the hydrodynamic conditions using gas phase mixing independent of dissolved oxygen control within the liquid phase. This sensor has already proven to be a highly effective tool not only for the measurement of oxygen but also for carbon dioxide and various nitrogen species, and has application for numerous other compounds present in the gas phase of biological reactors (e.g. hydrogen, methane). The application of the TOGA sensor signals to the nitrification process was demonstrated, which enabled the online measurement of oxygen, ammonia, and nitrite reaction rates. The TOGA sensor development underpinned the majority of the subsequent experimental work within this thesis. Dissolved oxygen microelectrodes were also used, enabling microscale measurements to be made in conjunction with the macroscale TOGA sensor analyses. Combined with size and microbiological analyses a detailed study of mass transfer and reaction was able to be carried out on the various systems. For suspended aggregate systems (flocs and granules): A spherical particle model was developed and used to predict the potential for external mass transfer limitation in flocs and granules. The significance of this limitation was confirmed experimentally, by observing changes in reaction rate or concentration boundary layer (in the TOGA sensor or microelectrode study, respectively) upon modification of the system&#146;s flow conditions. Despite this flow effect being small, and only observable under low bulk liquid substrate concentrations, the external mass transfer limitation was concluded to be significant for biological flocs and granules even at higher substrate concentrations. As particle size and the maximum volumetric reaction rate of the biomass increases, external mass transfer effects become increasingly significant. The work highlights the impact of mass transfer limitation on the measurement of Monod half saturation coefficients (KS) in flocs and granules. Without accounting for external or internal mass transfer limitation, KS is seriously overestimated and becomes a lumped parameter, reflecting not only the microbial response but also the mass transfer limitations observed within the system under study. To avoid confusion or generation of erroneous results, care should be taken in defining, measuring and utilising the half saturation coefficient in biological systems where the biomass is not present as individual cells or extremely small flocs. For Suspended Carrier Reactor systems: External and internal mass transfer are both concluded to be important rate limiting steps within suspended carrier reactors. The demonstration of a significant impact of fluid flow conditions on the nitrification rates highlights the impact of external mass transfer limitation within these systems. Application of a one-dimensional biofilm model to the experimental results led to the conclusion that there is little difference between the external mass transfer limitation of the two different carrier types, for carriers grown under the same environmental conditions. However, there was a significantly higher areal nitrification rate observed on the Natrix carriers compared to the Kaldnes carriers. It is the biofilm structure that is critically important in characterising the mass transfer steps. Systems operated under high nitrogen loads, producing filamentous biofilms on the carrier surface, were found to have larger external mass transfer coefficients and responses to changes in fluid flow than those carriers which were operated under nitrogen-limited conditions (producing a flatter, more gel-like biofilm). The structure of the biofilm colonising the carrier surface was far more important in defining the mass transfer coefficient than the actual carrier type used. In a remarkably similar trend to that of the external mass transfer coefficient, the biofilm morphology was again significantly more important than carrier type in determining both the magnitude and response to fluid flow of the gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient for oxygen (kLa) calculated within the laboratory TOGA sensor. These findings led to the postulation that direct gas-biofilm interfacial mass transfer mechanism is occurring within the SCR systems. This hypothesis is an alternative to the standard mechanism of gas transfer from the bubble into the liquid phase, and then into the biofilm. Understanding of interfacial transfer is likely to be important for developing the knowledge of SCR processes. Overall, both external and internal mass transfer phenomena have been demonstrated to create important rate limitations to suspended aggregate systems (flocs and granules) and biofilms grown in suspended carrier reactors. This significantly advances the conceptual understanding of these biological treatment processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670000 - Manufacturing</field><field name="subject">mass transfer</field><field name="subject">biofilm</field><field name="subject">flocs</field><field name="subject">granules</field><field name="subject">activated sludge</field><field name="subject">oxygen</field><field name="subject">suspended carrier reactor</field><field name="subject">TOGA</field><field name="subject">off-gas analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157954</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies in the rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions</field><field name="creator">Thackeray, Vincent Gregory</field><field name="description">Government intervention in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The merits review system is an integral part of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the merits review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for merits review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law merits review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for merits review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the merits review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1,070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for merits review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for merits review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for merits review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of merits review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="subject">Inconsistencies</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">merits</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">administrative</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Executive</field><field name="subject">unaccountable</field><field name="subject">Parliament</field><field name="subject">injustice</field><field name="subject">empirical</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">statutes</field><field name="subject">legislation. breakdown</field><field name="subject">legislative</field><field name="subject">drafting</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary</field><field name="subject">Counsel</field><field name="subject">Administrative</field><field name="subject">Review</field><field name="subject">Tribunal</field><field name="subject">Council</field><field name="subject">Attorney-General</field><field name="subject">appeal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157885</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thor's Hammer Deflected: A history of the protection of power systems from lightning, with special reference to Queensland, 1950 to 1995</field><field name="creator">Mercer, Douglas Roy</field><field name="description">Electric power systems are a recent feature of community infrastructure, little more than a century having elapsed since the first public electricity supply was offered. The speed with which they have spread across the world, and the extent to which electricity has displaced other energy sources in commercial, industrial and domestic applications, has been quite remarkable. The widespread availability of a reliable supply of electricity has become one of the dominant factors in the lifestyle of the citizens of developed countries, and one of the differences between developed and developing countries. Yet not many histories of this remarkable industry have been written, and most of those have confined their attention to political and administrative matters, although technical issues have virtually dictated the pace of development of the industry. In the 1920s, when power systems began to spread beyond city centres, lightning became a major adverse factor in their capital costs, operating costs and reliability, and inadequate reliability reduced the rate of acceptance of electricity supply by the public, especially in rural areas. Although lightning has long inspired fear and wonder, its fundamental nature - the fact that it is an electrical discharge - was not known until less than three centuries ago, and the first measurements of lightning currents and voltages were not made until the middle 1920s, when instruments for measuring the electrical properties of lightning first became available. Intensive research programmes were undertaken in America, Britain, and some European countries from about 1925 onwards, but no research on the effects of lightning on power systems was undertaken in Australia until after 1950. This delay of almost three decades forced Australian power system engineers to base some very important aspects of power system design entirely upon data from other countries, which was of doubtful applicability in Australian conditions. During this period, the uncertainty over basic design data resulted in some power systems being over-insulated, with consequent waste of capital expenditure, while others were under-insulated, and had to be modified later to achieve adequate reliability. It is believed that this long delay in commencing lightning research in Australia was caused by a number of factors, including community attitudes to higher education and research (other than primary industry research), and the belief of many managers in the electricity supply industry that only the major manufacturers of electrical plant, located mainly in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, could successfully conduct power system research. In 1948 the Senate of the University of Queensland decided to replace the Chair of Engineering with four Chairs in separate branches of engineering. The founding Professor of Electrical Engineering, S.A. Prentice, was appointed in 1950 and soon decided to adopt lightning and its effects on power systems as the principal research thrust of the new Department. By the late 1950s, the University of Queensland had become the recognised centre of Australian research in lightning and high voltage insulation. With financial support from the electricity industry, the University completed a new high voltage laboratory in 1960, and soon began to be recognised overseas as a significant contributor to the world-wide search for knowledge in those areas. During the next fifteen years, the cooperative research programme of the University and the electricity industry developed fully, and valuable research was pursued in a number of areas, including the impulse strength and arc-quenching properties of Australian hardwoods used in poles and crossarms, the prediction of lightning outage rates of transmission lines, the causes of high lightning-failure rates in distribution systems, the performance of insulation under pollution conditions, and the validity of high voltage test procedures. The work frequently involved people from the electricity supply industry as well as people from the university, and attracted attention in overseas countries as well as in Australia. In 1974 Prentice reached retiring age, but the principal members of the staff he had recruited continued to produce research of high quality, and of considerable practical benefit to the electricity industry. By 1995, Prentice's principal staff members had reached or were approaching retirement, and the nature of lightning research had changed somewhat, with the principal interest turning to the details of the lightning stroke itself, and to protection of buildings and electronic equipment rather than power systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430111 History - Other</field><field name="subject">780107 Studies in human society</field><field name="subject">lightning</field><field name="subject">electric power systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157883</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attributional style and attributions for child and parenting behaviour: assessment and intervention with parents at-risk of child maltreatment</field><field name="creator">Pidgeon, Aileen Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a program of research investigating the role of parental attributions in the management of parents with anger management problems who are atrisk of child maltreatment. Child maltreatment is a major social and health issue that is associated with significant costs for the individual child, his or her family and society. In Australia, all major indicators of child abuse have increased each year for the past six years, including child abuse notifications; substantiated abuse cases; children on care and protection orders; and the number of children in out-of-home care (AIHW, 2005). There is increasing focus on furthering our understanding of the aetiology connected with child maltreatment and on reducing risk factors associated with child maltreatment. Parental anger and parental dysfunctional attributions associated with parentchild interactions have been implicated as important risk factors for child maltreatment. These dysfunctional attributions for child behaviour and negative parenting behaviour and their affects on parental anger and parenting behaviour are the focus of this thesis. The present research aimed to (a) identify and assess the types of parental attributions that may intensify and perpetuate parental anger and anger-related behaviour; (b) examine the differences in the attributions clinically angry and at-risk of child maltreatment (CA) parents, and non-angry, not at-risk of child maltreatment (NA) parents make for parent-child interactions; and (c) evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced behavioural family intervention, Pathways Triple P that aimed to reduce CA parents maladaptive attributions, anger and other key risk factors for child maltreatment, compared to a standard behavioural family intervention, Group Triple P. This program of research employed an attributional-behavioural model of child maltreatment to identify key risk factors involved in the precipitation, exacerbation and perpetuation of parents' anger and anger-related behaviour. This attributional-behavioural model of child maltreatment hypothesised that the types of attributions parents make during parent-child interactions intensify their anger and justify their negative parenting behaviour. Two attribution measures were developed for this research to assess parents' anger-intensifying and anger justifying attributions. Study 1 examined the differences between the attributions CA parents and NA parents make for parent-child interactions, and the differences between other key risk factors associated with child maltreatment, including parental adjustment, parenting practices, and perceptions of disruptive child behaviour problems. The 82 families with a child aged between 2-7 years who participated consisted of 41 CA mothers and 41 NA mothers. As predicted, there were significant differences between the CA and NA mothers' anger-intensifying attributional style for both negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour, with the CA mothers reporting an elevated level of anger-intensifying attributional style. In accordance with predictions CA mothers, compared to NA mothers, reported being more likely to attribute blame to their child for their own negative parenting behaviour and that the reason for their behaviour was unlikely to change. The study revealed significant group differences on all remaining key risk factors with CA mothers compared to NA mothers reporting significantly higher levels of negative affect, use of dysfunctional parenting practices, and more problem child behaviours. Study 2 examined the efficacy of an enhanced behavioural intervention, Pathways Triple P with CA mothers. Ninety-three CA parents with a child-aged 2-7 years were randomly assigned to either an enhanced group-administered behavioural family intervention program based on the Triple P - Positive Parenting Program that incorporated attributional retraining and anger management, Pathways Triple P, or a standard behavioural family intervention program, Group Triple P, that provided training in parenting skills alone. This Study revealed that both the Group Triple P program and the Pathways Triple P program were powerful tools for change in the selected population of families at-risk for child maltreatment. At post-intervention and follow-up both conditions were associated with lower levels of observed and parent-reported disruptive child behaviour, lower levels of parent-reported dysfunctional parenting, improvement in parental anger, adjustment, unrealistic expectations and potential for child abuse. Families receiving the enhanced behavioural family intervention showed significantly greater improvements on two key indicators of abuse potential both in the short and long term. Mothers who received the Pathways Triple P showed a significant reduction in their level of anger-intensifying attributional style for both negative and ambiguous negative child behaviour and significantly lower child-blame attributions for negative parenting behaviour from pre to post intervention, with evidence of maintenance to follow-up. The specific targeting of parents' attributions was successful in reducing mothers' anger-intensifying and anger-justifying attributions for parent-child interactions. Mothers in the EBFI group not only reported a significant decrease in the tendency to blame and attribute malintent to children for negative child behaviour but also reported a significant decrease in the tendency to blame children for negative parenting behaviour. This generalised shift for mothers to make more benign attributions for their children's negative and ambiguous negative behaviours and to make less child blaming attributions for negative parenting behaviour showed that the cognitive mechanism hypothesised to shift in angry parents did change in the predicted direction. Participants in both conditions reported comparably high levels of consumer satisfaction with their respective interventions. However, mothers in the EBFI group reported that the attributional retraining session as the most useful of the 12 sessions in the EBFI intervention. Contrary to prediction, only one family in the SBFI condition received contact with child protection services for notification for child maltreatment in the follow-up period. Previous research into interventions for parents at-risk of child maltreatment has indicated that standard behavioural family interventions might not sufficiently meet the complex needs of these families. The results of this present study support this assertion to some degree. As has been noted previously, the EBFI condition was associated with significantly greater improvements on key risk factor for child maltreatment, namely measures of anger-intensifying and anger-justifying attributions for parent-child interactions compared with SBFI. Although at post-intervention SBFI families had also improved significantly on many measures, the differences between conditions on the attributional measures were maintained from post-intervention to follow-up. This thesis provides important new information regarding the differences in clinically angry parents at-risk of child maltreatment (CA) and non-angry parents not atrisk of child maltreatment (NA) attributional processes for child negative behaviour and negative parenting behaviour. It represents an important contribution in the development of two attributional measures the PACBM and the PAM that discriminate between CA and NA parents. This present thesis also extends the limited empirical base of BFI as an intervention for child maltreatment (Wekerle &amp; Wolfe, 1993) and provides evidence for two variants of BFI (Group Triple P and Pathways Triple P) being associated with a range of positive changes in parental risk factors linked to child maltreatment. An important finding was that the Pathways Triple P intervention produced more changes more expeditiously and more consistently across the full spectrum of child measures, parents' cognitive, affective and parenting behaviour measures. A strength of the present study was the utilisation of a robust, standard-care comparison condition which provided not only a creditable test for the additive benefits of the enhanced intervention but also provided the CA mothers immediate intervention with a credible treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380105 Social and Community Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invisible Displacement Understanding in Dogs (Canis familiaris), Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and Other Primates</field><field name="creator">Collier-Baker, Emma</field><field name="description">The Piagetian invisible displacement task has been used extensively in the field of comparative cognition to measure representational capacity. In the task a desirable object is hidden beneath one of several hiding boxes via a displacement device, such as a small opaque container. Success on the task is deemed to require that the invisible trajectory of the object be mentally represented and its current location inferred. That is, the task is supposed to measure the ability to &#8221;think&#8221; of something that is occurring outside of direct perception. However, simple associative strategies may also lead to success in the absence of stringent control conditions. Among mammals, only great apes and domestic dogs have consistently performed above chance on the invisible displacement task. There is much converging evidence from other tasks to suggest that great apes have a capacity for representational thought. However, dogs have shown few signs of possessing the representational abilities generally thought necessary to pass the task. Thus, in Chapter 2, four experiments investigated how dogs (n = 35) find an object that has been invisibly displaced behind one of three opaque boxes under four control conditions devised to separate associative search strategies from performance based on mental representation. Strategies involving experimenter cue-use, search at the last or first box visited by the displacement device, and search at boxes adjacent to the displacement device were systematically controlled for. Dogs passed invisible displacements, but only if the device used to displace the object was adjacent to the target box following displacements. These results suggest that the search behaviour of dogs was guided by simple associative rules rather than mental representation of the past trajectory of the object. In contrast, Experiment 5 found that, on the same task, 18- and 24-month-old children (n = 21) showed no disparity between trials in which the displacement device was adjacent or non-adjacent to the target box. In Chapter 3, two chimpanzees were tested on single invisible displacements under the same four control conditions that were administered to dogs. In contrast to dogs, chimpanzees showed no indications of utilizing these simple strategies, suggesting that their capacity to mentally represent single invisible displacements is comparable to that of 18- to 24-month-old children. Chapter 4 followed up reports of children and apes' difficulty with double invisible displacements in which an object is hidden at two non-adjacent boxes in a linear array. Experiment 1 eliminated the possibility that chimpanzees' previous poor performance was due to the hiding direction of the displacement device. Subjects failed double non-adjacent displacements, showing a tendency to select adjacent boxes. In Experiments 2 and 3, chimpanzees and 24-month-old children were tested on a new adaptation of the task involving four hiding boxes presented in a diamondshaped array on a vertical plane. Both species performed above chance on double invisible displacements using this format, suggesting that previous poor performance was due to a response bias or inhibition problem rather than a fundamental limitation in representational capacity. In Chapter 5, I conducted a pilot study examining the performance of siamangs and a spider monkey on single and double invisible displacements. Performance was mixed but provides some promising evidence that invisible displacements are within the capacity of siamangs. In contrast to siamangs and chimpanzees, but like dogs, the spider monkey showed a significant tendency to search at a box adjacent to the displacement device on single invisible displacements. However, the spider monkey performed above chance on an impromptu test of single invisible displacements presented in the vertical format. Further study is needed to eliminate alternative associative strategies in these two species. In Chapter 6, I discuss the findings of the studies with dogs, chimpanzees, 2- year-old children, siamangs, and a spider monkey on invisible displacement understanding. The results highlight the importance of associative strategies and inhibition problems. The thesis presents strong evidence for stage 6 invisible displacement understanding, and thus representational thought, in chimpanzees and 2- year-old children, but suggests that dogs are capable of only stage 5 object permanence understanding.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380306 Planning and Problem Solving</field><field name="subject">Piagetian invisible displacement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158080</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Methods in Reaction Rate Theory</field><field name="creator">Frankcombe, Terry James</field><field name="description">Numerical methods are often required to solve chemical problems, either to verify theoretical models or to access information that is not readily available experimentally.

These issues all revolve around the temporal limit imposed by death. I have endeavoured to pose some questions which have relevance to a society clutching onto traditional notions of an afterlife despite its headlong thrust into a technologically advanced future where ethical confusions abound. In the first chapter I examine the metaphysics of the soul because postulating an afterlife is the conventional response to death anxiety. I have noticed that many people cling to hope of immortality without having any understanding of the metaphysical architecture of this hope. Consequently, from a philosophical perspective, I contrast arguments on the soul by Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas and Descartes. The second chapter emerges from a fascination with Epicurus's theory of living and, derivatively, of dying. It involves a comparison with (1) Aristotle's distinction between energeia (actuality) and kinesis (movement), and (2) the sybaritic hedonism of the Cyrenaics. Although the theme of this chapter is pleasure, it will be seen that pleasure lies embedded in the living project and is an important component in the drive for survival. In the third chapter I reflect on the meaning of life in conjunction with length of time lived. Here I compare the meaninglessness experienced by Leo Tolstoy (because his life is too short) and the meaninglessness experienced by the fictional character Elena Makropulos (because her life is too long). The Makropulos "case", both a play by Karel Capek and an opera by Leos Janacek, was introduced into the philosophical world by Bernard Williams.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">Death</field><field name="subject">Immortality</field><field name="subject">longevity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157928</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins and Evolution of the North-Eastern and Central Polabian (Wendish) Religious and Political System</field><field name="creator">Zaroff, Roman</field><field name="description">The term Polabian Slavs is a generic name applied to the westernmost branch of the Western Slavs, now almost extinct. Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Viable Software: the Intelligent Control Paradigm for Adaptable and Adaptive Architecture</field><field name="creator">Herring, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">The Intelligent Control Paradigm for software architecture is the result of this work. The Viable Software Approach is developed as an instance of the paradigm. The approach uses the Viable System Model as the basis for software system architecture. The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an &#147;intelligent&#148; control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given. The Viable System Model is described. The model is restated as an Alexanderian &#147;pattern language&#148; to make it more accessible to software engineering. A Viable Software Approach is proposed and expressed in the form of a Product Line Architecture that arranges the Viable System Model, the Viable Software Architecture, a Viable Component Framework, and a Component Transfer Protocol into a system for generative programming. An important result is the formalisation of the pattern of the Viable System into the interface specifications of the Viable Component. Three case studies illustrate the approach. The first is an analysis and extension of the Groove collaboration system. This study shows how the approach is used to map an existing system into the Viable Software Architecture and add fuzzy-adaptive user interface controllers. The second study presents the design and detailed software construction of an adaptive camera controller as part of a smart environment. The final study shows how a Business-to-Business e-Commerce system can be evolved and an expert system-based controller developed to implement business contracts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Software Architecture</field><field name="subject">Viable System Model</field><field name="subject">Intelligent Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Control</field><field name="subject">Adaptable Software</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157886</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct and correlated responses to selection in large white pigs for growth rate on restricted feeding</field><field name="creator">Nguyen Hong Nguyen, Nguyen</field><field name="description">Responses in growth rate, food conversion efficiency, carcass composition, residual food intake, meat quality and reproduction traits to selection in pigs for four years, for high or low post-weaning growth rate on a fixed but restricted ration were measured in progeny grown on either restricted, ad libitum individual or ad libitum group feeding regimens. Genetic and phenotypic correlations among the traits were also examined on animals whose full pedigrees comprised a total of 5324 animals. Substantial divergent response was achieved from selection for high vs. low growth rate on restricted feeding, with the genetic means of daily gain diverging by 81.25 g or 2.78 genetic standard deviations (SigmaG). The high and low growth rate lines also differed in ultrasonic backfat and food conversion efficiency by 1.12 SigmaG and 0.84 SigmaG, and by 0.88 SigmaG, 1.10 SigmaG, and 1.14 SigmaG for carcass weight daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage, respectively. These responses were consistent with the moderately to highly, favourable genetic correlations among and between performance and carcass composition traits. Genetic changes in growth rate, ultrasonic backfat, food conversion ratio, carcass daily gain, carcass fat and lean percentage when measured on ad libitum individual feeding were all economically beneficial. The high growth line had a significantly lower voluntary daily food intake and residual food intake than the contemporaneous low line, indicating a reduced energy requirement for maintenance in the high relative to the low line. Genetic correlations between either growth rate or backfat and carcass traits were favourable but unfavourable between daily food intake and carcass fat or lean percentage, implying that selection strategies which place emphasis on increased leanness and decreased fatness would result in a decline in voluntary food intake of the animals. The descendants of breeding pigs selected for high post-weaning daily gain on restricted feeding showed significantly increased growth rates, slaughter weights and carcase lean percentages and reduced fatness when grown in group housing with ad libitum feeding. This suggests that restricted feeding is an effective performance testing approach for seedstock lines supplying commercial regimens with group housing and ad libitum feeding. Carcase lean pH values measured 24 hours post-mortem (pH24) were not statistically different between the selected lines, suggesting that an increase in basal metabolic rate due to increased rate of lean deposition in the high relative to the low line may have been compensated for by a reduction in heat production from other sources such as physical activity. Such a reduction was evidenced by a lower residual food intake in the high than the low growth lines. This supports the hypothesis that selection for high growth rate on restricted feeding does not have detrimental effects on pork quality. The sows of the high growth line produced more piglets with significantly heavier weights at birth, giving a potential for better post-natal growth and higher yield of pork weaned per sow per year than the low growth sows. Body weights of the high line sows prior to mating were also significantly higher than those of low line sows suggesting earlier age of sexual maturity. A non-significant tendency for high line sows to have a lower voluntary food intake than low line sows pointed to the possibility that their lower maintenance requirement as growers was carried over to the lactational phase of life. It is concluded that selection for high growth rate on a restricted ration of fixed amount will produce pig strains with a high genetic potential for lean growth, reduced energy requirement for maintenance and improved reproductive performance, and which will be suitable for growing under a wide range of commercial feeding environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">630105 Pigs</field><field name="subject">divergent selection</field><field name="subject">responses</field><field name="subject">genetic parameters</field><field name="subject">white pigs</field><field name="subject">restricted feeding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157962</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of Arabidopsis DRGs : Clues from the DRG2 interactor PDL1</field><field name="creator">Plume, Andrew Michael</field><field name="description">The GTP hydrolases (GTPases) are a ubiquitous superfamily of proteins with diverse cellular roles. Members of the recently-discovered DRG subfamily have been implicated in human disease and may play a role in cell division, differentiation or death. While recent work in our laboratory has focused on the expression and subcellular localisation of DRG1 and DRG2 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Etheridge et al., 1999; Etheridge, 2002), our understanding of the role of these proteins in planta remains unclear. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) library screen using Arabidopsis DRG2 as bait identified 16 interacting proteins, 75% of which are predicted to reside in cellular compartments other than the cytoplasm. Since DRG2 has previously been localised to cytoplasmic vesicles, this observation suggests that DRG2 could be involved in the trafficking of these proteins to their correct cellular locations. A single DRG2 interactor, DRGIP4, was selected for detailed study and its interaction with DRG2 was confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Based on sequence similarity to Pseudomonas PCD/DCoH, DRGIP4 was renamed PDL1 (PCD/DCoH-like protein 1). Members of the widespread PCD/DCoH family are bifunctional proteins which possess catalytic and transcriptional coactivation functions in different cellular compartments and in different oligomeric states. PDL1 is encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis and shares remarkable secondary and tertiary structural conservation with members of the PCD/DCoH family and is also capable of homomeric associations. PDL1 contains an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) which is functional in planta and is important for interaction with DRG2, suggesting that these proteins interact in the cytoplasm prior to the import of PDL1 into the chloroplast. PDL1 lacks most of the residues important for PCD/DCoH enzymatic activity but may retain a transcriptional coactivation function in the chloroplast. PDL1 homologs in other plants also contain an N-terminal cTP and a PCD/DCoH domain. pdl1 mRNA is expressed at moderate to high levels in the aerial tissues but not in the roots. Accumulation of pdl1 transcripts is light-inducible, and the pdl1 promoter contains several cis-elements which may be responsible for light-responsive transcription. Expression of the intron-GUS reporter gene under the control of the pdl1 promoter generally correlates with mRNA accumulation but reveals tight spatial control of gene expression. Overexpression of pdl1 in transgenic plants does not result in an obvious phenotype. However, downregulation of pdl1 in transgenic plants results in a pale green leaf phenotype associated with a reduction in photosynthetic pigment content and chloroplast numbers per cell. Leaf internal architecture and chloroplast ultrastructure are unaffected in these plants. This phenotype is similar to the arc (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts) mutants and mutants in the chloroplast division and protein import machinery. PDL1 may therefore be involved in the process or regulation of chloroplast division in Arabidopsis. The pdl1 downregulation phenotype is also associated with pleiotropic effects on plant growth. A second PCD/DCoH-like protein, PDL2, was identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence. Like PDL1, PDL2 shares limited primary sequence similarity to members of the PCD/DCoH family but retains characteristic secondary and tertiary structural features. PDL2 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial transit peptide (mTP) and is expressed at low levels in all plant tissues. PDL2 homologs in other plants also contain an N-terminal mTP and a PCD/DCoH domain. The significance of PDL2 for the function of PDL1 and DRG2 is not yet clear. Overexpression of drg1 in transgenic plants does not result in an obvious phenotype, while downregulation of drg1 in transgenic plants affects general aspects of plant growth which may be unrelated to DRG1 function. To investigate the role of DRGs in a different model system, homologs of drg1 and drg2 were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker&#146;s yeast) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). Knockout of either or both genes in transgenic yeast is non-lethal and results in sensitivity to agents which disrupt intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions. This phenotype is consistent with a role in protein trafficking. Overexpression of drg1 or drg2 in S. cerevisiae does not result in an obvious phenotype, while overexpression of either gene in S. pombe results in a slow growth phenotype. DRG1 and DRG2 are localised in the cytoplasm in S. pombe. The results presented here suggest that DRGs may be involved in the trafficking of proteins to different subcellular compartments. This research has provided a foundation for the detailed functional characterisation of plant and yeast DRGs and of the novel PDL family in Arabidopsis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158746</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dynamics of Chinese Consumer Behaviour in Relation to the Purchase of Imported Fruit</field><field name="creator">Sun, Ximing Sun</field><field name="description">The demand for imported fruit in China has increased dramatically since it first appeared in Chinese markets around 1993. Although imported fruit is much more expensive than domestically produced fruit and people&#146;s income is much lower in China than in developed countries, imported fruit still attracts many willing buyers. Conventional concepts such as meeting basic needs or increasing consumer awareness of the importance of fresh fruit to a healthy lifestyle cannot adequately explain this phenomenon, as there is an abundance of fresh, cheap, local produce available in almost every Chinese market. There must be other factors influencing buying behaviour. To explore these factors and to examine the dynamics of the market for imported fruit, this research adopted a mixed qualitative-quantitative methodology guided by the paradigm of phenomenology. The research examined the characteristics of imported fruit itself, criteria imposed by Chinese buyers on these characteristics, the intended uses of imported fruit and their associated consumption values. To shed light on the possible influence of socio-economic factors, the research also compared buyers from two Chinese cities, Guangzhou and Urumqi. The former is one of the most developed cities in China and the latter is regarded as among the more backward and conservative cities in China. The research identified ten attributes that appeal to Chinese buyers. Six relate to the fruit&#146;s physical attributes: that it has better appearance and packaging, lower chemical residues, better or different taste, and freshness. The remaining four relate to symbolic attributes associated with the fruit: that it represents achievement, wealth, personality and social status. Five intended uses of imported fruit were identified: for gifts, self-consumption, children, aged parents and patients. Four consumption values underlying these intentions were also identified: symbolism, concern for health, meeting basic needs and hedonism. However, the research revealed that no single combination of intended use and consumption value drives the demand for imported fruit in the Chinese market. Most frequently, it is a mix of hedonic and symbolic values behind a range of different intended uses that stimulates demand. Pursuing hedonic and symbolic values also leads to the visual quality of imported fruit generally being the most appealing attribute to Chinese buyers, a pattern common to both Guangzhou and Urumqi. These findings make a significant contribution to empirical knowledge about Chinese consumer behaviour. Results provide valuable insights into the interrelationships among product attributes, intended uses, consumption values and cultural values, and would give essential guidance to the development of strategies to market imported fruit in China. The research also examined limitations of current analytical approaches to the study of consumer behaviour. It demonstrated that approaches based on neural networks and fuzzy logic could be used independently or combined with conventional statistical methods to improve the explanation of consumer behaviour in this case. A comparison was carried out between the most popular form of neural networks (feedforward networks) and multivariate statistical methods in terms of their ability to predict behavioural intention through consumers&#146; attitudes towards products. Results demonstrated that neural networks were capable of capturing nonlinear aspects of complex relationships and producing better predictions than conventional statistical models. To explore consumer cognitive patterns, the research also compared K-means clustering with a Self-organizing Map (SOM) neural network in terms of the ability to cluster consumers on the basis of perceptions towards imported fruit attributes. Results indicate a superior outcome when K-means is used in conjunction with SOM in clustering analysis: using SOM to determine the &#145;natural&#146; numbers of clusters and using K-means to do clustering. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate the impact of consumption values, this research develops a new approach that combines Means-end Chain theory with fuzzy logic theory. Given the global importance of the Chinese market, the successful application of neural networks and fuzzy logic in this study of the behaviour of Chinese consumers purchasing imported fruit could have wider ramifications. If the approach were proven in other applications, it could significantly improve the ability to understand the demand for consumer goods in China.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chinese consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">imported fruit</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">fuzzy logic</field><field name="subject">Self-organizing map</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157947</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Viola da Gamba Music of the Berlin School, 1732-1772</field><field name="creator">O'Loghlin, Michael Andrew</field><field name="description">The name &#147;Berlin School&#148; refers to the group of composers who worked in the orchestra of Frederick the Great in Berlin. The first musicians were engaged in 1732, and the group expanded rapidly to its full strength of about 42 after Frederick&#146;s coronation in 1740. All of the most significant composers were engaged in the first 10 years. Most of these composers wrote music for the viola da gamba, an instrument which by 1740 was already becoming obsolete in most places. The gamba composers are C. P. E. Bach, F. Benda, C. H. Graun, J. G. Graun, J. G. Janitsch and C. Schaffrath. They were encouraged to write for the viola da gamba by the presence in the orchestra from 1741 of Ludwig Christian Hesse, one of the last great virtuosi of the viola da gamba. Hesse was taught by his father Ernst Christian Hesse, who studied the French style in Paris. Hesse junior brought the French style to Berlin, where the Berlin School composers produced a synthesis of French and Italian styles by applying French textural techniques, some of them specific to the viola da gamba, to Italian forms. This study shows how the unique situation which existed in Berlin produced the last major corpus of music written for the viola da gamba. This music was the result of close collaboration between Hesse and the Berlin School composers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">Darmstadt</field><field name="subject">performance practice</field><field name="subject">sonata</field><field name="subject">concerto</field><field name="subject">cantata</field><field name="subject">violin</field><field name="subject">Amalien-Bibliothek</field><field name="subject">Staatsbibliothek</field><field name="subject">solo</field><field name="subject">duet</field><field name="subject">trio</field><field name="subject">quartet</field><field name="subject">Versuch</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157961</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potassium distribution in Ferrosols and its influence on rain-fed crop production in the South Burnett region of Queensland</field><field name="creator">White, Jonnie Rachelle</field><field name="description">The South Burnett region of Queensland is Australia's most important rainfed peanut (Arachis hypogea L.) production area. It also produces a considerable amount of cereal and grain legume crops. The cropping soils of the region are red, acid to neutral, clay loams that are classified as Ferrosols (Australian Soil Classification). Over 50 years of cropping on these soils has resulted in severe depletion of nutrient reserves, particularly potassium (K). In addition, the remaining K is predominantly confined to the surface 10 or 15cm of the soil profile, a feature commonly refered to as nutrient stratification. Dry periods during the summer cropping season are common due to the highly variable, summer-dominant rainfall pattern of the South Burnett. As topsoil dries out, crops forage for moisture and nutrients from lower in the soil profile where K reserves are smaller. It is therefore suspected that the combination of dry periods and stratified K reserves have resulted in an increasing incidence of K deficiency symptoms in summer crops. To investigate these issues, K relations of Ferrosols of the South Burnett were studied using soils from two representative sites. The pools of soil K that are important to crop growth in Ferrosols, and their interaction was examined through fractionation of soil K pools, and determination of quantity/intensity relationships, charge characteristics and clay mineralogy, and a leaching column study. A rapid K uptake period was identified for peanut and the effect of profile distribution and soil moisture during this period on K accessibility was studied in a divided column experiment. Finally, on-farm trials were used to evaluate commercial-scale options for improving K distribution in field profiles. It was found that the immediately available exchangeable K pool in these soils was the most important source of soil K, and was poorly buffered by slowly available non-exchangeable K. However the leaching column study revealed that K was preferentially adsorbed onto soil cation exchange sites, displacing calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) ions, and therefore was not susceptible to vertical movement within the soil profile. These observations helped to explain the development of stratified K profiles in these soil types. Peanut (cv. Streeton) was found to take up most of its K requirement between 25-70 days after planting. The divided column study showed that profile distribution, and topsoil iv moisture content during this rapid K uptake period, were able to affect the ability of peanut plants to access K. Plants that grew in low K soil, or where soil was dry at the site of K supply, had reduced access to K. However, improving access to K did not result in improved growth, but rather in a significant reduction in dry matter (DM) production, apparently due to interference in the availability of other nutrients, possibly phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) or boron (B). Field studies showed that application of K and profile inversion improved K uptake and DM production of various crop species. However, in most instances improved K uptake and DM production was not reflected in increased yield. It was suggested that a combination of agronomic factors, seasonal conditions and crop type prevented the expression of yield responses to improved K nutrition and these influences need to be understood. The findings of this project have important consequences for nutrition of crops grown on Ferrosols in the South Burnett region. Surface applied K cannot be expected to increase exchangeable K in the subsoil unless it is incorporated to depth. Similarly, band applied K will remain close to the site of application as a result of only limited vertical or lateral movement. This may affect the ability of roots to access band applied K. The ability of surface applied K to displace Ca and Mg from soil exchange sites may have negative implications for the Ca nutrition of developing peanut pods. On the other hand, it could present an opportunity for the movement of Ca into deeper soil layers to address the amelioration of acid subsoils. The unexplained negative responses to potassium chloride application and apparent effect on P, Mg or B nutrition need to be investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300103 Soil Chemistry</field><field name="subject">620100 Field Crops</field><field name="subject">Oxisols</field><field name="subject">maize</field><field name="subject">soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">stratification</field><field name="subject">uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157923</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Occupational Therapists' decisions about the management of upper limb hypertonicity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy</field><field name="creator">Rassafiani, Mehdi</field><field name="description">It has been postulated that occupational therapists when choosing an appropriate intervention method, use theoretical and practical knowledge (factors), based upon identifying client's goals to guide their clinical reasoning. The overall aim of this study was to identify factors and their relative contributions to the decisions occupational therapists make in the management of upper limb (UL) hypertonicity of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy (CP). Studies about general factors which influence occupational therapists' decision making have been addressed widely in the literature. However, studying influential factors in specific areas such as in the management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP is limited. The information obtained from studies of decision making with other client groups can not readily be generalised as it has been demonstrated that specific task characteristics induce different types of cognitive thinking. For example, working with clients with orthopaedic problems may induce logical thinking, while practicing with clients with neurological problems promotes intuitive thinking. The management of UL hypertonicity of clients with CP was chosen as the focus of this study for two main reasons. First, the incidence of CP is high, manifesting in between 1.4 and 2.4 of 1000 live births. Second, people with CP are one of the major client groups referred to occupational therapy (OT) clinics as outpatients. The literature reviewed highlighted a lack of evidence about what therapists attend to when making decisions about the management of UL hypertonicity for clients with CP. To identify and evaluate these factors, the current research employed Social Judgment Theory (SJT). This methodology was selected because it had the capacity to V access intuitive thought or tacit knowledge that is very difficult for experienced therapists to explain. Furthermore, SJT is most relevant in situations where there is no optimal decision. The current study proceeded in five phases. Phases One to Three were conducted to identify the most relevant factors to be used in the case vignettes necessary for the application of SJT. This process involved a review of the literature, consultation with clinical experts and then involved twelve experienced therapists in a process of identifying, refining, and ranking the relevant factors in order of priority. As a result of the processes in Phases One to Three 37 factors and their ranked importance were identified. The identified factors were reduced from 37 to 12 on the basis of ranking, cluster analysis and consultation with experts and appropriate scales identified for their measurement. These factors formed the basis of Phase Four of this study. In Phase Four 10 sample case vignettes as well as an administration manual were developed and four therapists were asked to make decisions for these cases. On the basis of therapists&#146; comments, some changes were made in case vignettes and administration manual. Finally, 110 case vignettes were generated randomly (20 were repeated to examine consistency) for Phase Five of the study. In Phase Five, eighteen occupational therapists (16 females and 2 males), mean age of 36.7 years (SD = 7.6 years) who had worked with people with CP for a mean of 10.4 years (SD = 6.0 years) made decisions for the generated case vignettes. The findings of Phase Five revealed that therapists used three factors mainly in their decisions including severity of spasticity, wrist and finger posture, and client and family background. They had poor insight into their decision making (r = 0.36) and demonstrated only moderate consistency (r = 0.46). When therapists were divided into two groups based on their level of performance in respect to therapists&#146; consistency and their ability to discriminate between cases, both groups used severity of spasticity and wrist and finger posture in their decision making. However, the higher performing group used limitation in passive range of movement and previous intervention in their decision making, and the low performing group used client and family background. To conclude, factors identified as most important (specifically by therapists who performed consistently) could be considered to be the most critical when confronted by a large amount of information. These factors can be used to assist occupational therapy students and new practitioners to focus on relevant information to help support their clinical decisions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Occupational Therapy</field><field name="subject">Cerebral Palsy</field><field name="subject">Decision Making</field><field name="subject">Upper limb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158056</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Phase Measurements</field><field name="creator">Berry, Dominic William</field><field name="description">In this thesis I consider the general problem of how to make the best possible phase measurements using feedback. Both the optimum input state and optimum feedback are considered for both single-mode dyne measurements and two-mode interferometric measurements. I derive the optimum input states under general dyne measurements when the mean photon number is fixed, both for general states and squeezed states. I propose a new feedback scheme that introduces far less phase uncertainty than mark II feedback, and is very close to the theoretical limit. I also derive results for the phase variance when there is a time delay in the feedback loop, showing that there is a lower limit to the introduced phase variance, and this is approached quite accurately under some conditions. I derive the optimum input states for interferometry, showing that the phase uncertainty scales as 1/N for all the common measures of uncertainty. This is contrasted with the |j0&gt; state, which does not scale as 1/N for all measures of phase uncertainty. I introduce an adaptive feedback scheme that is very close to optimum, and can give scaling very close to 1/N for the uncertainty.

A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anterior-Posterior Ground Reaction Force Characteristics for Post-Block Foot Contacts in Sprint Running</field><field name="creator">Watts, Mark Charles</field><field name="description">Past research on the acceleration phase in sprint running has concentrated on the kinematics of sprint blocks set-up and the initial steps after exiting the sprint blocks. In contrast, there has been limited research on the ground reaction forces (GRF) generated during the initial post-block foot contacts. These initial foot contacts in sprinting are important for optimising performance in the initial acceleration phase of sprinting. However, little is known about the GRF elite sprinters generate during the initial foot contacts and how these GRF characteristics relate to performance. It is the anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF that are of most importance as they indicate the sprinter&#146;s motion from the start to the finish line. This thesis investigates the A-P GRF of the first two foot contacts of the sprint start after leaving the blocks. The participants included seventeen male and six female sprinters with a mean age of 22.6 (SD 4.4 years). Seventeen of the sprinters had competed at international/national level competitions and six at recreational/amateur level competitions. The athletes were classified as senior male elite (SME), senior female elite (SFE), junior male elite (JME) and senior male recreational (SMR). The sprinters were instructed to perform block starts at maximal effort to produce the fastest time over 5 metres on a 30 metre indoor laboratory track. Timing gates were used to record 5 metre times and two strain gauge force plates were placed in series to collect GRF data from the first two foot contacts after leaving the starting blocks. From the GRF data, braking time, maximum A-P braking force, A-P braking impulse, propulsive time, maximum A-P propulsive force, A-P propulsive impulse and A-P contact impulse were determined for each trial. The A-P propulsive phase constituted greater than 90% of the total contact time, had approximately twice the magnitude of the maximum force of the braking phase and accounted for more than 95% of the total contact impulse across the four groups of sprinters. The SME group produced a significantly larger A-P propulsive impulse on the first and second steps compared to the SFE (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively), JME (not significant and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The SME group&#146;s maximum A-P propulsive force was significantly larger on the first and second steps than the SFE (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively), JME (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The SME group&#146;s propulsive time on the first and second steps was not significantly different compared to the SFE (both not significant) but was significantly shorter compared to the JME (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The maximum A-P propulsive force correlated strongly with 5 metre time for the first step (rs = -0.670, p less than 0.01), second step (rs = -0.621, p less than 0.01) and the addition of the first and second steps (rs = -0.678, p less than 0.01) across all the sprinters. Whereas, the A-P propulsive impulse correlated strongly with 5 metre time for the first step (rs = -0.525, p less than 0.01), second step (rs = -0.592, p less than 0.01) and the addition of the first and second steps (rs = -0.584, p less than 0.01). Three A-P GRF patterns were observed during the first and second foot contacts of the sprinters examined in this study. A braking-propulsive (B-P) pattern was the most frequently observed followed by a propulsive-braking-propulsive (P-B-P) and a no braking (NB) pattern 82.7%, 15.4% and 1.9% respectively. The P-B-P and NB patterns, which have not been described previously, appeared most frequently in the least experienced sprinters. In the past, some sprinters and their coaches have tried to minimise the braking phase and maximise the propulsive phase of the first two foot contacts after exiting the blocks during sprinting. This study suggests that increasing the maximum propulsive force is the best way to increase performance over the first 5 metres of the acceleration phase. The research also suggests that there will be little benefit gained from trying to increase performance by focusing on the braking phase during these first two steps after exiting the blocks. As such, sprinters and coaches should focus their attention primarily on producing a large A-P propulsive force during the first two steps of a sprint.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321405 Sports Medicine</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="subject">running</field><field name="subject">sprint</field><field name="subject">post-block</field><field name="subject">foot contacts</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157980</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to International Terrorism: The Contribution of the United Nations</field><field name="creator">Emma Kennedy Da Silva</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">united nations, international terrorism, multilateralism, unilateralism, international relations, cooperation, institutions, security</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Centre Sites: The New Gatekeepers of the Web?</field><field name="creator">Bruns, Axel</field><field name="description">This thesis introduces and analyses the emerging Website genre of Resource Centre Sites. RCSs are sites which combine news, rumours and background information as well as community discussion and commentary on their chosen topic, and frequently serve as a first point of entry for readers interested in learning more about the field. They also offer spaces for virtual communities of specialists or enthusiasts to emerge, who in the process and as a product of their interaction on these sites collate detailed resource collections and hyperlink directories for their fields of interest. Therefore, Resource Centre Sites significantly involve their users as content contributors and producers, turning them into what is here termed &#145;produsers&#146; of the site. Aiming to evaluate all the content relevant to their field that is becoming available online, and to coopt or at least link to this information from the news and resources collection that is a central part of the RCS, Resource Centre Site produsers engage in an adaptation of both traditional journalistic gatekeeping methodologies and librarianly resource collection approaches to the Web environment: in the absence of gates to keep online, they have become &#145;gatewatchers&#146;, observing the publication of news and information in other sources and publicising its existence through their own sites. Their operation is studied here through a number of case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites from various fields of interest. These sites are analysed both based on their available Web content, and using background information obtained in a series of email interviews with RCS creators. In combination, this offers insights into the operating philosophies of sites and site editors, and provides an opportunity to assess to what extent these ideas have been translated into everyday practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of past and current theoretical views of the Web in an effort to evaluate their suitability for the current study. Older approaches positing an abstract &#145;ideal&#146; form of hypertext are rejected in favour of a direct engagement with the World Wide Web as the now dominant mode of hypertextuality. Chapter 2 outlines the principles of gatewatching in contrast to traditional methods of evaluating news and information as they exist in journalistic media and archival institutions, and investigates the effects such gatewatching practices may have on editors and users. Chapter 3 describes the overall characteristics of Resource Centre Sites as a genre of Web publications. It notes the special role site users play in the operation of such sites (in their new role as &#145;produsers&#146;), and distinguishes the RCS genre from similar Website models such as portals and cybermediaries. Chapter 4 observes the everyday operation of such Websites in practice, using case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites including Slashdot, MediaChannel and CountingDown, and interviews with their creators. (These interviews are included in full in the Appendix.) This analysis works with both a synchronic view to the variety of topics existing Resource Centre Sites are able to address, and a diachronic view to the evolution of proto-RCSs (such as enthusiast community or online advocacy sites) into fully-featured Resource Centre Sites. Finally, based on this analysis, Chapter 5 is then able to point out some of the implications and effects that increasing use of this media form may have on its users and the network of news and information publications on- and offline, and to indicate the potential for further developments of the site genre.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">751004 The media</field><field name="subject">420399 Cultural Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Web</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">WWW</field><field name="subject">hypertext</field><field name="subject">hypermedia</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">online publishing</field><field name="subject">online communities</field><field name="subject">virtual</field><field name="subject">virtual communities</field><field name="subject">open source</field><field name="subject">Resource Centre Sites</field><field name="subject">RCS</field><field name="subject">RCSs</field><field name="subject">gatekeeping</field><field name="subject">gatewatching</field><field name="subject">produsers</field><field name="subject">portals</field><field name="subject">virtual settlements</field><field name="subject">online journalism</field><field name="subject">MediaChannel</field><field name="subject">HIV InSite</field><field name="subject">GameGirlz</field><field name="subject">GrrlGamer</field><field name="subject">Womengamers</field><field name="subject">Countingdown.com</field><field name="subject">Slashdot</field><field name="subject">Amiga.org</field><field name="subject">Slashcode</field><field name="subject">PHP-Nuke</field><field name="subject">Postnuke</field><field name="subject">Axel Bruns</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157907</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paradox of Identity Security and Recourse to Violence in Liberal Democracy</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Bryn Wagner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security, liberal democracy, identity, political violence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159529</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of N-qubit chains</field><field name="creator">Mr Courtney Mewton</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159582</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bifurcations, Phase Transitions and Teleportation in Entangled Quantum Systems</field><field name="creator">John Paul Barjaktarevic</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159638</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictions and perspectives: Exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and substance use by young males and females.</field><field name="creator">Ms Kim Johnston</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a time of experimentation and exploration. For many young people, a feature of this developmental period is the initiation of substance use. Whilst the majority of young people do not go on to develop substance use problems, any substance use has potential for danger. The current body of literature on the prevention of substance use problems suggests that in order to advance understanding, researchers must adopt a risk-focused approach. There is a wide range of indices that have been cited as risk factors for the development of substance use disorders. Chapter 2 explores some of the aetiological models and literature on risk factors with specific reference to psychological wellbeing, studies highlighting comorbid relationships between adolescent mental health and substance use problems, and the functional value of substances in relation to well-being. Although attention to psychological risk factors has received increased press in the literature, the number of controlled, longitudinal studies is relatively small. A review of recent studies (Chapter 3) indicates that the presence of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or behavioural problems such as delinquency represent psychological risk factors for the development of later substance use problems, however findings are inconsistent and many studies do not examine differential predictive utility by substance or gender. Thus, Study 1 of this research aimed to add to this body of work by exploring the prediction of alcohol, cannabis and other illicit substance use at age fifteen from key indicators of psychological well-being taken at age thirteen. The data from a normative sample of high school students indicated subtle differences in trajectory for young males and females and effects specific to different drug categories. Delinquency emerged as the most consistent predictor in both males and females. Low self-esteem was also an important indicator for future female marijuana use and marijuana intoxication and both male and female other illicit substance use. The findings highlighted the need for a greater contextual understanding of the relationship between delinquency, self-esteem and substance use. The second study sought to provide a deeper understanding of these issues by examining the perceived functional value of substances in relation to psychological wellbeing, by means of a qualitative study of a group of young people who had experienced problems with their substance use. Chapter 4 explores the limited phenomenological research in this area, with a focus on studies which have used methods of measurement that highlight the perspective of young people. Using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach, Study 2 builds on the drug type and gender contrasts noted in Study 1, and explores the interface between substance use and psychological well-being in depth using a clinical population. A number of key functions are identified by young people, with evidence of both convergence and divergence across drug categories (alcohol, cannabis, other illicit substances). Interviewees reported six functions common to all substances; social connectedness, improve affect, positive self-transformation, better coping with problems, fun and laughter, and feeling intoxicated. Nine additional functions were identified in relation to cannabis and other illicit substances. Several gender differences were also noted, with males tending to report more positive reinforcement from alcohol and cannabis, and young females more frequently describing benefits related to use of other illicit substances. The concluding chapter (Chapter 5) reviews the main findings across both studies and their implications for theory, practice, and future research. Overall, the findings of the research provide support for both problem behaviour and adaptive models of adolescent substance use, and indicate that young people are capable of reflecting on their substance use experiences. Incorporating the wisdom of young people into risk frameworks may enhance prevention, education and intervention efforts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent, substance misuse, psychological well-being, consensual qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161713</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decolonizing Feminism</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Wex</field><field name="description">The task of attending to cultural difference amongst women while also &#8216;bridging&#8217; these differences is deeply contested in feminism. This concern arose in response to criticisms that &#8216;hegemonic&#8217; feminism is indeed part of the colonial project. These critiques demonstrated that the notion of feminism as a universal movement for all women is deeply problematic and founded on the exclusion of sex, race, and class differences. Subsequently, the aim to recuperate a notion of the universal that refuses these exclusions is of central concern to contemporary feminism. As feminism comes to grip with the impact of globalization on women in different parts of the world, this impetus to engender understanding and alliances across cultural difference is more salient than ever. This thesis explores one response to the dilemma which I term the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217;. Only recently emerging from the field of contemporary feminist theory, this impulse and the key authors which inform it has not be examined in any substantial way. This is where the original contribution of this thesis lies. My main focus is to explore the central aim of this emerging set of ideas and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. I argue that the central aim of the decolonizing impulse is to build feminist alliances and coalitions that are premised, first and foremost, on women&#8217;s heterogeneity. It thus purports to offer a re-constructed vision of the &#8216;universal&#8217;. This is a universalism where differences and particularities are privileged in advance of any announcement of the &#8216;universal&#8217;. To do this, I first establish how the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217; emerged from different fields of scholarship, including postcolonial studies, indigenous political thought, Third World, postcolonial and poststructuralist feminisms. I then map the major features of the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217; by examining the work of important authors who have given shape to this impulse. To discover the strengths and weaknesses of the decolonizing impulse, I engage with the work of two prominent contemporary feminist theorists, Chandra Talpade Mohanty and Martha C. Nussbaum. Both Mohanty and Nussbaum aim to advance a model of cross-cultural feminism, though go about this in vastly different ways.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">gender; feminism; cultural difference; decolonizing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167468</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and Diet in Roman Britain</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Crane</field><field name="description">The thesis has considered what foods were available to the populations of the Late Iron Age and Roman Britain and the levels of nutrition possible. Evidence for (or the absence of) nutritional deficiency diseases was used to reach conclusions about the standard of health, and knowledge of modern nutritional food models enabled the author to assess the state of health of ancient individuals from a study of the foods to which they had access. To provide a benchmark for what can be ascertained about the Roman&#8217;s choices in food production, selection, cooking, consumption and storage, an examination was made of the sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum, where archaeological investigations have revealed aspects of daily life, trade, living and cooking arrangements, food utensils and human remains. A study of the literary sources determined the attitude of the Romans towards food; it was clear that Romans in the ancient world knew how to source their food, and were aware that, if not properly handled, some food could be detrimental to their health. Sites in Britain from the pre-Roman Iron Age were then considered in regards to food production, selection, cooking and storage, in order to be able to assess the situation after the Roman invasion. For the Roman period, different types of sites were considered: small and larger civilian centres and cemeteries, and military bases. To discover if there were regional differences in diet or nutrition, sites were selected from the North, Midlands, East Anglia, the South and South East and the South West. Also discussed was the role that external influences, features and facilities and occupation of each site had on developing the level of health of their inhabitants. It was found that the native and introduced populations throughout Britain during the Romano-British era did have access to a nutritionally sound food supply, and thus it was possible for them to maintain a healthy diet. Despite the introduction of new foods with the advent of the Romans, there was no discernable difference in the state of health and nutrition from the Iron Age to the Roman, with the exception of dental health, where there was a distinct deterioration as the result of sugar-rich foods being added to the diet. Those cases where the nutritional levels of the people fell below what might be considered conducive to good health were probably due to other factors: it was the physical features or facilities of a settlement (or lack of them) and the occupations and economic status of individuals that actually dictated standards of health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roman Britain, Diet, Nutrition, Food, Human Remains, Iron Age, Ancient Sources, Pompeii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170369</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Foundations for Practical &#8216;Totally Functional Programming&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Colin Kemp</field><field name="description">Interpretation is an implicit part of today&#8217;s programming; it has great power but is overused and has significant costs. For example, interpreters are typically significantly hard to understand and hard to reason about. The methodology of &#8220;Totally Functional Programming&#8221; (TFP) is a reasoned attempt to redress the problem of interpretation. It incorporates an awareness of the undesirability of interpretation with observations that definitions and a certain style of programming appear to offer alternatives to it. Application of TFP is expected to lead to a number of significant outcomes, theoretical as well as practical. Primary among these are novel programming languages to lessen or eliminate the use of interpretation in programming, leading to better-quality software. However, TFP contains a number of lacunae in its current formulation, which hinder development of these outcomes. Among others, formal semantics and type-systems for TFP languages are yet to be discovered, the means to reduce interpretation in programs is to be determined, and a detailed explication is needed of interpretation, definition, and the differences between the two. Most important of all however is the need to develop a complete understanding of the nature of interpretation. In this work, suitable type-systems for TFP languages are identified, and guidance given regarding the construction of appropriate formal semantics. Techniques, based around the &#8216;fold&#8217; operator, are identified and developed for modifying programs so as to reduce the amount of interpretation they contain. Interpretation as a means of language-extension is also investigated. Finally, the nature of interpretation is considered. Numerous hypotheses relating to it considered in detail. Combining the results of those analyses with discoveries from elsewhere in this work leads to the proposal that interpretation is not, in fact, symbol-based computation, but is in fact something more fundamental: computation that varies with input. We discuss in detail various implications of this characterisation, including its practical application. An often more-useful property, &#8216;inherent interpretiveness&#8217;, is also motivated and discussed in depth. Overall, our inquiries act to give conceptual and theoretical foundations for practical TFP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">interpretation</field><field name="subject">functional programming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:171001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using new computational tools to investigate the responses of cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to defoliation</field><field name="creator">Thornby, David</field><field name="description">Plant responses to damage, including defoliation, are complex. Plants have been shown to have a marked ability to compensate for damage, including by producing new or larger fruiting structures and by regrowing vegetative components following damage. While compensation for the loss of reproductive components has been widely investigated, compensation for the loss of vegetative components has been much less thoroughly studied. Similarly, biomass has been used as the index for studies of compensation in plants, while spatial aspects of compensation have been ignored. The spatial aspects of compensation include the topological position of lost and compensating structures, which is an indicator of resource allocation strategies in the plant following damage. Due to the complexity of interactions between structural and non-structural aspects of plant growth, particularly in response to damage, a computational approach to the problem is likely to provide advantages over more traditional approaches. In computational plant science, a simulation step may be added to the established scientific paradigm of hypothesis-experiment, so that it becomes hypothesis-simulation-experiment. The simulation step formalises what is currently known and allows for the generation of potentially more relevant and more testable hypotheses than ad hoc methods. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important crop in Australia, and a significant part of the agricultural economy. Cotton&#8217;s growth is constrained by a number of environmental factors, including the activities of pests. Cotton&#8217;s morphological responses to damage are particularly complex. Accordingly, cotton was chosen as a suitable model crop for investigating morphological responses to damage with computational tools. L-system models of cotton morphogenesis were produced by linking hypotheses about physiology, initially from the literature and later from data gathered during the research, with the structural outputs of physiology. The resulting simulations were used to generate morphological hypotheses that could be tested with real plant experiments. During the experiments, morphological data were gathered with a sonic digitiser, allowing comparison of the architectures of cotton plants at the level of each individual component. Because the measuring technique was non-destructive, plants could be measured many times, creating a set of data representing dynamic plant growth. Relationships from the data for several experiments on cotton's responses to defoliation of the main stem and branches of seedlings and older plants were used to adjust the initial model, rejecting some physiological hypotheses and confirming others. The result is a model that represents aspects of the interaction between cotton's carbon allocation, topology, and signalling behaviour following defoliation. Initial experiments found that apical development rates are not limited by photosynthate supply, at least at the levels of defoliation applied here. Unperturbed, obligate apical development was shown by subsequent versions of the model to be a significant contributor to cotton's ability to compensate for early season defoliation. Experiments on branch defoliation illustrate that while the vegetative branches respond in ways that are similar to those of the main stem, the sympodial branches behave in qualitatively different ways. Sympodial branch development was found to be significantly perturbed by the loss of the subtending main stem leaf, somewhat perturbed by the loss of significant leaf area within the branch, and very seriously perturbed by the removal of both the main stem leaf and branch leaves. The ability of a branch to produce mature bolls was likewise severely affected by defoliation, either of the branch leaves or of the subtending main stem leaf. However, no effect was noted where defoliation was applied to nearby branches or main stem leaves. This supports the theory that cotton branches are independent physiological units with regards to photosynthate. Branch independence interacts with cotton's propensity to produce many more fruiting structures than it can mature as a compensation mechanism for defoliation and subsequent fruit loss. This research demonstrates the utility of the hypothesis-simulation-experiment approach to biological investigation. This approach provides a way to use qualitative and quantitative physiological knowledge to produce readily tested morphological hypotheses for use in real plant experiments. The results of such experiments are demonstrated to be not only empirical evidence of a response, but evidence in support of or contradicting proposed physiological mechanisms for the response. Thus, the hypothesis-simulation-experiment approach as used in this thesis represents a method for generating and testing more meaningful hypotheses than are generally produced using ad hoc hypothesis generation techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270402 Plant Physiology</field><field name="subject">620107 Cotton</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177507</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive training, conflict resolution, and exercise: Effects on young adolescents' well being</field><field name="creator">Mark Taylor</field><field name="description">Abstract By 2020 the World Health Organisation has predicted that depression will be the largest cause of disease burden in the world (Ellen, 2002). This study investigated the effects of three interventions (Explanatory Style, Conflict Resolution, and Exercise) on the level of well-being of adolescents from the middle years of schooling. The research consisted of three studies. Study 1 involved the design of a Student Perception Questionnaire. The 28&#172;&#8211;item Student Perception Questionnaire was created to measure the outcomes of the three interventions and was trialled on 215 Middle School students. A Principal Components analysis with Varimax rotation was performed on the data retrieved from the respondents, and all items were retained on the questionnaire, although four factors did not show a .30 loading. Study 2, a Pilot Study, was conducted with three students to trial the interventions and measures in preparation for the final study. It included the collection of qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data was gained from interviews held with the students, parents, and teachers. Study 2 revealed that the interventions and the measures used to determine the effectiveness of the interventions would be suitable for Study 3. Study 3 was the full intervention that involved 25 students in an intervention group and six students in a no-intervention group. The 25 students were allocated to six groups that were engaged in a counterbalanced design study using the Explanatory Style, Conflict Resolution, and Exercise interventions. The group of six students was used as a comparison group. The results showed that students in the intervention group experienced a reduction of internalising behaviours such as withdrawal and depressive symptoms following all three interventions. The program as a whole was successful in reducing depressive symptoms and the interventions individually also significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The intervention group developed more optimistic thinking styles following the explanatory style intervention. Analysis of parent data revealed that parents of the intervention group were experiencing significant feelings of incompetence and guilt towards themselves as parents. In the members of the no-intervention group, having good social skills and a strong support network of friends and family were protective factors against depressive symptoms. The thesis showed that interventions can be used with adolescents that are effective in reducing depressive symptoms and do not have negative side effects, such as those associated with medications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Cognitive training, conflict resolution, exercise, adolescents, well being</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177781</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms in Caenorhabditis elegans</field><field name="creator">Qiang Cheng</field><field name="description">Phosphine, hydrogen phosphide (PH3), gas is a fumigant that is used worldwide to protect stored grain from infestation by insect pests. Despite a long history of phosphine use, little is known about either the mode of action of this compound or the mechanisms whereby insect pests have become resistant. To better understand phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms, a genetically well-characterised model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used in my PhD project. Three previously created phosphine resistant C. elegans mutants (pre-1, pre-7 and pre-33) developed from the wild type N2 strain were used in this study, though analysis of pre-33 was the primary focus. The three mutants were determined to be 2, 5 and 9 times more resistant toward phosphine than was the parental N2 strain by comparison of LC50 values. Molecular oxygen was shown to be an extremely effective synergist with phosphine as, under hyperoxic conditions, 100% mortality was observed in wild-type nematodes exposed to 0.1 mg/l phosphine, a non-lethal concentration in air. All three mutants were resistant to the synergistic effects of oxygen in proportion to their resistance to phosphine with one mutant, pre-33, showing complete resistance to this synergism. I take the proportionality of cross-resistance between phosphine and the synergistic effect of oxygen to imply that all three mutants circumvent a mechanism of phosphine toxicity that is directly coupled to oxygen metabolism. Compared with the wild-type strain, each of the three mutants has an extended average life expectancy of 12.5 to 25.3%. This is consistent with the proposed involvement of oxidative stress in both phosphine toxicity and ageing. Indeed, a correlation between phosphine resistance and resistance to other stressors (e.g. heavy metal, heat and UV) was also detected. On the other hand, no significant difference in methyl viologen sensitivity was found between pre-33 and N2 strains, suggesting that pre-33 mutant does not seem to provide resistance to phosphine via protection against oxidative damage. Additionally, to test for possible involvement of the DAF-2/DAF-16 signalling pathway in the phosphine response, the levels of phosphine sensitivity of mutants in this pathway were tested. Phosphine resistance levels were increased in daf-2 and age-1 mutants but decreased in daf-16 nematodes, which mirrors the longevity phenotypes of these mutants, suggesting some congruence in glucose signalling between the phosphine resistance and longevity traits. In contrast, no congruence is observed between phosphine resistance and oxidative metabolism as the clk-mutation, which disrupts oxidative metabolism does not cause phosphine resistance and neither do the phosphine resistant mutants cause the severe developmental delay of the clk-1 mutation. The phosphine induced time-dependent mortality was assessed in both N2 and pre-33 nematodes at two fixed phosphine concentrations (0.3 and 3.0 mg/l), allowing the determination of minimum exposure periods required for any mortality as well as the exposure time required to achieve 50% mortality. As a result, it was determined that 15 hours of exposure was needed for significant mortality in N2 and pre-33 strain when exposed to 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, respectively; whereas this period is 5 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l phosphine. The fact that the LT50 value for N2 at 0.3 mg/l phosphine is indistinguishable from that of pre-33 at 3.0 mg/l (24.6 and 24.5 respectively) suggests that 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine have the same toxic effects on N2 and pre-33 nematodes respectively. This result is consistent with the finding that pre-33 is ~9 fold more resistant to phosphine than is the N2 strain. Moreover, the LT50 was determined to be 8.4 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, which is only three times faster than pre-33 when exposed to the same level of phosphine. In contrast to the differential toxicity of phosphine between the N2 and pre-33 lines, the delay in reaching reproductive maturity caused by phosphine exposure is indistinguishable between WT and pre-33 nematodes. This indicates that the phosphine induced delay in maturation is independent of the toxic effects of phosphine. Since the inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been proposed as a mechanism of phosphine toxicity, the phosphine effects on cellular ATP metabolism, presented as ATP+ADP content and ATP/ADP ratio, were also assessed. Phosphine exposure (0.3 mg/l, 25 hours) led to a significant decrease in ATP+ADP levels as well as the ATP/ADP ratio in N2 nematodes. Similar results were also detected in pre-33 nematodes when exposed to 3.0 mg/l phosphine for 25 hours. These observations indicate that phosphine can interrupt cellular ATP metabolism, which is associated with phosphine induced mortality. Additionally, the fact that mutant pre-33 can maintain its ATP levels under phosphine exposure at 0.3 mg/l suggests it has a greater ability to maintain mitochondrial function than does the N2 strain. To better understand the mechanism of phosphine toxicity in the wild type N2 strain, gene expression profiling by DNA microarray analysis was employed. A significant overlap between phosphine and DAF-16 regulated genes was detected, supporting the previous finding that the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway can contribute to phosphine resistance. Phosphine exposure also strongly induced xenobiotic detoxification and stress responses, indicating nematodes are able to sense phosphine induced toxic effects and protect themselves by switching on native detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were also up-regulated by phosphine, possibly due to an increase in energy demand caused by increased xenobiotic detoxification activities. Consistent with the previous findings that phosphine delays median reproductive age and reduces fertility, expressions of a large number of genes involved in growth, embryonic development and reproduction were suppressed by phosphine. Moreover, the microarray results of seven genes whose expression levels were significantly altered by phosphine were validated using RT-PCR, confirming the robustness of the microarray results. The most direct way to determine the phosphine resistance mechanism in mutant pre-33 is to identify and characterise the mutation itself. Using a classic F1 test, the resistance mutation in pre-33 was determined to be incompletely recessive. Additionally, using three mapping strategies, the resistance mutation was mapped to Chromosome IV between 12,591,683 and 12,879,637 bp with 45 genes located in this small region. In an attempt to identify the resistance gene, the effect of suppressing each of 28 of the 45 genes in the interval was determined using a commercially available gene suppression library. It was observed that only knockdown of gene vha-7 resulted in a slight decrease in phosphine sensitivity (84.6%) compared to N2 (97.6%). However, this result does not clearly implicate vha-7 as the resistance gene in pre-33. The microarray results indicated that linoleate and arachidonate signalling pathways might be activated by phosphine. This was observed as induction of a phospholipase A2 gene that regulates the release of arachidonic acid from the C-2 position of membrane phospholipids, as well as several CYP genes predicted to catalyse the oxidation of linoleate and arachidonate. Therefore, phosphine effects on the linoleate and arachidonate dependent signalling pathways were assessed. It was found that, in the presence of phosphine, the pre-33 mutant has a greater ability to transform linoleate and arachidonate epoxides to diols than does N2. This activity may help pre-33 to better maintain mitochondrial function and, therefore, ATP metabolism than N2 during phosphine exposure. The microarray results also showed that phosphine exposure caused up-regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, indicating phosphine regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. As expected, a preliminary metabonomic analysis by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) into the effect of phosphine exposure on metabolism in N2 nematodes revealed significant alteration of the metabonomic profile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Longevity</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Metabonomics</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">ATP metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediated Electrochemistry of DMSO Reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus</field><field name="creator">Kuan-i Chen</field><field name="description">A series of macrocyclic FeIII/II and CoIII/II transition metal complexes has been selected and tested to serve as artificial mediators in redox potentiometry of proteins and also in catalytic cyclic voltammetry of redox active enzymes. The potentials of these mediators ranges approximately from +200 mV to -600 mV vs the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) at pH 7, which spans the range of most redox active proteins. These coordination complexes are mostly stable in both the oxidized and the reduced forms and show pH-independent electrochemistry within the range 6 &lt; pH &lt; 9. A significant advantage of these mediators is to exhibit very weak visible absorption maxima which enable proteins with low extinction coefficients to be studied by optical potentiometry without spectral interference from the mediators. These mediators have been applied to the catalytic electrochemistry of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase. DMSO reductase isolated from Rhodobacter capsulatus has been studied extensively in this work. It is an 82 kDa monomeric, soluble enzyme found in the periplasmic space of the organism where it is responsible for catalyzing the reduction of DMSO to dimethyl sulfide (DMS). DMSO is a rather inert and difficult to analyse compound, which appears in foods and beverages, such as wine, coffee, and tea. Enzyme based methods offer an effective way to detect DMSO in these samples. Rhodobacter capsulatus DMSO reductase contains only a single molybdenum cofactor which cycles between MoVI and MoIV during catalysis and provides a rare example of a Mo enzyme that has no other cofactors such as hemes, Fe-S clusters and flavins. Previous studies of direct (unmediated) electrocatalysis by DMSO reductase have shown only modest activity in comparison to that of other Mo enzymes. Mediated electrochemistry of DMSO reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus using low-potential macrocyclic complexes such as [Co(trans-diammac)]3+, [Co(cis-diammac)]3+, or [Co(AMMEsar)]3+ as a mediator has been studied. The normal transient CoIII/II voltammetric response of the complex is converted into a sigmoidal (steady state) waveform in the presence of both DMSO and DMSO reductase. A single set of enzymatic rate and equilibrium constants has been determined through digital simulation (DigiSim) of the cyclic voltammetry performed under conditions where the scan rate, DMSO concentration, DMSO reductase concentration and mediator concentration were varied systematically. This information provides new insight to the kinetics of the DMSO reductase catalytic mechanism that has never before been obtained from steady state or stopped flow kinetics studies. Of note is that lowering the thermodynamic driving force by sequentially raising the redox potential of the mediator ([Co(trans-diammac)]3+ to [Co(cis-diammac)]3+ to [Co(AMMESar)]3+) slows the enzyme-mediator electron transfer reaction in accord with Marcus theory. Finally, preparation of enantiomerically pure sulfoxides by an electrochemical enzymatic system utilizing DMSO reductase from Rhodobacter capsulatus has also been investigated. This method has been performed using the coordination complex [Co(trans-diammac)]3+ as an electron donor during bulk electrocatalysis. The results indicate that DMSO reductase from R. capsulatus prefers to catalyze the reduction of both R-MPTSO (methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide) and R-MPSO (methyl phenyl sulfoxide) over their S-enantiomers. These results have been rationalized on the basis of the published crystal structure of DMSO reductase (R. capsulatus) with DMSO bound at the active site.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">Enzyme</field><field name="subject">Dmso Reductase</field><field name="subject">Mediators</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178609</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Article Omission and Overuse: Syntax and Semantics of the English Article System in Interlanguage Grammar</field><field name="creator">Jun Matoba</field><field name="description">This thesis examines ungrammatical article omission, and overuse of the definite article 'the' in indefinite specific context by Japanese learners of English. This is an area of English grammar that has been considered a major problem for L2 learners (e.g. Ionin, Ko &amp; Wexler, 2004; R. Hawkins et al., 2005, 2006; Trenkic, 2007). The thesis extends the analysis of Japanese learners' interlanguage to the overuse of 'a' in indefinite specific mass contexts by these learners. A detailed analysis of DP structures in Japanese and English leads to the conclusion that Japanese learners, through their L1, are equipped with the linguistic features which map onto articles in English, even though Japanese lacks articles. The thesis examines the syntactic role of articles in rendering predicative nouns argumental (e.g. Chierchia, 1998; Longobardi, 1994) and explores the definiteness contrast marked by 'the' as opposed to 'a/&#248;' with singular count nouns and mass nouns (e.g. J. Hawkins, 1978) at the semantic level. Count/mass distinctions are also examined in detail (e.g. Doetjes, 1997; Jackendoff, 1992) because the 'a' versus '&#216;' contrast clearly relates this distinction. This thesis argues that, despite its lack of articles, the Japanese grammar expresses definiteness and count/mass distinctions through its classifier system. For example, different orderings of the constituents in a classifier phrase induce different interpretations as to definiteness (e.g. Kakegawa, 2004). Further, the thesis shows that some classifiers are incompatible with mass nouns, thus argue that in Japanese, as in English, nouns are associated with the features which underlie the count/mass distinction. Thus, the difficulty that Japanese learners display in mastering the grammar of articles in English is attributed to difficulties in the mapping between their syntactic and semantic underlying knowledge and the surface forms (e.g. Lardiere, 1998) rather than to the need to acquire new features or categories of syntactic or semantic knowledge as the Representational Deficit Hypothesis (R. Hawkins, 2005) claims. This proposal differs from the previous studies that assume that the relevant syntactic category is not present in the learners&#8217; L1 thus not acquirable in the L2 (R. Hawkins et al., 2005; Trenkic, 2007). It also differs from those that suggest that, even when the learners&#8217; L1 does not overtly realize these features (Ionin et al., 2004), the semantic features are available through universal grammar (UG). In order to examine how Japanese learners map syntactic and semantic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles in their English, data were collected via an oral production task and two types of grammaticality judgment tasks. An online judgment task was used to gather evidence for an intuitive type of knowledge of the constraints on article use, while an offline judgment task examined conscious metalinguistic knowledge of articles. Because L2 learners tend to construct and apply various metalinguistic rules as to the use of articles (Goto-Butler, 2002), the examination of both intuitive and conscious knowledge is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the development of the article system in interlanguage grammar. For the mapping of the syntactic knowledge of articles, the omission of articles by Japanese participants is investigated. The investigation focused on singular count nouns because the omission of articles with these nouns is ungrammatical in any context. It was observed that several of the Japanese participants indeed disallowed article omission for these nouns, suggesting that they had acquired the English system of mapping relevant syntactic knowledge onto the surface forms of articles. The thesis also explores the mapping of the semantic knowledge of articles by focusing on the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Previous studies have claimed that the overuse of 'the' is governed by the Article Choice Parameter (Ionin et al., 2004). The findings reported here confirm the tendency to overuse 'the' in indefinite specific (i.e. noteworthy (Ionin et al., 2004)) contexts. However, it was also observed that 'a' was judged acceptable in the same context. The offline grammaticality judgment task revealed that the choice of 'the' in this context may have been affected by metalinguistic knowledge. Thus, the findings are not in agreement with the hypothesis that a parameter governs the overuse of 'the' in indefinite specific contexts. Additionally, the thesis examines the overuse of 'a' in mass contexts. Though small in number, the participants who make inconsistent judgments for the same noun showed a tendency to accept the use of 'a' in specific contexts (i.e. de re specific) and reject it in non-specific contexts. It is argued that the feature [+specific] may be mapped onto 'a' in mass contexts in these learners&#8217; grammar. Based on these findings, the thesis explores how the syntactic module and the semantic module interact with each other in L2 grammar when mapping linguistic knowledge onto surface forms. The thesis also explores the effect of metalinguistic knowledge on L2 learners&#8217; grammaticality judgments in order to demonstrate a more comprehensive picture of article systems in interlanguage grammar.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English articles, definiteness, count/mass distinctions, interlanguage grammar, metalinguistic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178731</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of Botrytis cinerea infecting waxflower (Chamelaucium) flowers and potential elicitation of host defence in this pathosystem</field><field name="creator">Son-Quang Dinh</field><field name="description">Waxflower (Chamelaucium spp. and hybrids) is the singlemost important Australian export cut-flower. The major problem in waxflower trading is flower abscission after harvest. While several factors are involved, ethylene production resulting from preharvest infection with the fungus Botrytis cinerea is the most important cause. The general objectives of this study were to investigate the biology of Botrytis infecting waxflower flowers and potential elicitation of host defence against this pathogen. Effects of anti-ethylene and S-carvone treatments on Botrytis-induced flower abscission were also evaluated. Infection of flowers by Botrytis was studied on two waxflower cvs. Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen using light and electron microscopy. Conidial germination and protoappressorial formation occurred within 8 h post-inoculation (hpi). Infection of most floral organs, including petals, anthers and filaments, stigma, and hypanthium, was within 24 hpi. Infection cushions on stamen bases were formed at 36 hpi by saprophytic hyphae that originated from anthers. This infection route probably gives rise to the typical tan-coloured Botrytis symptoms that appear to radiate from this part of the flower. Subcuticular hyphae were present at very high density near stamen bases. They evidently resulted at multiple penetrations from single infection cushions. Flower abscission occurred at 72 hpi. At this time, floral tube tissues remained uninfected. This temporal pattern infers the possible transmission of a signal (e.g. ethylene) upon Botrytis infection (6&#8211;36 hpi) that intiates a defence response of shedding infected flowers (72 hpi). Susceptibility of waxflower before and after harvest to B. cinerea under various environmental conditions (laboratory, greenhouse, and field) was investigated. Flowers, either on plants or on cut stems showed similar susceptibility to B. cinerea and abscised under cool temperatures (~20 &#186;C) and high humidity (&gt;95% RH) conditions following infection. Compared to cv. Mullering Brook, cv. My Sweet Sixteen was somewhat more resistant to B. cinerea infection under field conditions. Constitutive and inducible antifungal compounds in waxflower flower tissues were screened in cvs. CWA Pink, Stephan&#8217;s Delight, Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen using thin layer chromatography bioassays with isolates of B. cinerea and Alternaria alternata (pathogenic) and Cladosporium cladosporioides (non-pathogenic). Common inhibition zone observed at Rf 0.28&#8211;0.38, 0.46&#8211;0.56 and 0.67&#8211;0.76 contained phenolic compounds. There were at least five (cv. Mullering Brook) and one (cv. My Sweet Sixteen) inducible antifungal phenolic compounds as judged by increases in inhibition area as a result of B. cinerea infection and methyl jasmonate treatment. The total areas of B. cinerea- and MeJA-induced inhibition zones were approximately 2.0- and 2.5-folds greater, respectively, than zones from control flowers. Preharvest sprays of three different known host plant defence elicitors, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), benzothiadiazole (BTH), and silicon (Si), were applied to waxflower cvs. Mullering Brook and My Sweet Sixteen plants. BTH or Si sprays generally had no significant effect on postharvest Botrytis severity on either cultivar. MeJA sprays did not reduce B. cinerea on cv. Mullering Brook. MeJA slightly suppressed B. cinerea on cv. My Sweet Sixteen at 500 and 750 &#181;M. Overall, field applications of these host plant defence elicitor chemicals as spray treatments had little effect on vase life, water uptake and relative fresh weight of the cut sprigs. Moreover, they did not appreciably suppress B. cinerea or associated postharvest floral abscission. The efficacy of combined elicitor treatments and combined pre- and postharvest MeJA treatments were assessed. Preharvest foliar applications of MeJA (1000 &#181;M; 2 or 4 times), MeJA (1000 &#181;M) combined with BTH (150 mg/L), and MeJA combined with Si (1500 mg SiO2/L) generally did not suppress postharvest B. cinerea development and flower abscission from harvested sprigs. A pre- plus post-harvest 1000 &#181;M MeJA spray treatment consistently but only slightly suppressed B. cinerea infection on flowers from both pot- and field-grown plants. Pre- and post-harvest MeJA treatments reduced B. cinerea development, but increased flower abscission. Combined MeJA and anti-ethylene treatments were then screened for potential to suppress B. cinerea while preventing flower abscission. However, the combined MeJA and 1-MCP treatment reduced neither Botrytis disease nor flower abscission on sprigs from pot- and field-grown plants. The combined MeJA and STS treatment reduced disease severity for up to 6 days on sprigs harvested from pot-grown plants but tended to increase Botrytis severity on sprigs from field-grown plants 6 days after inoculation. Antifungal effects of the essential oil S-carvone against B. cinerea germination and mycelial growth were demonstrated in vitro. Inhibition increased with increasing S-carvone concentrations from 0.64 mM to 5.08 mM. However, in planta, S-carvone concentrations in this range did not affect either Botrytis disease levels or flower abscission on cut waxflower flowers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anti-ethylene</field><field name="subject">Antifungal</field><field name="subject">Benzothiadiazole</field><field name="subject">Botrytis cinerea</field><field name="subject">Chamelaucium</field><field name="subject">Electron Microscopy</field><field name="subject">grey mould</field><field name="subject">Methyl Jasmonate</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">S-carvone</field><field name="subject">Waxflower</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179049</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Sex Specific Cell Cycle Regulation in Fetal Germ Cells</field><field name="creator">Cassy Spiller</field><field name="description">During development, somatic cell cues direct sex-specific differentiation of germ cells that is characterised by two distinct cell cycle states. At 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) in a testis, XY germ cells stop proliferating and enter G1/G0 arrest. In the ovary, XX germ cells bypass G1/G0 arrest and instead enter the first phase of meiosis I from 13.5 dpc. Whilst it is hypothesised that errors in cell cycle control during development precede the formation of testicular germ cell tumours, the mechanism of cell cycle control at this time has not been thoroughly investigated. This project therefore sought to explore the mechanism of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest using several approaches. Although cell cycle regulation for somatic cells is well established, we know very little regarding germ cell control of this process. Therefore my first aim was to profile this machinery at the transcript level using a cell cycle cDNA array. Purified populations of germ cells were isolated both before and after sex differentiation and expression of 112 cell cycle related genes was assessed. From this study a comprehensive network governing apoptosis and calcium signalling that was common to both XX and XY germ cells was observed. Importantly, the retinoblastoma family and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was implicated in the regulation of G1/G0 arrest in XY germ cells. Lastly, XX germ cells displayed a down-regulation of genes involved in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle consistent with their progression past G1 phase. This study has provided a detailed analysis of cell cycle gene expression during fetal germ cell development and identified candidate factors for future investigation in order to understand cases of aberrant cell cycle control in these specialised cells. In order to investigate several candidate genes identified within the cell cycle array, I next sought to generate a germ cell-specific Cre recombinase mouse model for use in conditional knockout studies. As current Cre lines lack specificity or appropriate temporal expression, we used the germ cell-specific regions of the fragilis promoter to drive Cre expression during germ cell specification. Eleven founder lines were generated using this construct and four were analysed using a reporter line. Although we have not achieved germ cell expression from these lines to date, analysis continues in order to identify an invaluable new tool for germ cell research. Following the implication of the retinoblastoma family in XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest, I next investigated the role of RB in these cells using the Rb null mutant. RB is a known cell cycle suppressor that controls this process in many cell types and, subsequently, mice homozygous for the Rb deletion die in utero at 14.5 dpc. Using this model we analysed developing gonads from 14.5 &#8211; 16.5 dpc using ex vivo culture techniques. At 14.5 dpc when wild type germ cells have arrested, proliferating germ cells were detected in the absence of Rb using proliferation marker Ki67. This proliferation was accompanied by a slight increase in germ cell number at 14.5 dpc, however, two days later at 16.5 dpc germ cell numbers were slightly decreased in the Rb-/- testes. During this time we could also detect increased expression of other RB family members p107 and p130, suggesting that these factors may compensate for the loss of Rb in the germ line. This investigation has implicated RB in the regulation of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest and will form the basis for future work aimed at understanding the initiation of this cell cycle state. In addition to RB, a lesser-known transcription factor was also investigated in the initiation and maintenance of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest. The high mobility group box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) suppresses proliferation and promotes differentiation in various cell types and was recently identified within the XY germ cells at the appropriate time of sex differentiation. In my analysis two Hbp1 transcripts were identified within the XY germ cells that display different sub-cellular localisations in vitro. Next, Hbp1-LacZ reporter lines were generated to aid in understanding the germ cell-specific regulation of these transcripts and lastly, I analysed the genetrap mutation for Hbp1. Surprisingly, this model revealed no aberrations to germ cell-cell cycle control during development. In summary, I have performed the first comprehensive study of the cell cycle machinery utilised by germ cells as they undergo the first stages of sex differentiation. Using loss-of-function models I was able to implicate the cell cycle regulator RB specifically in XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest and, conversely, demonstrate that the transcription factor HBP1 is not required for this process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetal germ cell</field><field name="subject">cell cycle regulation</field><field name="subject">gonad</field><field name="subject">mitotic arrest</field><field name="subject">meiosis</field><field name="subject">testis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180111</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; Employee Knowledge Sharing on Knowledge Management Systems: Normative and Social Exchange Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Scott Krebs</field><field name="description">Capturing and sharing individual and organisational knowledge is vital for organisational functioning. Knowledge management systems (KMS) are information technology systems which enable employees to electronically capture and distribute knowledge across the organisation. Because knowledge sharing is often a discretionary behaviour requiring time and energy on behalf of employees, the success of KMS largely relies on their motivation and willingness to share. KMS implemented within organisations have been largely ineffective with failure rates of 80% documented in the knowledge management literature. There is a need for further understanding of the barriers and facilitators for employee contributions to KMS. In particular, there is a dearth of empirical research examining the role of social and organisational factors in knowledge sharing on KMS. To this end, a programme of research was developed which utilised normative and social exchange perspectives to explain employee knowledge sharing on KMS. A combination of research methodologies were employed across five field-based studies. The aim of Study 1 was to identify the determinants of knowledge sharing on KMS. In Study 1, qualitative data were collected through 16 in-depth interviews with employees from a medium-sized private sector organisation. While several barriers and facilitators were identified, the most prevalent themes to emerge from the content analysis were perceived benefits and management support, highlighting the central role of social exchange and normative processes in explaining employee knowledge sharing on KMS. The results of Study 1 were used in conjunction with previous research to design the subsequent quantitative studies. Study 2 examined the mediating role of perceived benefits in the management support &#8211; knowledge sharing intentions relationship. It used a cross-sectional survey design and sampled 41 employees from a large private sector organisation. Three main findings emerged. First, management support was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Second, perceived benefits were positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Third, perceived individual benefits mediated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing intentions. Study 3 examined the moderating role of perceived organisational support (POS) in the management support &#8211; knowledge sharing intentions relationship. Study 2 and 3 were both quantitative studies taken from the same organisational setting but with different user groups. In Study 2, the users directly contributed their knowledge onto the system. In Study 3 (N = 45), the users shared their knowledge through an intermediary person. Study 3 further extended Study 2 by investigating knowledge sharing behaviour (N = 27) in addition to knowledge sharing intentions. Study 3 had three key findings. First, consistent with Study 2, management support was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Second, POS was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions and knowledge sharing behaviour. Third, POS moderated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing behaviour. Study 4 replicated and extended the findings of the previous studies in a different organisational setting. Two separate studies were conducted in a medium-sized public sector organisation. In Study 4a (N = 295) data were collected at a single point in time. Study 4b (N = 246) extended the previous quantitative studies by examining two forms of management support for the KMS as well as collecting self-reported behavioural data (N= 130) at a second time period. Overall, the findings of these studies provided mixed support for the predictions. First, system-related management support, organisational identification, perceived individual benefit and perceived organisational benefit were directly related to employee knowledge sharing on KMS. However, contrary to prediction, POS was not found to be directly related to employee knowledge sharing across the two studies. Second, organisational identification was found to moderate the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing in Study 4a but not 4b. Third, POS moderated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing in Study 4b, however, no such relationship was found in Study 4a. Finally, across the two studies, both perceived individual and organisational benefit were found to uniquely mediate the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing intentions. On the basis of the findings of the research programme, several conclusions were made. First, system-related support from management is an important determinant of employee knowledge sharing on KMS. Second, employees&#8217; perception of the benefits derived from knowledge sharing has an important influence on their contributions to KMS. Third, the extent to which employees identify with the organisation influences their decision to share knowledge on KMS. Fourth, the extent to which employees perceive support from the organisation influences their decision to share knowledge on KMS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Sharing, Social Exchange, Norms, Knowledge Management Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180142</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the emergence, diffusion and continuance of intercountry adoption from South Korea to Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Patricia Fronek</field><field name="description">The adoption of Korean children has played a significant role in the practice of intercountry adoption in Australia since the 1970s and represents the majority of overseas born children adopted into Australia. Its influence on policy and practice is explored in this thesis through the Queensland experience. From its outset the adoption of children from overseas has been characterised by polarised perspectives and vested interests. Actor Network Theory, the theoretical lens through which this phenomenon is viewed, allows for the exploration of controversies and multiple perspectives that have featured in over thirty years of Korean intercountry adoption practice in Australia. This thesis aims to identify which actor networks were influential in the emergence, diffusion and continuation of Korean intercountry adoption; and to explore the translations, an important concept in Actor Network Theory, and the tactics used by these networks to spread particular discourse to meet network goals. The methodology is qualitative and approaches Korean intercountry adoption as a case study. The data corpus, collected from 2004 to 2007 comprised text and interviews. Text included Queensland government archival records; submissions provided to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services Overseas Adoption in Australia 2005 and public hearing transcripts; parliamentary documents; media reports; computer-mediated communications such as internet sources and email discussion groups. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders from interest groups and organisations with administrative roles in intercountry adoption practice in Australia. Korean intercountry adoption has proved influential in developing expectations concerning how intercountry adoption should be practised in Australia. Three actor networks, proponent, opponent and nonpartisan were identified during the diffusion and continuance periods. Actor Network Theory helped understand how the proponent network became dominant in the Australian context. A number of highly effective tactics have been used to expand and increase the influence of the proponent network through translations. However, a number of threats to continuation such as the growth of the opponent network and the promotion of Korean domestic adoption have emerged. Actors have responded to these threats in a number of ways. Detours have been proposed by proponent actors to help them reach their goals though these may bring unintended consequences. An Actor Network Theory perspective reveals the important role of the Internet; helps understand how controversies are created and perpetuated; how intercountry adoption has become politicised in Australia; and highlights the risks to child centred and knowledge based practice that politicisation brings. The significance of this study lies in the insights provided by exploring power interrelationships between actor networks and how these shape particular phenomenon, in this case, Korean intercountry adoption. Intercountry adoption in Australia is poorly understood at a macro level as are the controversies surrounding it. Its practice has been heavily influenced by the interests of the dominant network with scant attention to research in the local context. Actor Network Theory that allows for the inclusion of human and nonhuman actors such as the Internet has proven useful for developing contemporary understandings of such a complex, global phenomenon. These understandings provide opportunities for individuals, groups and governments to address controversy in ways than do not contribute to its perpetuation and to refocus their attentions on the factors that contribute to the relinquishment of children in the first instance. This thesis highlights how politically driven agendas that serve the interests of one network can marginalise voices that bring more complex understandings to the intercountry adoption phenomenon. An Actor Network Theory analysis exposes the lack of investment by governments, organisations and individuals in community programs and services that address the causes of child relinquishment and empower Korean families and communities to seek their own solutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intercountry Adoption</field><field name="subject">South Korea</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Actor Network Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180158</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSUMER EVALUATIONS OF SPONSOR BRAND ASSOCIATIONS</field><field name="creator">Pi-Hsuan Monica Chien</field><field name="description">Corporate sponsorships have received increased attention from brand managers and academics in recent years. While researchers agree that sponsorship aids in generating favourable images for the sponsor, both at the corporate and brand levels, a lack of theory-guided models has prevented investigation into more complex phenomena. Current understanding of sponsorship effects is largely confined to the single sponsorship context with dominant emphasis on sponsorship awareness. The challenge surrounding sponsorship image measurement is only heightened by the increase in sponsorship activities. A growing number of brands are becoming associated with multiple events or entities. The purpose of the present research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie consumer processing of a brand&#8217;s sponsorship portfolio to affect inferences about sponsor brand associations, and in particular brand personality, brand meaning and brand attitude. The present research consolidates a range of conceptual and theory-guided models used by previous researchers, and adds to sponsorship literature by outlining how an accessibility based model can be applied to explain the cognitive processes involved when consumers encounter a brand&#8217;s sponsorships sequentially. In the context of a sponsorship portfolio, the associative network memory theory, congruence theory, and accessibility-diagnosticity theory are considered collectively and integrated into a conceptual framework to guide the development of hypotheses. The general theory proposed here is that accessibility of a sponsorship episode determines whether it will be used in subsequent information processing and percolate through to sponsor evaluations. A three-experiment research program is developed to explore the dynamics behind the portfolio effects. Pretests are conducted to identify brands and sponsorship properties that conform to the experimental manipulations but also to control for extraneous variables. Experiment 1 is designed to investigate the impact of perceived sponsorship portfolio fit on sponsor brand associations, and to determine how consumers assess portfolio fit. The experiment employs a 2 (sponsorship category relatedness: related vs. unrelated) x 2 (event personality fit: high fit vs. low fit) x 2 (sponsor product category: apparel vs. watch) between-subjects factorial design. Results point to sponsorship category relatedness as an important reference point in the evaluation of portfolio fit because it pulls sponsorships together when event personality fit is low, showing the predominance of category-based mode of processing. The role of event personality fit emerges when sponsorships lack categorical relatedness, leading to piecemeal-mode processing. Its influence of event personality fit is largely mute when sponsorships are categorically related, possibly because the individual event concepts are overwhelmed by a superordinate categorical imagery. Experiment 2 is designed to (1) allow replication of the portfolio effects with an additional sponsor product and different sets of sponsorship portfolios, and (2) investigate how individuals respond to a sponsorship portfolio which contains sponsorship properties with conflicting categories and personalities. Specifically, Experiment 2 aims to determine whether one sponsorship &#8220;frames&#8221; the processing of another sponsorship in a portfolio, and if so, determines the direction of framing. The experiment employs a 2 (sponsorship presentation sequence: sports first vs. cause first) x 2 (visual cues: present vs. absent) x 3 (sponsor product replicates: apparel vs. watch vs. juice) mixed factorial design. Two key findings emerge from this experiment. First, inferences about the sponsor brands&#8217; personalities are made in an additive fashion by augmenting event personalities, conforming to the &#8220;entitativity&#8221; principle. Second, when a sports sponsorship (rather than a cause sponsorship) is presented first in a portfolio, conceptual fluency is enhanced. This is because the sequence of processing is consistent with the way that people naturally think, thus leading to greater processing fluency. Experiment 3 is developed to further test the sponsorship framing effect and to explore the role of articulation in forging a relationship for ostensibly unrelated sponsorships. The experiment uses a 2 (sponsorship frame: sports frame vs. cause frame) x 2 (articulation: present vs. absent) between-subjects factorial design, plus a replicate and two control groups. Results replicate the findings of previous experiment where inferences for the sponsor brand personality are determined in an additive fashion. The findings also provide insights into when and whether using articulation in sponsorship communications can be beneficial. While articulating the relationship between sponsorships increases the perceived brand meaning consistency and clarity, a boomerang effect on brand attitude is observed, possibly because the commercially oriented content attributes a sales-oriented motive to the sponsor, which in turn, leads to a less favourable brand attitude. Theoretically, this research adds to current understanding of consumer-focused sponsorship processing by moving beyond simple pairing of sponsor and event, to consider the relationship between sponsorship properties. Through the integration of accessibility-diagnosticity theory, this research demonstrates that the way sponsorships influence brand evaluations is likely to be more complex than suggested by the existing literature and contributes to the development of methods to measure image transfer process. Practically, this research assists managers who are interested in the formulation of sponsorship policy and strategic design of sponsorship portfolios. The conceptual model developed in this thesis offers useful guidelines in providing input into the decision-making process when considering whether sponsorships could be used as brand building tools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship, brand associations, marketing, consumer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180166</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Board in Firm Strategy: A Strategy as Practice View</field><field name="creator">Kevin Hendry</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate how boards of directors strategize, how they manage strategy and how context affects this role. The significance of this research is underscored by three points. First, while there is an extensive body of literature on the board&#8217;s role in strategy, our understanding of how boards address this role, particularly how boards interact with management on strategy, is limited. Second, there is an implicit, albeit largely unproven, assumption in the literature that board involvement in strategy leads to more effective organizational performance. Third, there is a significant concern, especially from a practitioner perspective, that boards are overly focused on aspects of compliance at the expense of strategy and hence, underemphasize their role in driving firm performance. I begin with a review of the relevant literature on the strategy role of boards, using this literature to inform and reframe the broad research question that initiated this thesis &#8211; how do boards of directors contribute to strategy? In synthesizing this literature, I argue that it has not adequately addressed actual board behaviour in strategy and the impact of context on this behaviour. With this argument in mind, I frame board involvement in strategy from a Strategy as Practice perspective. I define board level strategizing as the situated (context dependent), socially accomplished flow of activities that characterizes how boards manage strategy, alternatively expressed as how boards &#8216;do&#8217; strategy. I use this Strategy as Practice perspective to reframe and refine the original research question. I follow the literature review with a discussion of the philosophical and methodological basis for this thesis, outlining an exploratory research program focused primarily on qualitative inquiry and supported by quantitative inquiry. In the qualitative stage I follow an inductive process that involves the pragmatic use of Grounded Theory Method. My specific objective is to develop a rich understanding of the practices that characterize board level strategizing and how these practices are affected by contextual aspects of the firm&#8217;s internal and external environments. I draw on pre-existing ideas from the Strategy as Practice literature on corporate level strategizing practices &#8211; Procedural and Interactive Strategizing &#8211; and use these as the starting point for an investigation into the strategizing practices of boards of directors. This stage involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with all directors and senior managers (47 in total) in six purposively chosen organizations. It also involves in-depth interviews with another 17 senior managers in 15 different organizations. viii In the quantitative stage I rely on survey research. My specific objectives are to both simplify and enhance the understanding of board level strategizing developed in the qualitative stage. In simplifying understanding I aim to develop concise constructs that adequately capture board level strategizing; in enhancing understanding I aim to develop multiple item indicators for each construct that address its complexity. This stage involves three phases: a pre-test, a pilot survey in one Australian state and a national survey. In operationalizing constructs, I integrate key points from the literature with the detailed description of board level strategizing that emerges from the qualitative stage. Data analysis involves the use of Exploratory Factor Analysis in the Pilot study and Confirmatory Factor Analysis in the National study. The qualitative findings indicate that boards engage in a context specific balance between Procedural and Interactive Strategizing. The former involves an administrative, formalized and hierarchical focus while the latter involves an interpretative and reciprocal focus, one that emphasizes face-to-face interaction between directors and management. While Procedural Strategizing involves the board responding to management&#8217;s interpretation of strategy, Interactive Strategizing involves each group arguing for their own interpretations of strategy before reaching collective agreement based on these interpretations. The qualitative findings also indicate that Procedural and Interactive Strategizing are opposite but complementary practices and that the balance between these practices is affected by the interaction between three contextual aspects: (1) the strategic stance of the board; (2) board power relative to management; and (3) the perceived legitimacy of each practice on the part of the organizational actors involved. In elaborating this balance between Procedural and Interactive Strategizing I develop a new theoretical perspective to describe board involvement in strategy. The quantitative findings identify the specific micro-activities that comprise Procedural and Interactive Strategizing. I argue that this thesis makes three significant and interrelated contributions to knowledge. First, it develops a board specific strategizing framework and language, one that advances current concepts in the literature. Second, it represents the initial steps in developing an explanatory theory of board strategizing, one that focuses on the underlying, context specific, practices that constitute boards &#8216;doing&#8217; strategy. Third, it develops a preliminary scale to measure this strategizing behaviour. Finally, I discuss the implications of this thesis for further research and for practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Strategy, boards, directors, governance, strategizing, practice, behaviour, context.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183689</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Helicoverpa armigera to agricultural environments diversified through companion planting.</field><field name="creator">Renee Herde</field><field name="description">This study investigated the potential of companion planting as a strategy to aid in the management of Helicoverpa armigera in tomato and capsicum cropping systems. The investigaitons showed that a companion planting type system is unlikely to confer any benefits to the management of H. armigera in these crops. The project has contributed to the understanding of H. armigera host selection and how the pest responds to a diversified environment. Companion planting and vegetational diversity are strategies for reducing pest incidence on crops. Many theories have been devised to explain how introducing more than one plant species to a cropping space may reduce the incidence of a pest. Five ecological theories formed the basis of experiments in this study: The resource concentration hypothesis - Herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands (Root, 1973). Associational resistance/Plant apparency - Crop plants grown as monocultures are more apparent to herbivorous insects than plants in diverse natural systems (Tahvanainen and Root, 1972). Trap cropping &#8211; the use of plants within a cropping area to attract oviposition away from the main crop (Banks and Ekbom, 1999). The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host seleciton (Cunningham et al., 1998a). The natural enemies hypothesis - generalist and specialist natural enemies are expected to be more abundant in diverse rather than simple systems (Root, 1973) A tall variety of sorghum (the forage variety Chopper) was tested for its ability to disrupt host location. Sorghum was planted around plots of tomatoes to act as a screen to disrupt visual cues for host location by Helicoverpa spp. No difference was found in egg numbers on tomatoes with or without sorghum companions. However, significantly higher numbers of Helicoverpa spp. larvae were found in the sorghum at flowering than in the tomatoes. This suggested the sorghum was acting as a trap crop, diverting oviposition away from the tomato crop. However, due to a short period of flowering and therefore peak attractiveness to H. armigera, sorghum was not considered to be a suitable companion plant for inclusion in commercial tomato production systems. A host preference study was conducted to determine the preferences of H. armigera for crop plants and possible companions in the hope of finding a suitable trap crop species. Tomatoes were shown to be a highly preferred plant making it difficult to find a compatible trap crop species that would be more attractive than the main crop. However, capsicums were less prefered and therefore more suitable for this type of experimentation. Marigolds were also found to be a highly preferred plant and formed the basis for further investigations into trap cropping systems. Field experiments were conducted in successive years in two geographical locations to assess the suitability of marigolds as a trap crop for capsicums in a field situation. However, in both years H. armigera incidence was extremely and unusually low leading to inconclusive results. A glasshouse experiment was performed to assess if the ratio of capsicum plants to marigolds plants had an effect on which species H. armigera would choose for oviposition. It was found that as more capsicum plants were introduced, moths became less likely to oviposit on the supposedly more preferred marigold plant. The diminishing attractiveness of a more preferred host in the presence of other hosts is a new observation of H. armigera behaviour. This result suggests that marigolds would be unlikely to be a successful trap crop in a field situation. The ability of H. armigera to learn in regard to host selection and the influence of this on host selection in the field was investigated. No evidence of learning was found. This was the first study investigating the effect of learning in a field situation; previously the behaviour had only been investigated in a laboratory situation (Cunningham, et al. 1998a). The ability of the Australian assassin bug, Pristhesancus plagipennis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) to predate H. armigera larvae on capsicum plants was investigated. This predator has been sucessfully been used for H. armigera management in cotton (Grundy, 2000b), but had not been investigated in horticultural crops. Significant reductions in larvae were achieved in treatments where assassin bugs were introduced. This predator warrants further investigation for inclusion in commercial integrated pest managment programs for capsicums. Pest repellent plants were also considered. Previous to this study, very little research work had been conducted on repellent plants for H. armigera. The herbs investigated were catnip (Nepta cataria), tansy (Tanacetum vulgare), basil (Ocium basilicum) and coriander (Coriander sativum). An olfactometer system was designed and built to test H. armigera moths&#8217; responses to odours from the herbs. Glasshouse experiments were also conducted. No repellent activity was recorded with any of the herbs tested. The results of this study support the theory that Helicoverpa spp. employ a strategy of passive host selection as suggested by Firempong (1986). This means that all available plants in an area may be oviposited on with successful ovipostion and larval development leading to the future utilisation of a species as a host plant. The implication of this finding is that in-field trap cropping is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing H. armigera oviposition in tomato or capsicum production systems in Australia. In cotton crops in Australia, trap cropping is used as part of an area wide management strategy and aims to reduce the total Helicoverpa spp. population of a region. Such a strategy may also be successful in horticultural crops but only with the full participation of the growers of all crops that are attractive to H. armigera in a horticultural growing region. Due to the diverse nature of horticultural production this may be a difficult task.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera, companion planting, trap cropping, learning, marigold, host selection, repellent plants, Pristhesancus plagipennis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183732</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Folio of Compositions and Critical Commentary</field><field name="creator">Daniel Salecich</field><field name="description">Through an innate desire to present works with an underlying musical philosophy and a mastery of technical phenomena, this folio of compositions and critical commentary is an attempt to present a progressive collection of my original music with an accompanying philosophical and analytical examination.

The folio demonstrates a willingness to utilise a wealth of sources, extramusical content, and to experiment and collaborate on project outcomes.

The specific research focus is on the policy strategy Queensland State Education&#8211;2010 (QSE-2010) developed by the Queensland State government and released in 2000. The thesis adopts a governmentality perspective to develop a policy case study focusing on the formulation of QSE-2010 through to its implementation as set out in the Queensland Government&#8217;s 2002 White Paper, Education and Training Reforms for the Future. The research demonstrates how one State education system in Australia was transformed as a result of the spread of global risk rationalities originating in comparative studies conducted by the OECD. The study begins by examining how QSE-2010 was discursively positioned within a policy environment characterised by the transformation of social and economic relations into deterritorialised flows and globally connected networks of the global knowledge economy. Queensland&#8217;s future prosperity in this emerging context was articulated as unpredictable and uncertain. The policy discourse of QSE-2010 thus presented the global as a novel problem space requiring intervention by responsible government. This analysis identifies the key policy role of knowledge producing practices such as statistical studies, international comparisons and performance benchmarking in transforming global uncertainty into a form that was conducive to governmental programming in education. In the case of education in Queensland, this involved mobilising specific calculative technologies to transform global economic uncertainty into knowable and calculable educational risk. This was expressed in QSE-2010s principal performance target that required 88 percent of students to complete Year 12 by 2010. This study further traces how Education Queensland&#8217;s aspirations to manage globalisation risks were translated into practical programs of social and educational governance. It proposes that the concept of social capital was critical for providing a means of attributing economic value to certain patterns of social interaction within families and between families and communities. Once authorities were able to link particular patterns of sociability to increased levels of educational attainment, it became possible to problematise the social capital of some families as a potential source of risk for educational disengagement of students. Here, the social capital believed to characterise the professional, globally networked middle class family emerged as a model for education authorities in Queensland for re-configuring the social capital of disadvantaged families. Social capital thus became instrumental in Education Queensland&#8217;s strategy to govern the relationships between schools and their communities, especially relationships between the home and school. Understanding of the problem of educational disengagement afforded by social capital led to attempts to impose particular forms of social capital on Queensland families. This was achieved by mandating the involvement of parents and students in the process of Senior Education and Training Plans. These plans were formally negotiated education and training pathways that students would follow for the completion of the senior phase of learning and the award of the Queensland Certificate of Education. The study argues that governmental technologies such as social capital are critical determinants of the limits and possibilities for social justice outcomes in education policy because they function to constitute both the problems of government and the scope of legitimate policy intervention. It further argues that these technologies have been instrumental in sustaining neoliberal policy solutions in Queensland education because they render invisible socio-economic explanations for educational disadvantage and structured inequalities in education. The study concludes by exploring alternative policy configurations that are made intelligible by alternative ways of representing the social and economic context of schooling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education policy, globalisation, governmentality, risk, subjectivity, social investment, social capital, social inequality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184043</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl without hands: extract from the manuscript of a novel. The Maiden without hands: from folktale and fairy ale to contemporary novel</field><field name="creator">Melissa Ashley</field><field name="description">The Girl without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel By Melissa Jane Ashley Abstract The major component of the thesis is an extract from the manuscript, The Girl without Hands, a novelised interpretation of the folktale and fairy tale, The Maiden without Hands. The novel is composed of three books, with point of view structured as shifting third person; most of the story is narrated by the central character, Marina Fischer. The manuscript deploys a variety of fairy tale and folktale related literary techniques, including magic realism, intertextuality, framing, and fantasy. Events span a period of eight years, the action set in rural and urban parts of Queensland and Victoria. On an unsupervised picnic with friends, fourteen year old Marina Fischer&#8217;s twin sister Sonia suffers a fatal head injury. Grief-stricken and self-blaming, Marina reacts to the trauma by losing all feeling and movement in her hands. Six months following the accident, Marina seems on the verge of recovery; she attends regular therapy and is protected by her loyal friends, siblings Amelia and Sammy Jones. However, the patina of stability begins to crack when Marina is confronted at the year ten formal by Sonia&#8217;s former associates, Kylie Bates and Jody Cutter, also present at her death. Distraught and upset, Marina flees the dance in Jody&#8217;s older brother&#8217;s car. Seven years later Marina meets Matt Soverign, a gifted hypnotist, who tries to help her regain movement in her hands. They sleep together and Marina unexpectedly falls pregnant. Their son Tristram is born while Matt attends an interstate conference. Thinking a child would help her hands to heal, Marina becomes depressed when she continues to suffer from paralysis. She begins to dwell on memories of her sexual assault the night of the school dance, slowly losing touch with reality. But a phone call from her estranged friend, Amelia Jones, shakes Marina out of her stasis. Her close mate Sammy, who now lives in Melbourne, has fallen dangerously ill. With her relationship in pieces, Marina purchases train tickets for herself and Tristram and embarks upon a spontaneous&#8212;though much delayed&#8212;journey to reconcile the past. The critical component of the thesis is an essay entitled &#8220;The Maiden without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel&#8221;. Chapter one, &#8220;The Tale is Not Beautiful if Nothing is Added to It,&#8221; is a literary survey of cross-cultural folktale and fairy tale variants of the 1200 year old narrative, The Maiden without Hands. I explore academic debate regarding the literary fairy tale&#8217;s indebtedness to the oral folktale, discussing Susan Stewart&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;distressed text&#8217; and Lewis Seifert&#8217;s theory of &#8216;nostalgic recuperation.&#8217; Chapter two, &#8220;Then the Devil Will Take Me Away,&#8221; undertakes a close reading of the Grimm Brothers&#8217; influential but controversial 1857 re-write of The Maiden without Hands narrative. I suggest that Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s suppression of the &#8216;unnatural father&#8217; episode, found in the traditional folktale, aided the story&#8217;s survival in and beyond the nineteenth century, when such themes became taboo. I explore how the Grimms&#8217; aesthetic revisions of folk material&#8212;to make them appeal to a middle class audience, including children&#8212;helped proliferate stereotyped representations of females and femininity in classic fairy tales. These depictions, I argue, often cause ambivalence in contemporary female readers, however they also instigate creative revisionary projects (such as my own), which seek to explore the residual energy contained in fairy tale texts, while at the same time destabilising their sexual stereotyping. In the last chapter, &#8220;The Only Thing She Doesn&#8217;t Have is Arms,&#8221; I discuss how extensive research into the many incarnations of The Maiden without Hands altered my understanding of the narrative&#8217;s symbols, tropes and metaphors, leading to significant changes to the plot of my novel. Citing examples from my text, The Girl without Hands, and comparing and contrasting them with excerpts from variants of the folktale and fairy tale, I analyse my creative interpretation of The Maiden without Hands&#8217; major themes: loss and lack; sexual assault and violation; creativity and writing; and, finally, healing and wholeness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Fairy tale</field><field name="subject">Folktale</field><field name="subject">The Girl without Hands</field><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Novel</field><field name="subject">Conversion Disorder</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of higher education for knowledge on and for Africa: A historical critique</field><field name="creator">Adelino Chissale</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the ways in which higher education in Africa has been construing its mission for Africa&#8217;s development and how such constructions are shaped by particular global regimes of knowledge on development. The thesis unpacks the ways in which such regimes are deployed using specific technologies: neo-liberal precepts on economic development. To that end, I pose a set of questions which can be summarized in these two: How has higher education in Africa discursively construed Africa&#8217;s experiences? Second, in which terms such constructions have helped responding to Africa&#8217;s problems of development? Taking Mozambican higher education as a unit of analysis, I used postcolonial theory to unsettle neo-liberal regimes of development and to show how contingent they are. Methodologically, a historical critique was carried out to historize neo-liberal globalization as a contingent process and to understand multiple possibilities of construing Africa&#8217;s experiences. My data consisted of texts discussing ways in which Africa is discursively understood by both, African and Western scholarship, higher education policy in Mozambique, interviews with senior administrators of some Mozambican higher education institutions and text materials from higher education institutions&#8217; websites in Mozambique. The findings suggest that, on the one hand, constructions of Africa as being in crisis are not new. In fact, for centuries Africa has always been a subject of knowledge from which the West constructs its differences. It is from such differences that the West assumed a civilizing mission in order to integrate African peoples in the world order. On the other hand, African scholars&#8217; responses to Western constructions of Africa&#8217;s experiences end up building another crisis at the theoretical level: the difficulties of thinking effectively on Africa so as to solve its problems. The second finding is that Mozambican higher education&#8217;s responses to the crisis have been marked by a development agenda within the broader context of Mozambique&#8217;s history from late the 1970s onwards: first, within the socialist model of central planning economy and, second, within the international agenda of global neo-liberal market economy. My analysis suggests that both development practices reflect, to some extent, continuities of colonial regimes of development which did not take into account the contextualities of the colonized. Finally, my investigation found that higher education institutions in Mozambique are responding to development challenges based on very technological conceptions of development following global trends. The thesis contends that an engagement with the ethics of knowledge and development would lead to a development model more preoccupied with the social contexts beyond market rationalities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Africa, developmentalist discourses, higher education, historical critique, neo-liberal globalization, postcolonial theory, post-independent Mozambique, regimes of knowledge.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropsychological Assessment of Recovery after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Karleigh Kwapil</field><field name="description">Mild Traumatic Brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most common forms of acquired neurological damage. However, the term 'mild' TBI is misleading because the physical, cognitive and emotional impairments that can follow from mTBI can be significant. In order to provide objective, prognostic measures for diagnosing the severity of mTBI and identifying individuals who may be at risk for poor outcomes a battery of neuropsychological measures for detecting cognitive impairment was evaluated. The Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) is a collection of tests assessing verbal recall, orientation, processing speed and speed of language comprehension. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RSC has acceptable reliability, validity and sensitivity to cognitive impairment that arises during the acute stages of injury. However, no studies have investigated the predictive validity of this instrument. Moreover it is unclear what additional patient or post injury variables could assist in identifying those individuals who may be at risk of poor neuropsychological outcomes following mTBI. These were among the main issues that were addressed across the five empirical studies in this thesis. A pragmatic, prospective, longitudinal and cross-sectional study of the sequelae of mTBI in patients presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Royal Brisbane and Women's hospital was the basis of this project. The first empirical chapter (chapter 2), examined the psychometric properties of two measures of verbal learning and memory and investigated their potential for discriminating between mTBI and orthopaedic controls. The performance of 93 patients with mTBI and 68 participants with orthopaedic injuries was analysed to identify the number of individuals who performed at ceiling on the Hopkins Verbal Learning test (HVLT-R) versus a 5-word test of immediate and delayed recall. While both of these verbal recall measures were effective in separating the mTBI and orthopaedic groups, overall, the HVLT-R was shown to be a more suitable measure for screening for deficits in verbal learning and memory after mTBI. Given the superiority of the HVLT-R as a measure of verbal learning and memory, chapter 3 aimed to examine whether inclusion of this test could improve the sensitivity of the RSC in mTBI compared to orthopaedic and uninjured control samples. Results were generally within the direction predicted. Significant differences were found between groups on the majority of cognitive indices assessed. Both the orthopaedic and mTBI group performed more poorly than the uninjured group on all measures except the Hopkins delayed recognition. Additional performance decrements shown by the mTBI group compared to the orthopaedic group illustrate that factors beyond the general effects of trauma influence performance and may be related to cognitive impairment specific to sustaining mTBI. Overall it was concluded that the revised RSC is a sensitive instrument deserving investigation in assessing the more long term cognitive effects following mTBI. Chapter 4 applied this sensitive battery for investigation of group and individual recovery of neuropsychological test performance and post-concussive symptom reporting up to 3-months after mTBI. A sample of 30 mTBI participants and 30 uninjured controls were serially assessed on cognitive measures and symptom report scales immediately after injury and after 1-week, 1-month and 3-months. Symptom reporting on the Rivermead post-concussive inventory separated the mTBI and control groups after 1-week but diagnostic accuracy was no greater than chance at 1 and 3-months. In contrast the mTBI group performed more poorly than controls on measures on neuropsychological measures acutely, at 1-week and 1-month, with group differences still evident after 3-months. Nonethless, a trend of progressive recovery over time was seen in the mTBI group. In chapter 5, criteria utilising the concepts of reliable and statistically significant change were applied to the data. Overall, 73% of mTBI patients were impaired on one or more tests acutely. Significant recovery was demonstrated by 20% of mTBI participants by 3-months; however recovery remained incomplete for half of the mTBI participants by 3-months. These results highlighted the importance of an individual approach to the assessment of mTBI and support the notion that a proportion of mTBI cases may have protracted difficulties. Chapter 6 extended these findings by showing that the RSC has prognostic ability. It was found that acute neuropsychological performance on the RSC was a significant predictor of performance on an extended battery at 3-months. The final chapter provides a general discussion and synthesis of the findings. In summary, the present dissertation demonstrated that inclusion of a sensitive measure of verbal recall led to improved diagnostic validity of the RSC. Neuropsychological measures rather than symptom reporting were sensitive in detecting cognitive impairment at 3-months. Analysis of individuals showed that up to 50% of the group had failed to &#8211; demonstrate reliable recovery &#8211; that is, make improvements over and above practice effects after 3-months. Finally, acute neuropsychological performance was predictive of long term performance. Overall, the present thesis has identified a short battery of tests that is suitable for assessment of mTBI within 24 hours and may assist in identifying individuals at risk of poor cognitive outcomes after mTBI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Concussion</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological assessment</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological recovery</field><field name="subject">post concussion syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192563</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Group opinion change and reintegration of deviant group members</field><field name="creator">Khai Huei Chan</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigates two theoretically novel processes of change in groups relevant to agents for change. Specifically, it examines the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on group members&#8217; evaluation of ingroup change-agents. Group opinion change is operationalized as the group adopting the position advocated by a change-agent, and reintegration is operationalized as the group responding more positively towards a change-agent. These formulations of change processes within groups extend past theorizing in opinion deviance research (e.g., Festinger, 1950; Schachter, 1951; Marques &amp; Paez, 1994) by a) examining how contextual differences that result from changes in the group may affect group members&#8217; reactions to opinion deviates, and b) considering contingencies that result in acceptance or rejection of change-agents and their messages. In addition, this thesis investigates the psychological processes that may mediate and moderate the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on appraisals of change-agents. Specifically, it considers attributed motives of change-agents (i.e., perceived constructiveness; Hornsey, 2005), and target prototypicality (e.g., Hogg, 1993; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987) as two possible mediators of these novel effects. Finally, group members&#8217; identification with the group is examined as a moderator of these processes. Chapter 3 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of group opinion change on the evaluation of change-agents. Experiment 1 (N=100) was a scenario-based study that had a change-agent express a non-conformist view of giving water to an outgroup state at a time when the ingroup state was experiencing a water crisis. Experiment 2 (N=103) was a scenario-based study that looked at a change-agent who expressed pro-immigration views to the ingroup country at an earlier time when popular attitudes toward immigration were poor. In both experiments the deviants were marginalized initially because they endorsed non-conformist opinions. Depending on the condition, group opinions either shifted toward the positions advocated by the deviants or remained unchanged. Results showed group members&#8217; target evaluations shifted as a function of group opinion change. Target evaluations became less favourable in Experiment 1, and more favourable in Experiment 2. There also was evidence that increased perceived constructiveness mediated more favourable target evaluations in Experiment 2. Chapter 4 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of reintegration and group members&#8217; identification on the evaluation of change-agents. Both Experiments 3 (N=103) and 4 (N=94) involved a scenario where there was a severe drought in the ingroup state. In Experiment 3, a deviant politician argued for more investment on water infrastructure 10 years earlier when water shortage was not a critical problem. Thus, the politician expressed a minority opinion. In Experiment 4, a deviant water commissioner expressed a controversial opinion to give water to an outgroup state at the height of the drought. Both deviants were marginalized/excluded initially by the group. Reintegration was manipulated by showing that popular support for the deviant had increased (Experiment 3) or the deviant was reinstated (Experiment 4), or the group did not increase support for the deviant at all (not reintegrated). Results showed that high identifiers evaluated the deviant less positively, and perceived the deviant as more destructive after he or she was reintegrated than when marginalization continued. Further, perceived destructiveness mediated the effects of reintegration and identification on trait evaluations. Experiment 4 also showed that high identifiers were less willing to support change after the deviant was reintegrated, than when marginalization continued. Finally, Chapter 5 tested the interactive effects of group opinion change and reintegration on evaluation of change-agents. I also assessed group members&#8217; responses to change-agents in light of the group&#8217;s resistance to change even though the change-agents were right and the groups were wrong. Experiment 5 was a scenario-based study in a minimal-groups situation that had a deviant arguing for a more equitable research funding than the existing distribution. Experiment 6 was a scenario-based study on the disagreement between Galileo Galilei and the Catholic Church on planetary motion. Again, the deviants initially were marginalized by the groups. For opinion change, the groups either adopted or rejected the deviants&#8217; opinions. For reintegration, the groups either treated the deviants more favourably or continued to reject them. Results showed that either opinion change or reintegration was sufficient to defuse negativity towards the deviants. More importantly, group members continued mistreating the deviants when the groups rejected opinion change and reintegration. That is, negativity towards the deviants was highest when opinion was unchanged, and marginalization continued. Overall, this thesis shows that group members&#8217; evaluations of deviant agents for change can shift as a function of group opinion change and reintegration. Group opinion change and/or reintegration defuse negativity toward change-agents in the absence of psychological threat (i.e., perceived destructiveness). However, if threat is present, opinion change or reintegration may ironically elicit more group members&#8217; negativity towards these targets. This thesis also contributes to the literature by showing how change promotes or inhibits group members&#8217; endorsement of change-agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Deviance</field><field name="subject">Dissent</field><field name="subject">Group Opinion change</field><field name="subject">Deviant Reintegration</field><field name="subject">Rejection</field><field name="subject">Threat</field><field name="subject">Criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194547</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Islamic Conceptualisations of Press Freedom in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Nerawi Sedu</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the conceptions of press freedom from the Islamic perspective. It examined how certain segments of Malaysian society, including government officers, religious leaders, members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of political parties, perceive press freedom in their country. Compared to previous studies on media freedom or press freedom in Malaysia, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of variables significantly related to the conceptualisation and practice of press freedom, which include economic development, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and globalisation. One significant difference between this study and previous studies was the specific examination of Islamic conceptions of press freedom, which represents a major contribution to existing knowledge. As Malaysia is a complex multi-racial and multi-religious nation, factors such as national ideologies and cultural values were addressed when examining conceptions of press freedom. Due to the focus of the study, two types of framework were utilised: an Islamic theoretical framework and media theories developed by Western scholars. Methodologically, this study employed an ethnographic approach for analysing Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom. A combination of three qualitative research techniques - in-depth face-to-face interviews, examination of archival documents, and personal observations - was utilised to investigate the issues identified in relation to perceptions of press freedom in Malaysia. In-depth face-to-face interviews involved the participation of staff and members from ten organisations and individuals who were not affiliated with these organisations. The organisations involved in this study were: Ministry of Internal Security Malaysia (MOIS); Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (IKIM); Islamic Da&#8217;wah Foundation Malaysia (YADIM); Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM); Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM); Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ); Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM); Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS), People&#8217;s Justice Party (PKR); and Puteri UMNO. The archival documents analysed in this study were gathered from these ten organisations. However, due to certain organisational policies and security concerns, personal observations were only conducted at eight organisations, IKIM, YADIM, ABIM, JIM, CIJ, SUARAM, PAS and PKR. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the data analysis were triangulated to ascertain the extent to which the information obtained was consistent or inconsistent across sources. The findings of the study showed that there were diverse views among respondents on what constitutes an Islamic press freedom in a multi-racial and multi-religious Malaysia. Due to the different levels of Islamic understanding and divergent interpretations of Islam among Muslims, especially among members of political parties, this study also found that the Islamic theory of press freedom is a highly contested concept. More often than not, the respondents of these organisations claimed that Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom should be based on their personal versions of Islam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom, Islamic perspective, tawhid, conservatism, liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194709</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualization, design, and scaling of drop generation in coflow processes</field><field name="creator">Manuela Duxenneuner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drop formation, coflow, monodispersity, scaling, dimensionless numbers, microfluidics, microPIV, hydroxypropyl-ether guar gum, Tween, sunflower oil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194990</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'&#8216;Because You Demanded It!': Participatory Culture and Superhero Comic Books</field><field name="creator">Taina Lloyd</field><field name="description">Comic books are one of the many popular cultural forms that attract, as part of their audience, a committed readership that engages in a participatory relationship as part of a shared interest in the text. In common with other media forms, this engagement expresses itself in a variety of ways, including interaction with other readers online and face-to-face at conventions, correspondence with producers, and the creation of textual products. Other features of the discourses and practices of this community may be more specific to the comic book readership. One of the most interesting of these is a participatory belief, widely expressed by readers, that they can influence the story content of the published comic book and that comic books are unique among other media forms in this. In this thesis, I investigate several aspects of this belief, in order to offer a more nuanced understanding of the participatory involvement that readers have in comic books, particularly the superhero comic books that dominate American comic book culture. First, I examine whether this participatory belief is supported by evidence from published comic books by undertaking a content analysis of the letter columns and story pages of comic books. Next, I explore the discourses of online comic book culture that relate to authorship and the boundaries of participation and show how the rules of textual engagement that are held by readers shape the interactions between readers and producers. Finally, I look for alternative participatory spaces that are available to comic book readers, finding these in a contested form of engagement with comic books, that of exploring the fictional universes of the text. This approach imagines the text as the representation of a non-actual world, to which the comic book is an incomplete window. Theorising this mode of engagement leads to a conceptualisation of participation that makes visible a participatory space that has been previously overlooked by academic fan studies, and that complicates the existing models of participatory culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">fan culture</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">comic books</field><field name="subject">fictional worlds</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary divergence of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A/B and functional implications</field><field name="creator">Siew Ping Han</field><field name="description">The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are a group of proteins intitially characterised in the late 1980&#8217;s by their presence in complexes that form on nascent RNA transcripts. This definition was purely operational, and was based on protein isolation techniques available at that time. Since then, the tendency to refer to and view the hnRNPs as a protein family has become increasingly prevalent, although there has been no systematic sequence- or structure-based study of their evolutionary history. While the hnRNPs share some structural characteristics (modular structure, presence of RNA-binding domains) and functional properties (binding to RNA, involvement in multiple steps of RNA processing), these criteria also apply to other types of RNA binding proteins (RBPs), such as the SR and ELAV families of proteins. Thus, we have adopted a more methodical and rigorous approach to the classification of hnRNPs and other RBPs, through the phylogenetic analysis of their sequences and domains. Besides establishing phylogenetic relationships and simplifying nomenclature, studying the evolutionary divergence of the hnRNPs is important for understanding their functional features. The hnRNP A/B subfamily is comprised of paralogues A1, A2/B1, A3 and A0, which exhibit a high level of similarity at both the sequence and structural level. While they are often treated as functional homologues, they are not functionally identical. Hence, we undertook a detailed comparison of their sequences, and found that the introduction of novel splicing signals or mutation of existing sequence elements has led to changes in alternative splicing patterns between the paralogues, which may affect the regulation of their expression and their RNA binding properties. In addition, we also investigated species-specific alternative splicing of the hnRNPs A/B, which has significant implications for the interpretation of current research, since different research groups tend to use different model organisms in their experiments. Hence, exploration of the sequence divergence of the hnRNPs A/B has provided some clues as to how their functional differences arose, and also highlighted the need to take species-specific splicing into consideration. Alternative splicing can create functional variation not only between paralogues, but also between splice variants. hnRNP A2/B1, which has a well-established role in mRNA trafficking in neuronal cells, has four spliceoforms. In order to study the contribution of each isoform to this process, we investigated isoform-specific variations in intracellular localisation, and expression in different developmental stages and species. We found that in rat, minor isoform A2b was the predominant isoform in the cytoplasm, and may be the key player in mRNA trafficking. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering individual isoforms (including those expressed in low abundance) when studying the function of alternatively spliced proteins, especially when the function is restricted to a particular subcellular compartment. In addition to its cytoplasmic role in mRNA trafficking, hnRNP A2/B1, and the other hnRNPs A/B, have multiple nuclear functions, including packaging of nascent transcripts, nuclear export of mRNA, regulation of alternative splicing and telomere maintenance. These processes take place in discrete regions within the nucleus, and thus we examined the subnuclear distribution of the hnRNPs A/B. We found that hnRNP A1 had a localisation pattern distinct from that of A2/B1 and A3, and that these patterns were spatially and temporally regulated. Hence, the evolutionary divergence of the hnRNPs A/B has affected the localisation, expression and splicing patterns of these proteins, which we have examined at multiple levels, including comparisons across all hnRNPs, within the hnRNP A/B paralogues, and between the hnRNP A2/B1 splice variants. As the hnRNPs A/B are involved in almost every step in RNA processing, this functional diversity has significant implications for transcriptomic complexity. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of taking species- and isoform-specific differences into account when investigating protein function. In conclusion, this study of the hnRNPs A/B provides a conceptual framework for exploring the relationships between sequence, structural and functional divergence, which may be applicable to protein families in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">hnRNPs</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">alternative splicing</field><field name="subject">mRNA trafficking</field><field name="subject">subnuclear localisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stepping stones towards linear optical quantum computing</field><field name="creator">Till Weinhold</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis form an investigation into the path towards establishing the requirements of quantum computing in a linear optical system. Our qubits are polarisation encoded photons for which the basic operations of quantum computing, single qubit rotations, are a well understood problem. The difficulty lies in the interaction of photons. To achieve these we use measurement induced non-linearities. The first experiment in this thesis describes the thorough characterisation of a controlled-sign gate based on such non-linearities. The photons are provided as pairs generated through parametric down-conversion, and as such share correlations unlikely to carry over into large scale implementations of the future. En route to such larger circuits, a characterisation of the actions of the controlled-sign gate is conducted, when the input qubits have been generated independently from each other, revealing a large drop in process fidelity. To explore the cause of this degradation of the gate performance a thorough and highly accurate model of the gate is derived including the realistic description of faulty circuitry, photon loss and multi-photon emission by the source. By simulating the effects of the various noise sources individually, the heretofore largely ignored multi-photon emission is identified as the prime cause of the degraded gate performance, causing a drop in fidelity nearly three times as large as any other error source. I further draw the first comparison between the performance of an experimental gate to the error probabilities per gate derived as thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In the absence of a single vigourous threshold value, I compare the gate performance to the models that yielded the highest threshold to date as an upper bound and to the threshold of the Gremlin-model, which allows for the most general errors. Unsurprisingly this comparison reveals that the implemented gate is clearly insufficient, however just remedying the multi-photon emission error will allow this architecture to move to within striking distance of the boundary for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The utilised methodology can be applied to any gate in any architecture and can, combined with a suitable model of the noise sources, become an important guide for developments required to achieve fault tolerant quantum computing. The final experiment on the path towards linear optical quantum computing is the demonstration of a pair of basic versions of Shor's algorithm which display the essential entanglement for the algorithm. The results again highlight the need for extensive measurements to reveal the fundamental quality of the implemented algorithm, which is not accessible with limited indicative measurements. In the second part of the thesis, I describe two experiments on other forms of entanglement by extending the actions of a Fock-State filter, a filter that is capable of attenuating single photon states stronger than multi-photon states, to produce entangled states. Furthermore this device can be used in conjunction with standard wave-plates to extend the range of operations possible on the bi-photonic qutrit space, showing that this setup suffices to produce any desired qutrit state, thereby giving access to new measurement capabilities and in the process creating and proving the first entanglement between a qubit and a qutrit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum information</field><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">Quantum computing</field><field name="subject">Linear optical quantum computing</field><field name="subject">Pulsed Parametric Down-conversion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204520</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive crosstalk cancellation and Lattice aided detection in multi-user communications</field><field name="creator">Mandar Gujrathi</field><field name="description">Digital subscriber lines (DSL) have revolutionised the provision of high speed data over the &#8216;last mile&#8217;. Subscribers demand even more bandwidth and the penetration of the service is now nearly universal. While it is feasible to provide improved broadband services on the new very high speed DSL, such as VDSL2/3, one of the greatest challenges to further improvements in speed is the problem of crosstalk. Operating over the unused higher frequencies of the twisted pair network, this technology is subjected to electromagnetic coupling among the wires, limiting the DSL data rate and service reach. Crosstalk suppression methods such as zero-forcing or decision feedback mainly use block processing. However, to cope with the time-varying VDSL environment huge computational costs can be incurred. In contrast, adaptive processing approaches are much simpler and are more beneficial to track such a channel environment. An adaptive canceller uses a training sequence and the convergence speed depends on the number of crosstalk coefficients it has to estimate. In a populated DSL binder, only a few of the crosstalking neighbours to a particular user are significant. With the aim to reduce the computational complexity in such environments, this thesis introduces the concept of detection-guided adaptive crosstalk cancellation for DSL. We propose a least-squares test feature to detect and concentrate the adaptation only on the dominant crosstalking coefficients. In comparison to conventional adaptive cancellers, the cancellers proposed in this thesis demonstrate early convergence. Thus, by incorporating the test feature, these cancellers have to detect only the most significant canceller coefficients and therefore, the length of the training sequence is reduced. Together with enhanced adaptive cancellation with a low run-time complexity and improved convergence, the greatest advantage obtained here is in the bandwidth efficiency. While enhanced adaptive cancellation is a bandwidth-efficient approach, the frequent re-transmission of training sequences may still be required for a rapidly changing VDSL channel. Again, this can be a disadvantage in terms of bandwidth consumption. To overcome this difficulty, we propose fast-converging unsupervised cancellers with an aim to improve the bandwidth efficiency by not transmitting a training sequence. An added advantage obtained here is that this would enable Internet service providers to include multiple or improved broadband services within a single subscription. Certain properties of the DSL channel ensure the communication channel is properly conditioned. This ensures the basis vectors of the channel matrix are near-orthogonal and hence, the linear cancellers, such as zero-forcing perform near-optimally. However, this is not the case with wireless channels. We investigate user detection in wireless channels using the principle of lattice reduction. User detection can also be seen as a search for the closest vector point in the lattice of received symbols. Though a maximum likelihood (ML) detector facilitates optimal user-detection, it has exponential complexity. We identify that the closest vector problem can be cast as a non-linear optimisation problem. Using the periodicity of the maximum likelihood function, we first present a novel algorithm that approximates the ML function using the Taylor series expansion of a suitable cosine function. With the aim of minimising the approximation error, we represent the ML function as a Fourier Series expansion and later, propose another approximation using Jacobi theta functions. We study the performance of these approximations when subjected to a suitable unconstrained optimisation algorithm. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the newly-developed approximations perform better than the conventional cancellers, close to the ML and, importantly, converging in polynomial time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adaptive, partial crosstalk cancellation, detection guided, blind crosstalk cancellation, adaptation, activity criterion, lattice reduction, Jacobi-theta function approximation, Taylor series approximation, non-linear optimisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205528</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Optical Flow for Indoor Mobile Robot Obstacle Avoidance.</field><field name="creator">Tobias Low</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the use of visual-motion information sampled through optical flow for the task of indoor obstacle avoidance on autonomous mobile robots. The methods focus on the practical use of optical flow and visual motion information in performing the obstacle avoidance task in real indoor environments. The methods serve to identify visual-motion properties that must be used in synergy with visual-spatial properties toward the goal of a complete robust visual-only obstacle avoidance system, as is evidently seen within nature. A review of vision-based obstacle avoidance techniques shows that early research mainly focused on visual-spatial techniques, which heavily rely on various assumptions of their environments to function successfully. On the other hand, more current research that looks toward the use of visual-motion information (sampled through optical flow) tends to focus on using optical flow in a subsidiary manner, and does not completely take advantage of the information encoded within an optical flow field. In the light of the current research limitations, this thesis describes two different approaches and evaluates their use of optical flow to perform the obstacle avoidance task. The first approach begins with the construction of a conventional range map using optical flow that stems from the structure-from-motion domain and the theory that optical flow encodes 3D environmental information under certain conditions. The second approach investigates optical flow in a causal mechanistic manner using machine learning of motor responses directly from optical flow - motivated from physical and behavioural evidence observed in biological creatures. Specifically, the second approach is designed with three main objectives in mind: 1) to investigate whether optical flow can be learnt for obstacle avoidance; 2) to create a system capable of repeatable obstacle avoidance performance in real-life environments; and 3) to analyse the system to determine what optical flow properties are actually being used for the motor control task. The range-map reconstruction results have demonstrated some good distance estimations through the use of a feature-based optical flow algorithm. However, the number of flow points were too sparse to provide adequate obstacle detection. Results froma differential-based optical flow algorithm helped to increase the density of flow points, but highlighted the high sensitivity of the optical flow field to the rotational errors and outliers that plague the majority of frames under real-life robot situations. Final results demonstrated that current optical flow algorithms are ill-suited to estimate obstacle distances consistently, as range-estimation techniques require an extremely accurate optical flow field with adequate density and coverage for success. This is a difficult problem within the optical flow estimation domain itself. In the machine learning approach, an initial study to examine whether optical flow can be machine learnt for obstacle avoidance and control in a simple environment was successful. However,there were certain problems. Several critical issues which arise with the use of a machine learning approach were highlighted. These included sample set completeness, sample set biases, and control system instability. Consequently, an extended neural network was proposed that had several improvements made to overcome the initial problems. Designing an automated system for gathering training data helped to eliminate most of the sample set problems. Key changes in the neural network architecture, optical flow filters, and navigation technique vastly improved the control system stability. As a result, the extended neural network system was able to successfully perform multiple obstacle avoidance loops in both familiar and unfamiliar real-life environments without collisions. The lap times of the machine learning approach were comparable to those of the laser-based navigation technique. The the machine learning approach was 13% slower in the familiar and 25% slower in the unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, through analysis of the neural network approach, flow magnitudes were revealed to be learnt for range information in an absolute manner, while flow directions were used to detect the focus of expansion (FOE) in order to predict critical collision situations and improve control stability. In addition, the precision of the flow fields was highlighted as an important requirement, as opposed to the high accuracy of flow vectors. For robot control purposes, image-processing techniques such as region finding and object boundary detection were employed to detect changes between optical flow vectors in the image space.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">optical flow</field><field name="subject">obstacle avoidance</field><field name="subject">visual motion</field><field name="subject">mobile robots</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">neural network</field><field name="subject">navigation</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206815</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytogenetics and speciation in Drosophila tetrachaeta Angus.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Donald Scott.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Drosophila.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215431</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the mechanics of high energy flames applied to the penetration of rocks</field><field name="creator">Just, G.

It argues that the history of technology in the Australian music economy is dependent not only upon the changing technical characteristics of musical instruments and electronic consumer goods but also upon government policy-making, management practices in music technology manufacturing firms and patterns of music technology consumption. The thesis examines economic statistics regarding the import, export and local production of music technology in Australia. The economic statistics have not previously been examined in relation to the history of music technology in Australia. The historical analysis is structured according to a four-part periodisation which includes the Electric Age (1901-1930), the Electronic Age (1930-1950), the Transistor Age (1950-1970) and the Information Age (1970-1990). This periodisation enables the analysis to continually be refocussed as the key technological and socio-economic dynamics change. With this perspective, the history of the relationship between technology and organisation in the Australian music economy has been demonstrated to be dependent on a number of key technological changes. The thesis examines changes including the shift from acoustic to electric recording; the development of transistor-based consumer electronics goods; and the advent of digital information technology. However, a number of key social determinants, particularly organisational modes, are examined including changes from protectionist to more deregulated trade policy; lack of business skills in areas such as marketing, manufacturing technique and industrial research and development; and the development of a sense of popular modernity which is expressed in the consumption of new, technically advanced and glamorous music technology. In addition to the new perspectives on the history of music technology provided by the analysis of empirical economic data, this thesis contributes to the historiography of technology. The analytical framework it proposes locates music technology within what is described as an assemblage of technologies: technologies of production, technologies of sign systems, technologies of power and technologies of the self. This approach makes clear the interdependence of technological and social factors, and the inadequacy of narrow technological determinist and social constructivist accounts. The notion of an assemblage of technologies is further embellished by drawing upon key elements of recent theories of systems analysis: the seamless web, evolution and chaos theory. Through this analytical framework and the socio-economic analysis of the relationship between music technology and organisational practices, the thesis demonstrates that the history of technology cannot be understood unless it is seen as part of a complex and interacting technical, social, economic and institutional system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410199 Performing Arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">359999 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">340301 Economic History</field><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">420399 Cultural Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">370601 History and Philosophy of Science and Technology</field><field name="subject">370602 Sociology and Social Studies of Science and Technology</field><field name="subject">350299 Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Australian history</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">music industry</field><field name="subject">history of technology</field><field name="subject">technological change</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:10774</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recreational Exposure To Freshwater Cyanobacteria: Epidemiology, Dermal Toxicity And Biological Activity Of Cyanobacterial Lipopolysaccharides</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Ian</field><field name="description">Cyanobacteria are common inhabitants of freshwater lakes and reservoirs throughout the world. Under favourable conditions, certain cyanobacteria can dominate the phytoplankton within a waterbody and form nuisance blooms. Case reports and anecdotal references dating from 1949 describe a range of illnesses associated with recreational exposure to cyanobacteria: hay fever-like symptoms, pruritic skin rashes and gastro-intestinal symptoms (the latter probably related to ingestion of water) are most frequently reported. Some papers give convincing descriptions of allergic responses to cyanobacteria; others describe more serious acute illnesses, with symptoms such as severe headache, pneumonia, fever, myalgia, vertigo and blistering in the mouth. A U.S. coroner recently found that a teenage boy died as a result of accidentally ingesting a neurotoxic cyanotoxin from a golf course pond; this is the first recorded human fatality attributed to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria. One of the main public health concerns with exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria relates to the understanding that some blooms produce toxins that specifically affect the liver or the central nervous system. The route of exposure for these toxins is oral, from accidental or deliberate ingestion of recreational water, and possibly by inhalation. Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are also reported to be putative cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory and pyrogenic toxins. The aims of this project were to enhance the understanding of public health issues relating to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria by conducting epidemiological and laboratory-based toxicology studies. A prospective cohort study of 1,331 recreational water users was conducted at various sites in southern Queensland, the Myall Lakes area of New South Wales, and central Florida. The study design sought to make improvements over previously published epidemiological studies, in that an unexposed group was recruited from cyanobacteria-free waters, cyanobacterial toxins were measured in site water samples, and respondents were asked to rate the severity of reported symptoms. This study has shown an increased likelihood of symptom reporting amongst bathers exposed to high cyanobacterial cell density (measured by total cell surface area) compared to those exposed to low cyanobacteria-affected waters. Mild respiratory symptoms appear to be the predominant symptom category. A clinical dermatology study to examine delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions to cyanobacterial extracts was conducted. The study groups were 20 patients presenting for diagnostic skin patch testing at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's dermatology outpatient clinic; a convenience sample of 20 individuals was recruited from outside the hospital as a control group. One patient developed unequivocal reactions to several cyanobacteria extracts, with no dose-response pattern seen, indicating that the reactions were allergic in nature. A mouse model of delayed-contact hypersensitivity, the mouse ear swelling test, has demonstrated that the purified toxin cylindrospermopsin, a highly water-soluble compound, is capable of producing cutaneous injury. Encrusting lesions were seen on abdominal skin during the induction phase of these experiments. Delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions were also demonstrated with this toxin. LPS from two non-axenic cyanobacterial samples - Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa - were extracted and purified. Thermoregulation studies were performed using a mouse model of rectal temperature measurement. Separate groups of mice were injected with these LPS extracts at two dose levels. Thermoregulation studies were also conducted with purified cyanobacterial toxins: microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a; cyanobacterial LPS samples purified by collaborators in Adelaide were also investigated for thermoregulation potential. These experiments have shown that the LPS extracts are weakly active when compared with responses to much lower doses of Escherichia coli LPS. Cylindrospermopsin also produces hypothermic responses in mice - comparable to pyrexia in larger mammals - although at a later stage than was seen with LPS extracts. Supplementing the experimental observations of the toxicology and immunotoxicology of cyanobacterial LPS are insights gained from beyond the cyanobacteria literature on the mechanisms of toxicity of different LPS structures. Cyanobacterial LPS was initially suggested to be toxic in the 1970s, at a time when lipid A, the active moiety of LPS, was thought to be identical across all Gram-negative bacteria. More recent work raises questions about the attribution of cutaneous and gastrointestinal illness to cyanobacterial LPS, with the understanding that some bacterial lipid A structures are LPS antagonists, LPS is not toxic by the oral route, and LPS is not reported as a toxin in the clinical dermatology literature. Gut-derived lipopolysaccharides, however, exert potent synergistic effects with a variety of xenobiotic hepatotoxins, and the well-known shock-like syndromes associated with severe cylindrospermopsin and microcystin poisoning deserve further scrutiny from the perspective of immunotoxicology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321201 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety</field><field name="subject">321299 Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730210 Environmental health</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">blue-green algae</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">health effects</field><field name="subject">recreational</field><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">recreational water</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">cutaneous</field><field name="subject">lipopolysaccharide</field><field name="subject">thermoregulation</field><field name="subject">immunotoxicology</field><field name="subject">innate immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9880</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecoturismo e Culturas Tradicionais Estudo de Caso: Martim de Sa</field><field name="creator">Sinay, Laura</field><field name="description">Enquanto alguns paises tem o ecoturismo como a sua principal fonte de renda, o Brasil nao explora a atividade de forma planejada, o que resulta, muitas vezes, na degradacao do meio  ambiente e na descaracterizacao da diversidade cultural local.

Data for the analysis of the relationships between socioeconomic factors and tree management behaviour and intentions and the construction of a typology of rural households in Leyte was gathered from four case study communities on the Island. Following focus group discussions in each of the participating communities to gather background data and populate the structured interview schedule, representative samples of 50 households were selected and interviewed in each of the four communities. Analysis of the present tree management activities of households in the four communities revealed that most households surveyed (approximately 80%) indicated that they are presently managing at least a few trees, the primary purpose of most tree management activities being to supply timber for the households' own needs. Only 10% of respondents indicated that they intend to sell trees they are presently managing, and 25% stated that they intend to plant and manage trees for the production of timber for sale in the future. Approximately 60% of responding households indicated an interest in developing commercial tree farming on the land they manage. Thus it is concluded that small-scale commercial tree growing is uncommon in the communities involved in the survey, and that many households are interested in developing their tree planting and management activities but feel constrained from participation by various factors. The first level of exploration of the socioeconomic factors affecting rural households' tree management behaviour involved univariate analyses of the relationships between households' tree management behaviour and intentions, their socioeconomic characteristics and their attitudes to forestry. The level of resources controlled by the household, in terms of the area of the land managed by the household, their tenurial security and their cash income, are correlated with higher levels of participation in forestry activities, and greater intentions to plant higher numbers of trees in the future. Some farming system variables are also related to higher levels of tree planting and management activity, including the management of livestock and of farm plots distant from their house. While control over higher than average levels of productive resources are, in general, positively correlated to the active management of trees on their land, there are patterns of exceptions to this trend. The exploration of the interrelationships between socioeconomic factors and attitudes affecting households' tree management behaviour was undertaken through the definition of a typology of rural households in relation to forestry. Five types were defined, each having different attitudes to forestry activities. The interpretation of the types was undertaken by describing and comparing the socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics of the types in the typology. The types were characterised by differences in their control of productive resources, differences in their present and intended levels and types of forestry activity, and by differences in their participation in training activities run by development programs. The characteristics of the types were found to correspond highly with descriptions of the socioeconomic factors affecting forestry activities of smallholder households reported by previous studies into and theories about the socioeconomic factors affecting smallholder forestry development. The typology of rural households does help to describe and interpret the variation within each of the four communities in terms of households' attitudes to forestry development and their socioeconomic characteristics. It is concluded that these variations between households mean that the various types of households will be affected in different ways by forestry development programs. It is also concluded that the present state of forestry policies and the market for timber products is such that substantial increase in the level of forestry activity by smallholders is unlikely without comprehensive land use planning, policy reform in regards to tree registration and transport permits, and market development. Recommendations for further research and policy development arising from the thesis focuses on the need to create enabling conditions in which forestry activities can occur and on ways to address the differing needs of the various types defined in the typology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370102 Social Policy and Planning</field><field name="subject">300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="subject">340202 Environment and Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">720302 Assistance and protection</field><field name="subject">300604 Management and Environment</field><field name="subject">620399 Forestry not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Leyte Province</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">rural households</field><field name="subject">tree management</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">typology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9474</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ecology of Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus</field><field name="creator">Field, Hume E.</field><field name="description">Chapter one introduces the concept of disease emergence and factors associated with emergence. The role of wildlife as reservoirs of emerging diseases and specifically the history of  bats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases is previewed. Finally, the aims and structure of the thesis are outlined. In Chapter two, the literature relating to the emergence of Hendra virus, Nipah  virus, and Australian bat lyssavirus, the biology of flying foxes, methodologies for investigating wildlife reservoirs of disease, and the modelling of disease in wildlife populations is reviewed.  Chapter three describes the search for the origin of Hendra virus and investigations of the ecology of the virus. In a preliminary survey of wildlife, feral and pest species, 6/21 Pteropus alecto  and 5/6 P. conspicillatus had neutralizing antibodies to Hendra virus. A subsequent survey found 548/1172 convenience-sampled flying foxes were seropositive. Analysis using logistic regression  identified species, age, sample method, sample location and sample year, and the interaction terms age*species and age* sample method as significantly associated with HeV serostatus. Analysis of a  subset of the data also identified a significant or near-significant association between time of year of sampling and HeV serostatus. In a retrospective survey, 16/68 flying fox sera collected  between 1982 and 1984 were seropositive. Targeted surveillance of non-flying fox wildlife species found no evidence of Hendra virus. The findings indicate that flying foxes are a likely reservoir  host of Hendra virus, and that the relationship between host and virus is mature. The transmission and maintenance of Hendra virus in a captive flying fox population is investigated in Chapter  four. In study 1, neutralizing antibodies to HeV were found in 9/55 P. poliocephalus and 4/13 P. alecto. Titres ranged from 1:5 to 1:160, with a median of 1:10. In study 2, blood and throat and  urogenital swabs from 17 flying foxes from study 1 were collected weekly for 14 weeks. Virus was isolated from the blood of a single aged non-pregnant female on one occasion. In study 3, a  convenience sample of 19 seropositive and 35 seronegative flying foxes was serologically monitored monthly for all or part of a two-year period. Three individuals (all pups born during the study)  seroconverted, and three individuals that were seropositive on entry became seronegative. Two of the latter were pups born during the study period. Dam serostatus and pup serostatus at second bleed  were strongly associated when data from both years were combined (p&lt;0.001; RR=9, 95%CI 1.42 to 57.12). The serial titres of 19 flying foxes monitored for 12 months or longer showed a rising and  falling pattern (10), a static pattern (1) or a falling pattern (8). The findings suggest latency and vertical transmission are features of HeV infection in flying foxes. Chapter five describes  Australian bat lyssavirus surveillance in flying foxes, insectivorous bats and archived museum bat specimens. In a survey of 1477 flying foxes, 69/1477 were antigen-positive (all opportunistic  specimens) and 12/280 were antibody-positive. Species (p&lt;0.001), age (p=0.02), sample method (p&lt;0.001) and sample location (p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with fluorescent antibody  status. There was also a significant association between rapid focus fluorescent inhibition test status and species (p=0.01), sample method (p=0.002) and sample location (p=0.002). There was a  near-significant association (p=0.067) between time of year of sampling and fluorescent antibody status. When the analysis was repeated on P. scapulatus alone, the association stronger (p=0.054). A  total of 1234 insectivorous bats were surveyed, with 5/1162 antigen&#8211;positive (all opportunistic specimens) and 10/390 antibody-positive. A total of 137 archived bats from 10 species were tested for  evidence of Australian bat lyssavirus infection by immunohistochemistry (66) or rapid focus fluorescent inhibition test (71). None was positive by either test but 2 (both S. flaviventris) showed  round basophilic structures consistent with Negri bodies on histological examination. The findings indicate that Australian bat lyssavirus infection is endemic in Australian bats, that submitted  sick and injured bats (opportunistic specimens) pose an increased public health risk, and that Australian bat lyssavirus infection may have been present in Australian bats 15 years prior to its  first description. In Chapter six, deterministic state-transition models are developed to examine the dynamics of HeV infection in a hypothetical flying fox population. Model 1 outputs demonstrated  that the rate of transmission and the rate of recovery are the key parameters determining the rate of spread of infection, and that population size is positively associated with outbreak size and  duration. The Model 2 outputs indicated that that long-term maintenance of infection is inconsistent with lifelong immunity following infection and recovery. Chapter seven discusses alternative  hypotheses on the emergence and maintenance of Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus in Australia. The preferred hypothesis is that both Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus are  primarily maintained in P. scapulatus populations, and that change in the population dynamics of this species due to ecological changes has precipitated emergence. Future research recommendations  include further observational, experimental and/or modeling studies to establish or clarify the route of HeV excretion and the mode of transmission in flying foxes, the roles of vertical  transmission and latency in the transmission and maintenance of Hendra virus in flying foxes, and the dynamics of Hendra virus infection in flying foxes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">300510 Virology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">emerging disease</field><field name="subject">hendra virus</field><field name="subject">henipavirus</field><field name="subject">lyssavirus</field><field name="subject">disease ecology</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">bat</field><field name="subject">flying fox</field><field name="subject">pteropus</field><field name="subject">Hendra virus</field><field name="subject">Bat lyssavirus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:13859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpersonal perceptions in hypnosis: An interactional perspective</field><field name="creator">Whitehead, S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106847</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling low-density flow in hypersonic impulse facilities</field><field name="creator">Wheatley, V.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105621</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toxicology of compounds from the cyanobacterium cylindrospermopsis raciborskii</field><field name="creator">Norris, R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">730199 Clinical health not specific to particular organs, diseases and conditions</field><field name="subject">730210 Environmental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106319</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a political theory of Star Trek</field><field name="creator">Irvine, S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360104 Political Theory and Political Philosophy</field><field name="subject">750601 Understanding political systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105667</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting and family support in primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Turner, Karen Mary Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">730204 Child health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106448</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tripartite model of anxiety and depression: A new look at theory and measurement</field><field name="creator">Boschen, M.

Both investigate the abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal scale of existence. The focus of the research has been on giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. They constitute &lt;0.001% of the total number of deposits yet contain 70-85% of the world's metal resources. Giants are the definitive exploration targets. They are more profitable to exploit and less susceptible to fluctuations of the market. Consensus has it that the same processes that generate small deposits also form giants but those processes are simply longer, vaster, and larger. Heat is the dominant factor in the genesis of giant mineral deposits. A paleothermal map shows where the vast heat required to generate a giant has been concentrated in a large space, and even allows us to deduce the duration of the process. To generate a paleothermal map acceptable to the scientific community requires reproducibility. Experimentation with various approaches to pattern recognition of geochemical data showed that the AUTOCLUST algorithm not only gave reproducibility but also gave the most consistent, most meaningful results. It automatically extracts boundaries based on Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations. The user does not specify parameters; however, the modeller does have tools to explore the data. This approach is near ideal in that it removes much of the human-generated bias. This algorithm reveals the radial, spatial distribution, of gold deposits in the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern Australia at two distinct scales &#8211; repeating patterns every ~80 km and ~230 km. Both scales of patterning are reflected in the geology. The ~80 km patterns are nested within the ~230 km patterns revealing a self-similar, geometrical relationship. It is proposed that these patterns originate from Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle. At the Rayleigh Number appropriate for the mantle, the stable planform is the spoke pattern, where hot mantle material is moving upward near the centre of the pattern and outward along the radial arms. Discontinuities in the mantle, Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle, and the spatial distribution of giant mineral deposits, are correlative. The discontinuities in the Earth are acting as platforms from which Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection can originate. Shallow discontinuities give rise to plumelets, which manifest at the crust as repeating patterns ranging, from ~100 to ~1,000 km in diameter. Deeper discontinuities give rise to plumes, which become apparent at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;1,000 to ~4,000 km in diameter. The deepest discontinuities give rise to the superplumes, which become detectable at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;4,000 to &gt;10,000 km in diameter. Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection concentrates the reservoir of heat in the mantle into specific locations in the crust; thereby providing the vast heat requirements for the processes that generate giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. The radial spatial distribution patterns observed for gold deposits are also present for base metal deposits. At the supergiant Broken Hill deposit in far western New South Wales, Australia, the higher temperature Broken Hill-type deposits occur in a radial pattern while the lower temperature deposits occur in concentric patterns. The supergiant Broken Hill deposit occurs at the very centre of the pattern. If the supergiant Broken Hill Deposit was buried beneath alluvium, water or younger rocks, it would now be possible to predict its location with accuracy measured in tens of square kilometres. This predictive accuracy is desired by every exploration manager of every exploration company. The giant deposits at Broken Hill, Olympic Dam, and Mount Isa all occur on the edge of an annulus. There are at least two ways of creating an annulus on the Earth's surface. One is through Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection and the other is through meteor impact. It is likely that only 'large' meteors (those &gt;10 km in diameter) would have any permanent impact on the mantle. Lesser meteors would leave only a superficial scar that would be eroded away. The permanent scars in the mantle act as &#8216;accidental templates&#8217; consisting of concentric and possibly radial fractures that impose those structures on any rocks that were subsequently laid down or emplaced over the mantle. In southeastern Australia, the proposed Deniliquin Impact structure has been an 'accidental template' providing a 'line-of-least-resistance' for the ascent of the ~2,000 km diameter, offshore, Cape Howe Plume. The western and northwestern radial arms of this plume have created the very geometry of the Lachlan Fold Belt, as well as giving rise to the spatial distribution of the granitic rocks in that belt and ultimately to the gold deposits. The interplay between the templating of the mantle by meteor impacts and the ascent of plumelets, plumes or superplumes from various discontinuities in the mantle is quite possibly the reason that mineral deposits occur where they do.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">269900 Other Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">giant ore deposits</field><field name="subject">multifractal</field><field name="subject">mineral deposit model</field><field name="subject">Complexity Theory</field><field name="subject">Lachlan Fold Belt</field><field name="subject">General Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection</field><field name="subject">Broken Hill Deposit</field><field name="subject">Olympic Dam Deposit</field><field name="subject">Mount Isa Deposit</field><field name="subject">deterministic chaos</field><field name="subject">nonlinear dynamics</field><field name="subject">paleothermal</field><field name="subject">plumes</field><field name="subject">temporal</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">fractal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:107702</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-thinking helping and altruism: A social identity perspective</field><field name="creator">Lai, S. H.</field><field name="description">Research on helping and altruism has been revitalized by the shift in focus from individual and interpersonal processed to group processed in the last decade. In particular, the social identity approach (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979; Turner, 1985; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987), which ahs been increasingly applied to helping situations, has provided a valuable group perspective on helping behaviour. The significance of social groups and shared identity for altruism has also been suggested (e.g., Monroe, 1996; Sober &amp; Wilson, 1998). Although helping and altruism are typically undifferentiated, central to altruism is the issue of motivation, which as additional theoretical and applied implications. The eight studies reported in this thesis aimed to build upon current social identity research on helping behaviour and to extend the social identity approach to altruism. In line with the social identity perspective, factors associated with group membership were expected to have important implication for individual helping decisions, especially among high identifying group members. Studies 1 to 3 tested the combined effects of target group membership and group identification on individual helping intentions. In all three studies, participant completed an ingroup identification scale and reported their intentions to help the target, who was either an ingroup or an outgroup member. Consistent with expectations, high identifiers were willing to offer more help to a more ingroup-like target in study 1 (N = 141). However, in Study 2 (N = 93). High identifiers offered more help to an outgroup than to an ingroup target. In an attempt to clarify these conflicting finding, Study 3 (N = 138) examined group members&#8217; helping responses in a group-relevant and a group-irrelevant helping situation. Results indicated that high identifiers were more willing to help an outgroup target when the helping situation was group-irrelevant rather than group-relevant. The helping intentions of low identifiers were largely unaffected by the group membership of the target or the group-relevance of the helping dimension. In a further analysis of the impact of target group membership on helping behaviour, Study 4 considered the moderating effects of perceived need on intergroup helping decisions. Using a realistic helping paradigm, participants (N = 94) heard a voice recording of a request for help from either an ingroup or an outgroup target, who expressed either a high or a low need for help. Where as people were more likely to help the ingroup than the outgroup target when there was a high need for help, the group membership of the target did not affect helping decisions when the need for help was low. While Studies 1 to 4 elaborated on the role of social identity factors in intergroup helping contexts, Studies 5 and 6 Focused on helping with intragroup contexts by considering how the intragroup position of the target can also influence people&#8217;s helping intentions. In Study 5 (N = 166), social identity salience was manipulated, whereas ingroup identification was measured in Study 6 (N = 118). Participants in both studies were then presented with a profile of either a prototypical or a non-prototypical target and were asked to indicate their helping intentions. As predicted, people who perceived their ingroup identity to be more salient (Study 5) or identified more highly with the ingroup (Study 6) were willing to offer more help to the prototypical than to the non-prototypical target. In addition, concern for the target was found to be a mediator in predicting individual helping intentions. The final two studies investigated social identity processed in field settings. Study 7 (N =618) assessed both helping intentions and behaviour in the context of a charity door-knock appeal. Respondents in both studies completed a survey, which included measures of group identification, concern, and helping intentions. Greater identification with the group was associated with increased willingness to contribute to the community (Study 7) and intentions to donate more money to the door-knock appeal (Study 8). Further more, the relationship between group identification and individual helping intentions was mediated by concern. Together, these eight studies highlighted the complexities of social identity influences on helping behavior as well as the contributions that the social identity approach can make to the study of helping and altruism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:119790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgements of style: People, pigeons, and Picasso</field><field name="creator">Stephanie C. Goodhew</field><field name="description">Judgements of and sensitivity to style are ubiquitous. People become sensitive to the structural regularities of complex or &#8220;polymorphous&#8221; categories through exposure to individual examples, which allows them respond to new items that are of the same style as those previously experienced. This thesis investigates whether a dimension reduction mechanism could account for how people learn about the structure of complex categories. That is, whether through experience, people extract the primary dimensions of variation in a category and use these to analyse and categorise subsequent instances. We used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as the method of dimension reduction, which yields the main dimensions of variation of pixel-based stimuli (eigenvectors). We then tested whether a simple autoassociative network could learn to distinguish paintings by Picasso and Braque which were reconstructed from only these primary dimensions of variation. The network could correctly classify the stimuli, and its performance was optimal with reconstructions based on just the first few eigenvectors. Then we reconstructed the paintings using either just the first 10 (early reconstructions) or all 1,894 eigenvectors (full reconstructions), and asked human participants to categorise the images. We found that people could categorise the images with either the early or full reconstructions. Therefore, people could learn to distinguish category membership based on the reduced set of dimensions obtained from SVD. This suggests that a dimension reduction mechanism analogous to SVD may be operating when people learn about the structure and regularities in complex categories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Concept formation</field><field name="subject">Category learning</field><field name="subject">Computational modelling</field><field name="subject">Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138885</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Plasma Membrane Calcium-ATPase in Mammary Gland Epithelial Cell Lines and Consequences of its Inhibition in a Model of Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Lee, Won Jae</field><field name="description">Ionized calcium (Ca2+), acting as an intracellular messenger, controls numerous biological processes that are essential for life. However, it is also able to convey signals that result in cell death. The fidelity of Ca2+ as a universal second messenger therefore depends on mechanisms that specifically and dynamically regulate its levels within a cell, as well as maintain resting intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) very low. One such mechanism for Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis is the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), which is a primary active Ca2+ transporter that translocates Ca2+ from a low intracellular Ca2+ environment to a high extracellular environment. There are four mammalian PMCA isoforms (PMCA1&#8722;4), which are differentially expressed depending on tissue or cell type. PMCA isoforms possess different sensitivities to biochemical regulation of Ca2+ efflux activity and are also able to subtly alter the dynamics of Ca2+ signals. These properties suggest that the PMCA is not merely a trivial mechanism for Ca2+ extrusion but is influential in contributing to the Ca2+ signaling requirements and unique physiology of different cells. The indispensable nature of Ca2+ signaling in organs such as the brain, heart and skeletal muscle has been the studied extensively but little is known about the roles and regulation of Ca2+ in the mammary gland. This is despite the fact that the mammary gland is a site of extensive Ca2+ flux during lactation. However, cumulating evidence indicates that upregulation of PMCA2 expression in the mammary gland is a major mechanism for milk Ca2+ enrichment. Therefore, the PMCA is likely to be an important mediator of bulk Ca2+ homeostasis in the mammary gland. Studies in other model systems also suggest that PMCAs may regulate other cellular processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis that are required for normal mammary gland physiology. These basic cellular processes are also disturbed in breast cancer and hence deregulation of PMCA expression in the mammary gland may have pathophysiological consequences. Previous studies show that PMCA1 expression is greater in tumorigenic MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells compared to non-tumorigenic MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells. Furthermore, the expression of PMCA1b and PMCA4b is lower in human skin and lung fibroblasts neoplastically transformed by simian virus 40, compared to non-transformed counterparts. It is therefore hypothesized that regulation of PMCA isoform expression is disrupted in breast cancer and that inhibition of PMCA expression in an in vitro model of breast cancer has important effects in modulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This thesis describes the use of real time RT-PCR to compare PMCA isoform mRNA expression in tumorigenic and non-tumorigenic mammary gland epithelial cells. It demonstrates that particular breast cancer cell lines overexpress PMCA2, an isoform with restricted tissue distribution and which is present in abundant amounts in the lactating rat mammary gland. Thus, some breast cancers may be characterized by the overexpression of Ca2+ transporters that are normally upregulated during the physiological course of lactation. The pathophysiological significance of PMCA2 overexpression in breast cancer is uncertain and future investigations should look at whether levels of PMCA isoform expression correlate with malignancy, prognosis or survival. To address the second hypothesis of this thesis, a stable MCF-7 Tet-off human breast cancer cell line able to conditionally express PMCA antisense was generated. This strategy was necessary due to the current lack of specific pharmacological inhibitors of the PMCA. This thesis shows that PMCA antisense expression significantly inhibits PMCA protein expression, while subtly affecting PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux without causing cell death. However, it also reveals that inhibition of PMCA expression has major effects in mediating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Moderate changes in PMCA expression and PMCA-mediated Ca2+ transport result in dramatic consequences in MCF-7 cell proliferation. These studies not only support the supposition that modulation of Ca2+ signaling is a viable therapeutic approach for breast cancer but also suggest that PMCAs are possible drug targets. Alternatively, inhibitors of the PMCA may act as adjuvants to augment the efficacy of other anti-neoplastic agents like tamoxifen that have been shown to modulate Ca2+ signaling. Since the discovery of a new family of primary active Ca2+ transporters, which are related to PMCAs, the opportunities in this field of research are very promising.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320504 Toxicology (incl.

By studying agricultural systems as self-generated, hierarchical, complex co-evolutionary farming systems - CCeFSs -, one can investigate the interconnections between the elements that constitute CCeFSs, along with the relationships between CCeFSs and other sytems, as a fundamental step to understanding sustainability as an emergent property of the system. CCeFSs are defined as human activity systems emerging from the purposes, gestalt, mental models, history and weltanschauung of the farm manager, and from his dynamic co-evolution with the environment while managing the resources at his hand to achieve his own multiple, conflicting, dynamic, semi-structured, and often incommensurable and conflicting purposes while performing above thresholds for failure, and enough flexibility to dynamically co-evolve with its changing biophysical and socioeconomic environment for a given future period. Fitness and flexibility are essential features of sustainable CCeFSs because they describe the systems' dynamic capacity to explore and exploit their dynamic phase space while co-evolving with it. This implies that a sustainable CCeFS is conceived as a set of dynamic, co-evolutionary processes, contrasting with the standard view of sustainability as an equilibrium or steady-state. Achieving sustainable CCeFSs is a semi-structured, constrained, multi-objective and dynamic optimisation management problem, with an intractable search space, that can be solved within CCeSA with the help of a multi-objective co-evolutionary optimisation tool. Carnico-ICSPEA2, a co-evolutionary navigator - CoEvoNav -used as a CCeSA's tool for harnessing the complexity of the CCeFS of interest and its environment towards sustainability, is introduced. The software was designed by its end-user - the farm manager and author of this thesis - as an aid for the analysis and optimisation of the San Francisco ranch, a beef cattle enterprise running on temperate pastures and fodder crops in the Central Plateau of Mexico. By combining a non-linear simulator and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a deterministic and stochastic framework, the CoEvoNav imitates the co-evolutionary pattern of the CCeFS of interest. As such, the software was used by the farm manager to navigate through his CCeFS's co-evolutionary phase space towards achieving sustainability at farm level. The ultimate goal was to enhance the farm manager's decision-making process and co-evolutionary skills, through an increased understanding of his system, the co-evolutionary process between his mental models, the CCeFS, and the CoEvoNav, and the continuous discovery of new, improved sets of heuristics. An overview of the methodological, theoretical and philosophical framework of the thesis is introduced. Also, a survey of the Mexican economy, its agricultural sector, and a statistical review of the Mexican beef industry is presented. Concepts such as modern agriculture, the reductionist approach to agricultural research, models, the system's environment, sustainability, conventional and sustainable agriculture, complexity, evolution, simulators, and multi-objective optimisation tools are extensively reviewed. Issues concerning the impossibility of predicting the long-term future behaviour of CCeFSs, along with the use of simulators as decision support tools in the quest for sustainable CCeFSs are discussed. The rationale behind the simulator used for this study, along with that of the multi-objective evolutionary tools used as a makeup of Carnico-ICSPEA2 are explained. A description of the San Francisco ranch, its key on-farm sustainability indicators in the form of objective functions, constraints, and decision variables, and the semi-structured, multi-objective, dynamic, constrained management problem posed by the farm manager's planned introduction of a herd of bulls for fattening as a way to increase the fitness of his CCeFS via a better management of the system's feed surpluses and the acquisition of a new pick-up truck are described as a case study. The tested scenario and the experimental design for the simulations are presented as well. Results from using the CoEvoNav as the farm manager's extended phenotype to solve his multi-objective optimisation problem are described, along with the implications for the management and sustainability of the CCeFS. Finally, the approach and tools developed are evaluated, and the progress made in relation to methodological, theoretical, philosophical and conceptual notions is reviewed along with some future topics for research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230118 Optimisation</field><field name="subject">300901 Farm Management, Rural Management and Agribusiness</field><field name="subject">300903 Sustainable Development</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">co-evolution</field><field name="subject">multi-objective optimisation</field><field name="subject">multi-objective evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">farming systems management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158007</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional planning as good governance: A central Queensland case study</field><field name="creator">Everingham, Jo-Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1605 Policy and Administration</field><field name="subject">Regionalism -- Queensland, Central -- Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158559</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Conventional Sintered Aluminium Powder Alloys</field><field name="creator">Sercombe, Timothy Barry</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to improve the properties of pressed and sintered aluminium powder alloys. This improvement was to be achieved using two methods. The first method involved the selection of an alloy system using binary aluminium phase diagrams and a knowledge of the phase diagram characteristics of ideal sintering systems. The second approach involved the judicious use of selected trace element additions to modify the sintering characteristics of aluminium and its alloys. A trace amount of magnesium was found to be critical to the sintering of aluminium powder due to its disrupting effect on the tenacious oxide layer covering the powder particles. The critical amount of Mg required to optimise both density and mechanical properties is dependent on the specific volume of oxide and the therefore particle size. The optimum concentration is 0.1-1.0wt% Mg. The Al-Sn phase diagram exhibits many of the characteristics of an ideal sintering system. Unsurprisingly, Sn was found to be an extremely efficient sintering aid, but only in the presence of Mg. Near full density parts were produced using an Al-8Sn-0.15Mg alloy in short sintering times (30 minutes). Additionally, as-sintered ductilities exceeding 20% were achieved using an Al-2Sn-0.15Mg alloy. Alloys based on the Al-Sn-Mg system lend themselves to sintering without compaction and therefore freeformed Al-Sn-Mg alloys have been produced and sintered to near full density from a starting density of ~50%. Trace amounts of Sn (Pb, In, Bi, or Sb) enhance the sintering response of an Al-4Cu-0.15Mg alloy via a vacancy binding mechanism. A similar mechanism suppresses natural ageing and stimulates artificial ageing when trace amounts of Sn are added to this alloy. A Sn-modified 2XXX series alloy has also been produced with mechanical properties nearly 20% above current commercial alloys. Along with the addition of 0.1wt%Sn, this improvement required an alteration to the solution treatment cycle which allowed the use of a higher sintering temperature without the formation of large amounts of boundary phase.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291403 Alloy Materials</field><field name="subject">sintering aluminium</field><field name="subject">trace element effects</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157831</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Task Complexity and Cognitive Ability: Relational Complexity in Adult Reasoning</field><field name="creator">Birney, Damian Patrick</field><field name="description">The theory of relational complexity (RC) developed by Halford and his associates (Halford et al., 1998a) proposes that, in addition to the number of unique entities that can be processed in parallel, it is the structure (complexity) of the relations between these entities that most appropriately captures the essence of processing capacity limitations. Halford et al. propose that the relational complexity metric forms an ordinal scale along which both task complexity and an individual&#146;s processing capacity can be ranked. However, the underlying quantitative structure of the RC metric is largely unknown. It is argued that an assessment of the measurement properties of the RC metric is necessary to first demonstrate that the scale is able to rank order task complexity and cognitive capacity in adults. If in addition to ordinal ranking, it can be demonstrated that a continuous monotonic scale underlies the ranking of capacity (the natural extension of the complexity classification), then the potential to improve our understanding of adult cognition is further realised. Using a combination of cognitive psychology and individual differences methodologies, this thesis explores the psychometric properties of RC in three high level reasoning tasks. The Knight-Knave Task and the Sentence Comprehension Task come from the psychological literature. The third task, the Latin Square Task, was developed especially for this project to test the RC theory. An extensive RC analysis of the Knight-Knave Task is conducted using the Method for Analysis of Relational Complexity (MARC). Processing in the Knight-Knave Task has been previously explored using deduction-rules and mental models. We have taken this work as the basis for applying MARC and attempted to model the substantial demands these problems make on limited working memory resources in terms of their relational structure. The RC of the Sentence Comprehension Task has been reported in the literature and we further review and extend the empirically evidence for this task. The primary criterion imposed for developing the Latin Square Task was to minimize confounds that might weaken the identification and interpretation of a RC effect. Factors such as storage load and prior experience were minimized by specifying that the task should be novel, have a small number of general rules that could be mastered quickly by people of differing ages and abilities, and have no rules that are complexity level specific. The strength of MARC lies in using RC to explicitly link the cognitive demand of a task with the capacity of the individual. The cognitive psychology approach predicts performance decrements with increased task complexity and primarily deals with aggregated data across task condition (comparison of means). It is argued however that to minimise the subtle circularity created by validating a task&#146;s complexity using the same information that is used to validate the individual&#146;s processing capacity, an integration of the individual differences approach is necessary. The first major empirical study of the project evaluates the utility of the traditional dual-task approach to analyse the influence of the RC manipulation on the dual-task deficit. The Easy-to-Hard paradigm, a modification of the dual-task methodology, is used to explore the influence of individual differences in processing capacity as a function of RC. The second major empirical study explores the psychometric approach to cognitive complexity. The basic premise is that if RC is a manipulation of cognitive complexity in the traditional psychometric sense, then it should display similar psychometric properties. That is, increasing RC should result in an increasing monotonic relationship between task performance and Fluid Intelligence (Gf) &#150; the complexity-Gf effect. Results from the comparison of means approach indicates that as expected, mean accuracy and response times differed reliably as a function of RC. An interaction between RC and Gf on task performance was also observed. The pattern of correlations was generally not consistent across RC tasks and is qualitatively different in important ways to the complexity-Gf effect. It is concluded that the Latin Square Task has sufficient measurement properties to allows us to discuss (i) how RC differs from complexity in tasks in which expected patterns of correlations are observed, (ii) what additional information needs to be considered to assist with the a priori identification of task characteristics that impose high cognitive demand, and (iii) the implications for understanding reasoning in dynamic and unconstrained environments outside the laboratory. We conclude that relational complexity theory provides a strong foundation from which to explore the influence of individual differences in performance further.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">relational complexity</field><field name="subject">cogntive complexity</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">processing limitations</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157930</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling diffraction in optical interconnects</field><field name="creator">Petrovic, Novak S.</field><field name="description">Short-distance digital communication links, between chips on a circuit board, or between different circuit boards for example, have traditionally been built by using electrical interconnects -- metallic tracks and wires. Recent technological advances have resulted in improvements in the speed of information processing, but have left electrical interconnects intact, thus creating a serious communication problem. Free-space optical interconnects, made up of arrays of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, microlenses, and photodetectors, could be used to solve this problem. If free-space optical interconnects are to successfully replace electrical interconnects, they have to be able to support large rates of information transfer with high channel densities. The biggest obstacle in the way of reaching these requirements is laser beam diffraction. There are three approaches commonly used to model the effects of laser beam diffraction in optical interconnects: one could pursue the path of solving the diffraction integral directly, one could apply stronger approximations with some loss of accuracy of the results, or one could cleverly reinterpret the diffraction problem altogether. None of the representatives of the three categories of existing solutions qualified for our purposes. The main contribution of this dissertation consist of, first, formulating the mode expansion method, and, second, showing that it outperforms all other methods previously used for modelling diffraction in optical interconnects. The mode expansion method allows us to obtain the optical field produced by the diffraction of arbitrary laser beams at empty apertures, phase-shifting optical elements, or any combinations thereof, regardless of the size, shape, position, or any other parameters either of the incident optical field or the observation plane. The mode expansion method enables us to perform all this without any reference or use of the traditional Huygens-Kirchhoff-Fresnel diffraction integrals. When using the mode expansion method, one replaces the incident optical field and the diffracting optical element by an effective beam, possibly containing higher-order transverse modes, so that the ultimate effects of diffraction are equivalently expressed through the complex-valued modal weights. By using the mode expansion method, one represents both the incident and the resultant optical fields in terms of an orthogonal set of functions, and finds the unknown parameters from the condition that the two fields have to be matched at each surface on their propagation paths. Even though essentially a numerical process, the mode expansion method can produce very accurate effective representations of the diffraction fields quickly and efficiently, usually by using no more than about a dozen expanding modes. The second tier of contributions contained in this dissertation is on the subject of the analysis and design of microchannel free-space optical interconnects. In addition to the proper characterisation of the design model, we have formulated several optical interconnect performance parameters, most notably the signal-to-noise ratio, optical carrier-to-noise ratio, and the space-bandwidth product, in a thorough and insightful way that has not been published previously. The proper calculation of those performance parameters, made possible by the mode expansion method, was then performed by using experimentally-measured fields of the incident vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser beams. After illustrating the importance of the proper way of modelling diffraction in optical interconnects, we have shown how to improve the optical interconnect performance by changing either the interconnect optical design, or by careful selection of the design parameter values. We have also suggested a change from the usual `square' to a novel `hexagonal' packing of the optical interconnect channels, in order to alleviate the negative diffraction effects. Finally, the optical interconnect tolerance to lateral misalignment, in the presence of multimodal incident laser beams was studied for the first time, and it was shown to be acceptable only as long as most of the incident optical power is emitted in the fundamental Gaussian mode.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291702 Optical and Photonic Systems</field><field name="subject">700302 Telecommunications</field><field name="subject">free-space optical interconnect</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">modal expansion</field><field name="subject">orthogonal expansion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157988</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Vulnerability-Stress-Coping Model Of Adjustment To The Individual Negative Symptoms Of Schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Watson-Luke, Annette Robyn</field><field name="description">This research program represents the first systematic exploration of the subjective experience of alogia, anhedonia, attention problems, avolition, and emotional blunting, and its relation to other objective and subjective factors in schizophrenia. Using a combined rational-empirical approach, a vulnerability-stress-coping model of adjustment to the 5 negative symptoms was developed and tested. Three aspects of appraisal were examined, the primary appraisals of symptom severity and distress, and the secondary appraisal of control. The dimensions of coping with individual symptoms were initially examined using a rational approach, and then empirically using exploratory factor analyses. The Appraisal and Coping with Negative Symptoms Interview Schedule (ACNSIS) was developed for use in Study 1. Both qualitative and quantitative appraisal and coping data were examined for 20 people with negative symptoms. Responses to the ACNSIS demonstrated that appraisals and coping responses varied across participants and individual negative symptoms. Previously employed categorisations of coping behaviour were used to examine and quantify coping. Negative symptom-specific differences were found in awareness of negative symptom presence, degree of agreement with objective ratings, appraisals, reliance on different types of coping, and relations with participant characteristics. Participant coping responses from Study 1 were used to construct the self-report measure used in subsequent studies. Study 2 involved the development, administration, and evaluation of the selfreport Appraisal and Coping with Negative Symptoms Questionnaire (ACNSQ). Both an electronic and paper version of the ACNSQ were developed. The ACNSQ was administered to 120 people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Participants were required to make severity, distress and control appraisals for each negative symptom they believed they were suffering from. Following symptom appraisals, a number of symptom-specific and general coping items were presented for each negative symptom. In Study 2A, the multidimensionality of coping responses and the nature of empirically derived subscales were explored individually for each negative symptom. Factor analyses of data from 119 participants resulted in 3 underlying coping dimensions for each symptom. These dimensions, which formed the basis of the ACNSQ coping subscales, were labelled as active, emotional, or avoidant forms of coping. Coping subscales were found to be moderately similar across symptoms. The subscales were shown to be internally consistent and largely independent within symptoms. It was found that the degree of reliance on particular coping subscales was negative symptom-specific, although participant coping was related across symptoms. In Study 2B, the nature of negative symptom appraisals and the psychometric properties of the ACNSQ were examined. There was evidence that the nature of appraisals varied according to negative symptom. Retest reliability analyses indicated that overall, ACNSQ appraisals had a low to moderate degree of reliability while coping subscales demonstrated a moderate to high degree of reliability. Differential associations between appraisal and coping and a range of theoretically related variables provided evidence of the construct validity of the ACNSQ. Study 3 used exploratory techniques to conduct cross-sectional tests of a vulnerability-stress-coping model of adjustment to individual negative symptoms based on the data of the 119 participants. Associations between the objective indicator of negative symptom stressor level, and the subjective experience variables of insight, appraisal and coping were examined in relation to adjustment using a multidimensional approach. Two models of the relations between negative symptom predictors and 3 separate domains of adjustment were investigated. Study 3A provided moderate support for a direct effects model for each of the 5 negative symptoms. Objective negative symptom level, insight, primary appraisals and coping subscales all had significant direct effects on one or more domains of adjustment. In general, higher objective negative symptom levels, higher severity and distress appraisals, and greater reliance on avoidant forms of coping were associated with poorer adjustment. The direct effects of active and emotional forms of coping were less consistent and varied across symptoms and adjustment domains. Study 3B extended these findings by providing a limited amount of support for a mediated effects model. Appraisal and coping were found to act as mediators in some of the relations between objective indicators and subjective experience variables for alogia, attention problems and avolition. There was evidence that the impact of insight on coping was partly mediated by control appraisals. Coping partly mediated the relation between stress and adjustment, and appraisal and adjustment. Overall, this series of exploratory studies make a unique contribution to understanding the subjective experience of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The proposed vulnerability-stress-coping model demonstrated utility in identifying variables important in the prediction of adjustment to individual negative symptoms, and in delineating the nature of associations between variables. Further research is required to improve the psychometric properties of the ACNSQ. However, it offers promise as an instrument with which to assess negative symptom appraisals and coping responses, in both clinical and research settings. The present findings have important theoretical and clinical implications concerning the role of subjective and objective factors involved in adjustment to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. This research program provides a valuable foundation for future research to test the vulnerability-stress-coping model in its entirety.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">negative symptoms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158520</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategic approach to mine - mill reconciliation</field><field name="creator">Jansen, W. M.</field><field name="description">Metal accounting systems of mining and processing operations are coming under increasing scrutiny, primarily because of poor agreement between the estimates of mined metal and the quantity of metal actually produced by the concentrator, refiner or smelter. This scrutiny comes in the wake of scandals in the financial accounting world, which has put increased pressure on financial accountants to improve accounting transparency and auditability. This has, in turn, put the onus on metal accountants to examine the quality of their systems, since they form the basis of mining company financial accounts and reports. One weakness that has been identified in the area of metal accounting is a lack of continuity between many mine and mill (processing plant) accounting systems, which often show major discrepancies in production estimates (Baker and Giacomo, 2001). Mine-mill reconciliation is the term applied to the area of comparing, balancing and adjusting production estimates between mine and mill for consistency in reporting, and this thesis seeks to evaluate the concerns in this area and to find robust strategies to ameliorate these concerns. A review of metal accounting and mine-mill reconciliation practices reveals a large number of cultural and technical barriers preventing consistent and high-quality mine-mill reconciliation practice. Current measurement technologies and mathematical/statistical techniques available to the mining industry were also reviewed, and it is clear that application of these underutilised tools has the potential to vastly improve the quality and usefulness of mine-mill production measurement and accounting. Thus, in addition to the benefit of better accounting standards compliance, significant operational improvements may be realised through application of many of these tools and techniques. The approach used to achieve the thesis objectives is to collate a wide variety of available tools and techniques (along with some novel techniques developed) into a practical framework/strategy for undertaking mine-mill accounting and reconciliation. This approach is based on the notion that knowledge of measurement sources and uncertainty (error) is essential to control and improve production efficiency of the overall operation (as opposed to individual areas within). As such, a conceptual approach to mine-mill reconciliation is first proposed, which addresses many of the problem areas identified in the review. A detailed, step-by-step methodology applicable to most metal mining operations is then expanded from this framework, illustrated through a fictitious operation. This methodology is divided into two main parts, consisting of a metal accounting site survey followed by the metal balancing, reconciliation and reporting process. One element of particular importance in this process is ore tracking through process hold-ups, and some approaches to examining this issue are discussed in detail and demonstrated. The proposed mine-mill metal accounting and reconciliation methodology was applied to two very different case studies, Northparkes Mines (NPM) and Potgietersrust Platinums Limited (PPRust). The NPM case study showed application of the entire methodology to a mining and processing operation. For PPRust, only particular elements of the methodology were applied to exhibit the flexibility of the methodology and demonstrate its application through example. The product of this methodology is a practical, yet still somewhat conceptual, methodology that can be applied to most metal mining operations in order to maximise the potential of their mine-mill accounting and reconciliation. The strategy proposed has uncovered a number of significant implications to the mining industry, such as: &#8226; Better understanding of the sources of and uncertainty in production estimates can lead to better system control, system auditability and reporting integrity, which should elevate operational credibility in the eyes of mining company financial accountants, analysts and stakeholders at a &#8220;license to operate&#8221; level. &#8226; Dissolving the traditional mine-mill boundary and focussing on best utilising the most accurate and precise production information over the entire operation provides an improved basis for operational decision making and economic calculations. &#8226; Using an ore tracking system that can link mill production measurements of in-process ore back to its original location in the deposit can provide a robust means of evaluating mine production efficiency, of evaluating mine model performance and, potentially, of updating reported reserve estimates based on statistically sound information. Though this work does not represent a complete solution to mine-mill reconciliation, it provides strong conceptual goals and a solid technical foundation for future work in this area.</field><field

physical activity, a large proportion of older adults are insufficiently active. In New Zealand, the Green Prescription is the nationwide physical activity scripting programme. The Green Prescription has been found to be effective in increasing physical activity in previously low-active and sedentary adults. However, more information is required about the efficacy of Green Prescription use with older adults. The present research examined participants' views and experiences of physical activity counseling via the conventional Green Prescription and a modified pedometer-based Green Prescription. Both versions of the Green Prescription were effective in increasing and maintaining physical activity over a 12-month period.

Two possible solutions have been identified. These are guided wave and vibration analysis. This research focuses on vibration analysis method, based on variation in the natural frequencies and/or damping ratios caused by blockages. Experimental simulation studies the performance to assess the viability of the vibration analysis method in identifying blockage in the cyclone. To test this method, a 1.87m long vertical cylindrical steel tube with both ends simply supported was setup as a prototype and flour was used as the powder conveyed by the tube. Analytical, numerical and experimental methods were implemented on the prototype using vibration analysis techniques. Experimental resonant frequencies of the empty shell from the impact hammer excitation were compared with analytical and numerical solutions to analyse the modal shapes. The first bending mode was determined as 79 Hz, which decreased with the amount of added mass and location closer to the middle point. This was validated by the simulated mass experiment, which also matched with the beam-mass theory. Flour induced experiment further validated the variation of the first bending mode. Experimental 270Hz, 380Hz and 398Hz resonant frequencies increased with the amount of added mass, which was validated by the simulated mass and flour induced experiment. Besides the variation of the natural frequencies, the damping ratio was also studied and quantified using the Hilbert transform envelope curve method. Onsite monitoring of the vibration of the cyclone in a spray dryer was done at Fonterra Te Rapa and clear resonant frequencies were obtained. The research results from the prototype demonstrate that vibration analysis as a non-destructive method to detect the milk powder deposition or blockage in the cyclone is possible and promising. However, more work is required before industry application.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration analysis</field><field name="subject">Non-destructive testing (NDT)</field><field name="subject">Milk powder blockage</field><field name="subject">Spray dryer</field><field name="subject">Natural frequency</field><field name="subject">Damping ratio</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/997</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What are the economic and travel implications of pedestrianising a roadway in Takapuna&#8217;s shopping precinct</field><field name="creator">Wooller, Leslie Ann</field><field name="description">Transforming car-oriented streets into functional public spaces and pedestrianised environments have typically been undervalued in conventional transportation, planning, and health literature. Yet urban regeneration initiatives have the potential to create environments that support active transport (e.g., walking and cycling), social interaction, and economic development. There is very little evidence-based research, however, around pedestrianisation. Few international studies have examined the association between pedestrianisation with health, social and economic outcomes from a stakeholder perspective, and there was a dearth of evidence in the New Zealand context. Limited knowledge also existed regarding the similarities and differences in attitudes toward pedestrianisation for key stakeholders, and how this impacted on the urban planning process. As such, the aims of this thesis were to determine: 1) who the users were, how they travelled, and how much money they spent in the Takapuna shopping precinct; 2) how the spending habits and travel behaviours of adult shoppers may be influenced by pedestrianisation in Takapuna&#8217;s shopping precinct; and 3) the shopper, retailer, and local government attitudes and behaviours toward pedestrianisation in Takapuna&#8217;s shopping precinct. A comprehensive literature review formed the theoretical framework for the following two research chapters (Study 1 and 2), where data was gathered from face-to-face surveys and semi-structured interviews using adults drawn from the Takapuna shopping precinct. In Study 1, a total of 325 shoppers and 62 retailers participated in a cross-sectional survey between May and June 2009. The majority of shoppers accessed the shopping precinct by motorised transport (65.8%). The main finding of this study is although median spend per trip was similar for shoppers across all transport modes ($20.00 per trip), those who actively transported to the shopping precinct visited the area more frequently than shoppers who travelled by automobile (median 12 versus 6 trips per month, respectively; p-value = 0.032). This resulted in shoppers using active transport modes spending more money in total than shoppers who travelled to the precinct by motorised transport. Shoppers reported a more negative perception of the shopping precinct when compared with retailers&#8217; perceptions. Retailers&#8217; perceptions of shopper mode of transport to the area, perceptions of traffic flow, and pedestrian access were similar to those reported by shoppers. Subsequent changes to the urban environment that support the increased use of active transport modes may enhance economic development through increased purchasing frequency and provide public health benefits through greater accumulation of physical activity. Study 2 investigated the perceived benefits of pedestrianising the shopping precinct in Takapuna, Auckland with key stakeholders. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine stakeholders drawn from three groups: shoppers, retailers, and local government. Shoppers and retailers perceived pedestrianisation schemes as a way of improving aesthetics, connectivity and accessibility, safety, public transport infrastructure, and walking and cycling levels within the area. Retailers were concerned about the impact of short-term construction on retail revenue. Local government respondents realised the potential of pedestrianising the area to improve existing infrastructure and to become more economically competitive with other nearby retail options. All stakeholders recognised the importance and benefit of securing collaborative input into urban regeneration schemes, and identified that the initiatives must be considered within a long-term cohesive strategic framework. This research adds to the growing body of urban regeneration research by identifying associations with physical activity and economic outcomes, and substantially contributes to the knowledge base within the New Zealand context. The evidence presented in this thesis supports that changes to the urban environment that support pedestrianisation in shopping precincts will likely provide long-term benefits, namely greater economic spend within the area and opportunities to accumulate physical activity.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedestrianisation</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">urban regeneration</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">stakeholder perceptions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/999</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate disclosures of related-party relationships and transactions in China: agency, governance, legitimacy and signalling influences</field><field name="creator">Shan, Yuan George</field><field name="description">This study examines empirically whether ownership structure and board composition, political costs and media agenda setting, and proprietary costs influenced the related-party disclosures of Chinese listed companies during 2001 to 2005.

This would require a re-conceptualisation of the "objects" of their knowledge domain, the entities and phenomena which comprise it, and the relationships between these entities (with particular reference to the concept of "information" itself). The term "information" is used in a multitude of contexts in the so called "Information Society", and this overuse has undermined the disciplinary and professional position of the information professions: the site of information work is contested. Furthermore, the changing context of the Information Society has challenged and diminished the essential task of the information professions: to deal with society's information problems and needs, as distinguished from the provision of information and communication technologies. In addition, access to information itself is contested as it is increasingly mediated by technology. The aim of this work is to develop a conceptual model by stabilising the defining concepts and constructs of information work, so that the social objectives and praxis of the field are elucidated and supported.

However while screening is routine for conditions such as impaired glucose control, obstetric care providers are often reluctant to intervene with substance use, citing knowledge deficits and a lack of effective screening tools. General negativity about the value of intervention and stereotypical views of substance users have also been identified. This study examined existing screening tools and investigated the World Health Organization&#8217;s ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test) Version 3.0, focussed on tobacco, alcohol and cannabis, the substances most used in the targetted public hospital clinics. The ASSIST Version 3.0&#8217;s performance in pregnancy was assessed using a two-pronged harm categorization: risk to the fetus and risk to the woman as an individual user. For the latter, levels of risk concordant with cut-offs for the general population were utilized. The ASSIST Version 3.0 performed only moderately well versus established self-report tools: the Revised Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (RTQ) for tobacco, the T-ACE for alcohol, and the Timeline FollowBack (TLFB) for cannabis. Most participants used tobacco (98 of 104); predominance of tobacco use was likely linked to the recognized difficulty in stopping, despite cessation of other substances. Kappa analyses of Specific Substance Involvement Scores (SSIS) on ASSIST Version 3.0 for tobacco did not support changing cut-offs for the woman as an individual user; however, ROC curves delineated an SSIS of 4 as indicative of fetal risk for both alcohol and cannabis. As all 98 tobacco users were &#8216;high risk&#8217; users, a cut-off indicative of fetal risk for tobacco could not be determined but may be feasible by further research with first trimester women. Identifying tobacco use with an established tobacco-specific tool should be the first screening for pregnant women. If tobacco use is identified, screening for other substance use can be initiated and there may be a place for the ASSIST Version 3.0 in that context. Obstetric care providers need to then be willing and competent to address identified use, whilst avoiding unhelpful stereotyping.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">substance use; pregnancy; screening</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60650</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatially fixed and moving virtual sensing methods for active noise control.</field><field name="creator">Moreau, Danielle J.</field><field name="description">Local active noise control systems generate a zone of quiet at the physical error sensor location. While significant attenuation is achieved at the error sensor, local noise control is not without its problems, chiefly that the zone of quiet is generally small and impractically sized. It may be inconvenient to place the error sensor at the desired location of attenuation, such as near an observer&#8217;s ear, preventing the small zone of quiet from being centered there. To overcome the problems encountered in local active noise control, virtual acoustic sensors have been developed to shift the zone of quiet away from the physical sensor position to a spatially fixed desired location. The general aim of the research presented in this thesis is to improve and extend the spatially fixed and moving virtual sensing algorithms developed for active noise control thus far and hence increase the scope and application of local active noise control systems. To achieve this research aim, a number of novel spatially fixed and moving virtual sensing algorithms are presented for local active noise control. In this thesis, a spatially fixed virtual sensing technique named the Stochastically Optimal Tonal Diffuse Field (SOTDF) virtual sensing method is developed specifically for use in pure tone diffuse sound fields. The SOTDF virtual sensing method is a fixed gain virtual sensing method that does not require a preliminary identification stage nor models of the complex transfer functions between the error sensors and the sources. SOTDF virtual microphones and virtual energy density sensors that use both pressure and pressure gradient sensors are developed using the SOTDF virtual sensing method. The performance of these SOTDF virtual sensors is investigated in numerical simulations and using experimental measurements made in a reverberation chamber. SOTDF virtual sensors are shown to accurately estimate the pressure and pressure gradient at a virtual location and to effectively shift the zone of quiet away from the physical sensors to the virtual location. In numerically simulated and post-processed experimental control, both virtual microphones and virtual energy density sensors achieve higher attenuation at the virtual location than conventional control strategies employing their physical counterpart. As it is likely that the desired location of attenuation is not spatially fixed, a number of moving virtual sensing algorithms are also developed in this thesis. These moving virtual sensing algorithms generate a virtual microphone that tracks the desired location of attenuation as it moves through a three-dimensional sound field. To determine the level of attenuation that can be expected at the ear of a seated observer in practice, the performance of the moving virtual sensing algorithms in generating a moving zone of quiet at the single ear of a rotating artificial head is investigated in real-time experiments conducted in a modally dense three dimensional cavity. Results of real-time experiments demonstrate that moving virtual sensors provide improved attenuation at the moving virtual location compared to either fixed virtual sensors or fixed physical sensors. As an acoustic energy density cost function spatially extends the zone of quiet generated at the sensor location, a fixed three-dimensional virtual acoustic energy density sensing method is also developed for use in a modally dense three-dimensional sound field. The size of the localised zone of quiet achieved by minimising either the acoustic energy density or the squared pressure at the virtual location with the active noise control system is compared in real-time experiments conduced in a modally dense three-dimensional cavity. Experimental results demonstrate that minimising the virtual acoustic energy density provides improved attenuation in the sound field and a larger 10 dB zone of quiet at the virtual location than virtual microphones.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active noise control; virtual sensing; acoustic energy density</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60651</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotrophoblast differentiation in the first trimester of human pregnancy</field><field name="creator">James, Joanna</field><field name="description">In the first trimester of human pregnancy specialised placental cells, termed cytotrophoblasts differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which grow out from the placenta and invade into the maternal decidua, acting to physically attach the placenta to the decidua, and adapt the uterine spiral arteries to support pregnancy. A proportion of these EVTs also temporarily occlude the spiral arteries for approximately the first 10 weeks of gestation, preventing maternal blood flow to the placenta and creating a low oxygen environment in which placental and fetal development occur. The processes of trophoblast outgrowth and invasion, and the establishment of a low oxygen environment, are essential for the success of pregnancy, and inadequate trophoblast invasion into the uterus has been associated with recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, the exact mechanisms that control the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts down the extravillous trophoblast lineage are poorly understood. Since the extent of this invasive process is unique to human implantation, animal models are of limited value in studying trophoblast invasion. Existing in vitro models have major limitations in that many are very difficult to quantify while others many not study the correct trophoblast population. The research in this thesis has focussed on the development of novel models by which to study cytotrophoblast differentiation, and the use of these models to further understand cytotrophoblast differentiation down the EVT lineage, and the regulation of EVT outgrowth by oxygen. Methods Outgrowth from first trimester villous explants was characterized using immunohistochemistry. Explant viability was investigated using dual staining with chloromethylfluorescin diacetate (CMFDA) and ethidium bromide, by examining DNA laddering, and by immunostaining sectioned explants over 96 hours of culture. The extended viability of cytotrophoblasts in multilayered cell islands in villous tips was exploited to isolate these cells using sequential trypsin digests of cultured villous explants. The trophoblast population obtained were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Finally, villous explants were cultured in either 1.5% or 8% oxygen and the frequency and area of outgrowths was quantified in order to determine the effect of gestation and oxygen on EVT outgrowth. Results Approximately 1/4 of explants cultured in 20% oxygen produced EVT outgrowth. Outgrowth formation and expansion resulted from proliferation of cells in the tips of anchoring villi, and EVTs within the outgrowth did not proliferate. The percentage of explants producing outgrowth declined as gestation increased from 8 to 12 weeks. Dual staining with CMFDA and ethidium bromide revealed degeneration of the syncytiotrophoblast by non-apoptotic mechanisms within 4 hours of culture, but this syncytiotrophoblast layer was able to be regenerated. The majority of cytotrophoblasts died within one week of culture, but despite this explants were able to produce EVT outgrowth for up to 3 weeks due to the extended survival of a specific set of cytotrophoblasts located in cell islands in the tips of anchoring villi. These surviving cells were able to differentiate into EVTs, but not regenerate the surrounding syncytiotrophoblast in the villus tip. Trypsinization of first trimester villi after extended explant culture resulted in the isolation of a viable population of &#8216;putative EVT progenitors&#8217; that did not syncytialise in culture, but were able to proliferate. 20% of these cells differentiated down the EVT lineage within 96 hours of culture. The putative EVT progenitors expressed markers previously localised to cytotrophoblasts in cell islands of anchoring villi, including &#945;v&#946;6 integrin and FGFR-2. The addition of exogenous FGF-4 did not affect the differentiation of these cells into EVTs, nor did FGF-4 alter the frequency of EVT outgrowth from explants. Culture in 1.5% oxygen significantly reduced the frequency and area of outgrowths in comparison to 8% oxygen. HLA-G and &#945;1 integrin were both expressed throughout outgrowths with no difference in expression of these proteins between oxygen concentrations. Gestation influenced the response of explants to oxygen, with a significant differential response to oxygen concentration in placentae under 11 weeks of gestation but no differential response in placentae of 11 or 12 weeks. Conclusions In the first trimester, oxygen and gestational age regulate extravillous trophoblast outgrowth in both an independent and interdependent manner. The cytotrophoblast population in the first trimester does not consist of one homogenous bipotent population. Rather there are at least two separate populations: 1) EVT progenitors that exist in the tips of potential anchoring villi that are likely to be committed to EVT differentiation and 2) monolayer villous cytotrophoblasts which are likely to be committed to syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The second population is easily isolated by traditional enzymatic digestion methods whereas the first much smaller population can be isolated by exploiting their prolonged survival in explant culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2607</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life history and demography of the pipi, Paphies australis (Bivalvia: Mesodesmatidae) in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hooker, Simon Holloway.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the life history characteristics of the New Zealand pipi (Paphies australis) from gametogenesis, through spawning, larval development, settlement, juvenile recruitment patterns, distribution and abundance patterns, population size structure and growth characteristics from the Whangateau Harbour, in northeastern New Zealand. The thesis concludes by integrating this information into a model, based on hydrographic information and post settlement movement in order to help explain the observed patterns of distribution and abundance of juvenile and adult pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. The temporal pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was investigated over two years (May 1991 - April 1993). Samples of pipi gonads were processed using standard histological techniques, and the resultant sections placed into six developmental categories (early active, late active, mature, partially spawned and indeterminate). Gametogenesis was similar in both years, beginning in autumn with most pi pi in early active stages of development. By late winter many pipi were mature. Spawning commenced in early spring and continued through spring and summer. From a sample of 104 pi pi collected in spring 1992 for investigation into the length at sexual maturity, all pipi were found to be sexually mature above 40 mm shell length, but some individuals between 30-40 mm also had gonads with sex cells present. This sample had a sex ratio significantly biased towards females. Further analysis revealed that juveniles (below 40 mm shell length) had a significantly higher proportion of females than males, but adults (above 40 mm shell length) had a sex ratio of approximately 1: 1. No evidence of hermaphroditism was observed. The spatial pattern of the reproductive cycle of pipi was also investigated over one year (February 1992 to January 1993) at three subtidal sites using the same techniques as for the temporal study, but with one further category (parasitised). The reproductive cycle was similar between sites, with an extended spawning period . of late winter to summer. It was concluded that the reproductive cycle of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour was synchronised at all three sites sampled. A visual maturity index gave the same overall pattern of reproductive cycle as the histological analysis, but was found to be inaccurate mainly due to a poor recognition of the mature stages. It was concluded that the visual index was of limited value in accurately assessing the maturity of an individual. The sex ratio of adult pipi was not significantly different from 1: 1. A small percentage (0.87%) of pi pi were infected by a digenetic trematode fluke that, in most cases, totally castrated the individual. The larval development of pipi was described from larval culture experiments. Pi pi were conditioned, spawned and the resultant larvae reared to settlement in the laboratory. Adult pipi were successfully conditioned after 23 days at 22&#176;C. Spawning was accomplished using a combination of increased temperature and a dilute sperm solution. Settlement occurred 18-22 days after spawning at a mean shell length of 264 Ilm . After settlement and metamorphosis pi pi gradually began to take on the adult shape. Cultured juveniles were grown to 37 mm shell length both in the laboratory and later in the wild. Once in the wild, cultured pipi grew from 13 mm to 37 mm in 17 months with a strong seasonal component to their growth. Microscopic examination revealed slight differences in shell morphology between pi pi larvae and the closely related tuatua (Paphies subtriangu/ata) and toheroa (Paphies ventricosa). Pi pi were more rounded and smaller than both tuatua and toheroa at a similar stage of development. The results of scanning electron microscope examination of larval shell hinge structure confirmed previous preliminary findings for pipi. The larval shell ligament is posterior to the centre of the provinculum in pipi but central in both the tuatua and toheroa. These differences are sufficient to enable larval pipi to be distinguished from larval toheroa and tuatua. The spatial and temporal patterns of distribution and abundance of pipi were measured from November 1991 to January 1994. Previous information had suggested that pipi were a mainly intertidal species, but this study found that they can occur in large numbers subtidally. Temporal sampling was carried out by systematically measuring the abundance of pipi found within three subtidal grids. Abundances were compared within and between the grids. The subtidal population was extremely dense (up to 4400 m-2 ), with well defined boundaries. Pipi densities at the edges of the beds dropped from many hundreds to zero m-2 within 2 to 3 m. Large numbers of juvenile pi pi &#171;30 mm) were present at the start of sampling and the density of these decreased during the sampling period. Juvenile pipi occurred at high density at the harbour entrance site, but were rare or absent at the other two sites further up the harbour. Small scale distribution (ie. within a grid) at the harbour entrance showed high variability which was linked to large swells from storms, observed only at this site. The advantages of systematic sampling compared with random or haphazard sampling are discussed. The population size structure, growth and small scale movement patterns of pipi, were also studied. Pi pi formed a continuous bed from the harbour entrance up the main subtidal channel, and extended approximately one kilometre upstream. Pi pi had different shell morphologies at different sites within the harbour, and population size structure differed among sites. Small pi pi were found at either end of the subtidal pi pi bed but were absent from the middle. Analysis of length-frequency distributions indicated that there had been a large recruitment of pipi prior to the commencement of the study, but little further recruitment occurred during 1992 to 1994. Pipi took approximately three to four years to reach the population maximum size of 55-60 mm shell length. Tagged pipi, constrained in suspended nets grew more slowly than predicted from population length-frequency analysis, but tagged pi pi that were returned to the sediment grew as predicted. Localised movement of tagged pipi showed that pi pi gradually move into the centre (deeper part) of the channel and towards the harbour entrance. Adult and juvenile pipi, were observed drifting in mid-water, in the Whangateau Harbour. The animals were buoyed up by the secretion of long mucus threads which extended out through their siphons. Quantitative information from netting experiments over a period of five months from May 1993 to September 1993, collected a total of 509 drifting pipi. These were mainly juveniles &#171;15 mm shell length) but a small number of adults (up to 58 mm shell length) were also collected. The numbers of pi pi caught was highly variable, however, there was a trend for more drifting pipi to be caught on the flood tide (n=386) than the ebb tide (n=123). Overall there was little difference in the number of pipi caught between spring (n=263) and neap tides (n=246), however, this was heavily influenced by one neap tide in May 1993 (n=207). Three other bivalve species (So/etellina sp, Gari stangeri, Macomona . lilliana) were also caught drifting. Pipi were also observed to attach themselves to debris, such as dead branches of trees, which then moved them with the tidal currents. Large epiphytic algal growths on the shell also acted to buoy individuals which moved them around in tidal currents. It is hypothesised that mucus drifting in pipi is an active process, adopted for movement to other areas triggered by very high densities (over 4000 m2 ) in the harbour entrance. Finally, the distribution and size structure of the pi pi population was described by a simple model, based on the post-settlement movement of pi pi and tidal current patterns. Pipi recruits &#171;5 mm shell length) were found to be largely restricted to a small strip, mid-intertidally in clean coarse sediments. Juvenile pi pi (5-35 mm) were found at a low intertidal site directly downstream of the recruitment site. Further downstream of this site, at a subtidal site at the harbour entrance both juvenile and adult pi pi were found. A similar population size structure was found at the innermost extent of the pi pi bed in the main channel. Adult pi pi were abundant in the central part of the pi pi bed, but no juveniles were found at this site. It was concluded that post-settlement movement patterns could account for the distribution patterns of pipi in the Whangateau Harbour. If subsequently found to be of more general applicability, this model provides a powerful, predictive tool for managing pipi population and possibly other infaunal clams. This study provides, for the first time, a detailed description of the distribution and abundance of an entire pipi population from one harbour. This information allows a more informed management of pi pi populations around New Zealand. It also provides a framework in which more indepth questions about the ecology of pipi populations (and other bivalve populations) can be more clearly addressed.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5758</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing a defence of insanity: the role of forensic psychiatrists</field><field name="creator">Thom, Katey</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the role of forensic psychiatrists as expert witnesses in criminal trials using the insanity defence in New Zealand. It relies on data generated through qualitative research methods and provides thick descriptions&#8216; of how the role works in practice as forensic psychiatrists, together with the instructing lawyers, construct the defence. Multiple data sources were accessed, including thirty-one interviews with lawyers and forensic psychiatrists, observation of a high profile criminal case, and interpretation of clinical and legal texts. The research extends the existing medico-legal literature that has studied the relationship between psychiatry and law and provides analysis which contributes to current debates around the use of psychiatric expertise in cases of insanity. Drawing on contemporary socio-legal studies, the research focuses on the hybrid nature of the insanity defence, the hybrid expertise forensic psychiatrists&#8216; practise as expert witnesses, and the symbiotic relationship between lawyers and forensic psychiatrists that occurs in this context. This thesis argues that the insanity defence is a hybrid construct that brings lawyers and forensic psychiatrists together in such a way that the boundaries, which should ideally define their discrete functions, become blurred. The way the insanity defence shapes forensic psychiatrists&#8216; practices, and the relationship between lawyers and forensic psychiatrists, is also explored. The forensic psychiatrists&#8216; practices are shown to be inextricably linked to the legal requirements for an expert witness and the defence of insanity. From this perspective, the forensic psychiatrists are not &#8213;doing psychiatry&#8214; as they would in a therapeutic setting, but rather they practise a hybridised expertise that reflects the hybrid nature of the insanity defence. The symbiotic relationship that occurs in practice as lawyers and psychiatrists make a case for insanity is demonstrated. This implicates lawyers in the production of effective expert testimony and illustrates how the defence of insanity is co-produced by both professionals in the courtroom. This thesis highlights how the boundaries that aim to separate the responsibilities of forensic psychiatrists, lawyers and fact-finders become blurred in practice. It contends that these findings have significant implications for not only the continued use of forensic psychiatrists in cases of insanity, but also public understandings of madnes</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5898</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the health human resource development provisions of the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Master of Public Policy, Massey University at Albany</field><field name="creator">Tiongco-Cruda, Beatriz</field><field name="description">Republic Act No. 9173, or the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 enunciates a bevy of incentives under its Health Human Resource Production, Utilization and Development provisions, intended to stem the rising tide of Filipino nurses leaving the country to work overseas. Under Sections 30 to 34 of the Nursing Act, these incentives include the following: (1) upgrading the minimum base salary of nurses from salary grade 10 to 15; (2) establishing a nurse specialty program in government hospitals to upgrade the nurses&#8217; skills whereby recipients of the program are required to work in government hospitals for two years; and (3) the provision of other benefits such as scholarship grants, free medical care, etc. These provisions are the government&#8217;s policy response to mitigate the impact of nurses&#8217; migration and retain an adequate supply of skilled Filipino nurses in the country: This research is a qualitative study that seeks to assess the health human resource development provisions and their implementation and aims to help improve them. This study examines the responsiveness of the provisions to the needs of nurses, and identifies the deficiencies of the provisions by looking into the working conditions of nurses in two Philippine government hospitals. It also examines the processes and the factors affecting the implementation of the provisions. This study employed a combination of four data collection methods: (1) focus group interviews of nurses working in two Philippine government hospitals, (2) key informant interviews of officials of government agencies and private organizations tasked to implement the health human resource development provisions, (3) document analyses, and (4) researcher&#8217;s field notes/journal. The researcher conducted five focus group interviews with a total of 15 nurse participants and 12 key informant interviews.  The nurses are working under conditions of low salaries and heavy workload, that is characterized by low nurse-to-patient ratios in the National and LGU Hospitals. The problems of inadequate nurse staffing, large number iii of patients and inadequate supplies in the two government hospitals are identified as causes for the heavy workload of nurses. The nurses want a salary increase that is commensurate to their heavy workload, their professional qualifications and long years of service. For the nurses, a salary increase signifies the government&#8217;s recognition of their dedication, hard work, and commitment to provide health care to Filipinos despite working under dire circumstances. The nurse specialty training program in areas such as oncology, nephrology, critical care, etc. has not been implemented because of the limited capacities of government hospitals to provide this kind of training and the lack of regulatory framework for the practice of nurse specialists in the Philippines. The other benefits have not been implemented as well. The provisions of the Nursing Act are deficient because they do not address the causes of the heavy workload of nurses. To improve the work conditions of nurses, the Philippine government needs to prioritize to the long neglected health sector by increasing the budgetary allocation in order to create more nurse positions in government hospitals, to provide adequate supplies and equipment for government hospitals and to improve the facilities for nurses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filipino nurses</field><field name="subject">government hospitals</field><field name="subject">nurses' working conditions</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/870</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Un i form "consisting of one" : a written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clement, Julie</field><field name="description">Uni form is an exploration into the act of getting dressed.

What emerges from this research is a proposal that a uni form &#8211; a metaphoric garment &#8211; can meet the needs of everyday life in the postmodern urban metropolis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dress</field><field name="subject">personal identity</field><field name="subject">social identity</field><field name="subject">wardrobe</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::419900 Other Arts::419999 The arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1035</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of polyphenolic blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) extracts for the potential to modulate allergic airway inflammation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Nutritional Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Janet Lynley</field><field name="description">The allergic disease of asthma is characterized by an infiltration of inflammatory cells to the lung, a process co-ordinated by T-helper (TH) cells. The TH2 cytokine Interleukin (IL)-4 promotes infiltration of eosinophils to sites of inflammation. Eosinophil-selective chemoattractant cytokines (eg. eotaxins) are synthesized by lung epithelial cells. Eotaxin-3 is expressed at high levels in the asthmatic lung, predominantly after IL-4 stimulation. Eotaxin-3 is therefore a marker of inappropriate airway inflammation. Polyphenolic (PP) compounds found in high concentrations in berries may have beneficial effects in inflammatory conditions. Plant and Food Research produced high-PP extracts of blackcurrant (BC) cultivars that were tested for inflammation modulating effects. Since high doses of PPs have been shown to cause cell death, we tested two BC cultivars at a range of concentrations in a cell viability (WST-1) assay. While no toxic effects were attributable to the BC extracts (1-50&#181;g/ml), a dose-related trend in cell death was observed and therefore 10&#181;g/ml was chosen for further experiments Ten BC cultivars were compared for efficacy by measuring eotaxin-3 production in IL-4 stimulated human lung epithelial (A549) cells in vitro. Cells were incubated with BC extracts (10&#181;g/ml) and IL-4 (10ng/ml) for 24 hours. The supernatants were then quantified for eotaxin-3 levels by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All ten BC extracts reduced eotaxin-3 levels after stimulation with IL-4, and six BC extracts were effective by statistically significant levels (P&lt;0.05), (BC cultivars -01, -02, -03, -05, -09 &amp; -10). Of those, BC extracts of four cultivars demonstrated a reduction of more than 65% from the IL-4 stimulated control. In addition, a positive trend in inflammation modulation vs. one anthocyanin (ACN) in the BC extracts was shown. This study has demonstrated the beneficial inflammation modulatory effects of polyphenolic BC extracts, which could be related to cyanidin 3-O-rutinoside content. These results may have therapeutic potential for asthma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blackcurrant</field><field name="subject">European black currant</field><field name="subject">Ribes nigrum</field><field name="subject">polyphenols</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">airway (medicine) inflammation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1212</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The human myostatin precursor protein : structure, function and amyloid formation : implications for the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Starck, Carlene Sheree</field><field name="description">Myostatin is a major player in the regulation of mammalian muscle growth and development, maintaining the balance between proliferation and differentiation prenatally and the quiescence of satellite cells in adults. An absence or overexpression of myostatin results in double-muscling and cachexia respectively, placing myostatin as a promising target in the treatment of muscle wastage diseases. As a transforming growth factor-&#946; superfamily member, myostatin is produced as a precursor protein, consisting of a propeptide region N-terminal to the growth factor domain. Cleavage of the precursor between the domains forms the myostatin latent complex, an inhibitory structure which is exported from the cell where a second cleavage event releases the active myostatin growth factor. The precursor protein, propeptide, and latent complex play important roles in the regulation of myostatin. However, their structure and function are poorly understood, and a possible role for the myostatin precursor protein in the muscle wastage disease sporadic inclusion body myositis, suggests that pre-growth factor forms of myostatin may be additional important therapeutic targets. This thesis presents an investigation into the structure and function of the myostatin precursor protein, the latent complex, and the propeptide region within these, with comparisons to a mutant form of myostatin responsible for the naturally-occurring double-muscled phenotype of the Piedmontese cattle breed. Results suggest that the diverse functions of the propeptide region are facilitated by regions of intrinsic disorder within a primarily structured domain, and that conformational alterations accompany the precursor to latent complex transition, resulting in a tighter inhibitory structure. Comparative analyses between the wild-type and mutant proteins suggest that the Piedmontese phenotype is due to a reduced capacity for covalent dimerisation and significant structural alterations within the type I receptor-binding domain. Investigation into misfolded myostatin precursor protein found that the precursor is able to form cytotoxic amyloid aggregates and mature fibrils under partially denaturing conditions, suggesting a possible mechanism for the role of the myostatin precursor in sporadic inclusion body myositis. Together, these novel results contribute important information towards an understanding of myostatin structure, function and regulation in both normal and disease scenarios.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myostatin precursor protein</field><field name="subject">Muscle wastage disease</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1408</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A table of metaphors : the visual representation of chronic illness : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gibbons, Ruth Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">For people who live with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity syndrome illness is a hidden construct. The body does not display the chronicity of the internal experience. This thesis removes the barrier between what is experienced and what is visible by creating visual means of communicating the body&#8217;s hidden experience. The place of the viewer is part of this discussion. Through visual methods digital photographic techniques and the current interest in sensory anthropology the embodied sensory chronic illness experience is explored. The hidden experiences were made visual creating &#8220;MeBoxes&#8221; and masks which showed both the external and embodied internal experiences of chronic illness. As the process of working with and walking beside the participants developed, I found that the discourse on imaging within the literature was inadequate to show the real lived experiences of those with chronic illness. My interactions with the people of this thesis and the process of honouring their experiences required a model that would encourage the viewer to new and perhaps unrealised depths of participation to understand the participant&#8217;s multi-faceted and multi-layered experiences. Part of the discussion is the ability of images to communicate sensory experience as is the case with Munch&#8217;s The Scream and Picasso&#8217;s Guernica.

The experiences of ESL students as they complete a clinical placement are examined and compared with data from the students&#8223; clinical lecturers and preceptors. Data for the study was collected through interviews with individual students before, during and after their Transition to Practice placement. Interviews were also held with two of the students&#8223; preceptors, and a focus group was held with clinical lecturers who had experience of working with ESL students. Results from the study underline the importance of facilitating students&#8223; entry to the placement community of practice, and access to its interactions. A number of factors supported or inhibited students&#8223; participation and learning within the placement community. The study identified two critical factors intrinsic to the student, and two extrinsic to the student. Intrinsic factors included the student&#8223;s proficiency with English language: in particular, the sophisticated sociopragmatic language skills used by nurses in their daily interactions. The student&#8223;s use of learning strategies, including the proactive approach best suited to learning on placement, was also critical. Extrinsic factors likely to support the student&#8223;s integration within the community of practice were the quality of the preceptor, in terms of attitude to and training for the preceptoring role, and the tone of the placement environment. The major outcomes of this study point to the importance of providing direct instruction for ESL students in the kinds of language and learning styles required for placement. There are also implications for the selection and training of preceptors and for the placing of students in appropriate clinical environments. The study concludes with suggestions for a specific communication programme for ESL students.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing training</field><field name="subject">Language skills</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1661</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">e-Process selection using decision making methods : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Albertyn, Erina Francina</field><field name="description">The key objective of this research is to develop a selection methodology that can be used to support and aid the selection of development processes for e-Commerce Information Systems (eCIS) effectively using various decision methods. The selection methodology supports developers in their choice of an e-Commerce Information System Development Process (e-Process) by providing them with a few different decision making methods for choosing between defined e-Processes using a set of quality aspects to compare and evaluate the different options. The methodology also provides historical data of previous selections that can be used to further support their specific choice. The research was initiated by the fast growing Information Technology environment, where e-Commerce Information Systems is a relatively new development area and developers of these systems may be using new development methods and have difficulty deciding on the best suited process to use when developing new eCIS. These developers also need documentary support for their choices and this research helps them with these decision-making processes. The e-Process Selection Methodology allows for the comparison of existing development processes as well as the comparison of processes as defined by the developers. Four different decision making methods, the Value-Benefit Method (Weighted Scoring), the Analytical Hierarchy Process, Case-Based Reasoning and a Social Choice method are used to solve the problem of selecting among e-Commerce Development Methodologies. The Value-Benefit Method, when applied to the selection of an e-Process from a set of e-Processes, uses multiple quality aspects. Values are assigned to each aspect for each of the e-Processes by experts. The importance of each of the aspects, to the eCIS, is defined in terms of weights. The selected e-Process is the one with the highest score when the values and weights are multiplied and then summed. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is used to quantify a selection of quality aspects and then these are used to evaluate alternative e-Processes and thus determining the best matching solution to the problem. This process provides for the ranking and determining of the relative worth of each of the quality aspects. Case-Based Reasoning requires the capturing of the resulting knowledge of previous cases, in a knowledge base, in order to make a decision. The case database is built in such a way that the concrete factual knowledge of previous individual cases that were solved previously is stored and can be used in the decision process. Case-based reasoning is used to determine the best choices. This allows the user to either use the selection methodology or the case base database to resolve their problems or both. Social Choice Methods are based on voting processes. Individuals vote for their preferences from a set of e-Processes. The results are aggregated to obtain a final result that indicates which e-Process is the preferred one. The e-Process Selection Methodology is demonstrated and validated by the development of a prototype tool. This tool can be used to select the most suitable solution for a case at hand. The thesis includes the factors that motivated the research and the process that was followed. The e-Process Selection Methodology is summarised as well as the strengths and weaknesses discussed. The contribution to knowledge is explained and future developments are proposed. To conclude, the lessons learnt and reinforced are considered.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-Commerce information system</field><field name="subject">Development processes</field><field name="subject">Case-based selection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280112 Information systems development methodologies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1662</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment and teachers in transition : assessment innovation in Japan in the context of English language education</field><field name="creator">Yamaguchi, Hiroko</field><field name="description">In recent years, assessment policies and practices in language teaching programs worldwide have been changing in a number of ways at both system and classroom levels. To improve efficiency and effectiveness, some countries have introduced standardised tests and others have introduced outcome-based approaches which use teacher-conducted assessments as a basis for reporting learners&#8217; progress and achievement against system-wide or national standards. It is particularly worth noting that assessment is currently moving away from the use of standardised multiple-choice tests to more complex performance-based assessments. This paradigm shift has led to changes in assessment approaches from a norm-referenced grading to a criterion-referenced grading. Japan is one of a number of countries that has introduced a criterion-referenced approach to assessment. This research case study investigates a criterion-referenced assessment system implemented in 2004 for English at lower secondary schools in Japan. The study examines the perceptions held by English teachers about the new assessment system, the way the assessment has impacted on their practices and the basis of their decisions about assessing students&#8217; achievement. Data sources include policy documents, teacher questionnaires, interviews with teachers and non-teaching educators, and teaching and assessment materials. These data are examined using a qualitative and interpretive approach. The study focuses on the assessment implementation process itself and on the subsequent changes that need to be further adapted by the teachers as they enact the new policies. It defines the kind of support teachers need in order to practice consistent and valid assessment. The conclusions from the study support the findings of other similar studies and suggest that changing one component on its own can not bring about a change. The findings suggest that it is important that a proposed innovation ensures the harmonious relationship amongst key components such as curriculum/syllabus, teaching materials, and examinations, and is grounded in local experience and educational realities in order to prevent conflict situations arising. They suggest that it is necessary to take time to develop a good understanding of key concepts embedded in the innovation, to examine teacher factors such as their beliefs and teaching practice, and to provide teachers with ongoing professional development, in the process of implementing the innovation. The study concludes with recommendations for a successful implementation of a new assessment system, and with a reflection on the bilingual research process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criterion-referenced tests.</field><field name="subject">Curriculum-based assessment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1123</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social capital and social entrepreneurship : Analysing links and implications for sustainability in third sector organisations in West Bengal</field><field name="creator">Basu, Saswati</field><field name="description">The theory of social capital attracts considerable attention across diversified fields due to its positive impact on society. A major portion of social capital literature is devoted to defining the concept and identifying the sources and factors that contribute to social capital development. Putnam (1993), the major proponent of this theory, defined social capital as the trust, norms and networks that facilitate coordinated action and improve the efficiency of society. He considered voluntary organisations to be a significant source of social capital as they encourage the trust-based relationships required for collective action. Many authors argued that social capital development is context specific. Krishna (2002) found that in a poor socio-economic context, social entrepreneurs acting as mediators can activate social capital and bring development. Social entrepreneurs act as catalysts to social change (Alvord et al. 2004), but limited studies have focused on their role in voluntary organisations in developing social capital. The present research analyses the activities of social entrepreneurs who assist in building and strengthening social capital among villagers as a part of the development process, and the implications of these activities for organisational sustainability. The activities of two types of social entrepreneurs, outsiders (SEETOs) and insiders (non- SEETOs) have been analysed. The research used a qualitative design and case study approach to investigate multiple levels of analysis within the single study. The case study organisations are five rural voluntary organisations from the state of West Bengal, India &#8212; three with SEETOs and two with non-SEETOs. Primary data have been collected during 2007 and 2008 through face-to-face interviews, published materials, photographs and participant observations. The findings of this research indicate that the development of social capital is dependent on the &#8216;enabling&#8217; leadership style of social entrepreneurs. The &#8216;enabling&#8217; leaders played an important role in transforming an organisation into a learning organisation and developed the villagers&#8217; organisational ability or social agency (an element of social capital) as a group to solve their own problems. The learning organisation ensures organisational sustainability. The study also observed the &#8216;benevolent dictator&#8217; leadership style. The &#8216;benevolent dictator&#8217; failed to create a learning organisation, and so the villagers had no organizational ability or social agency, which then placed organisational sustainability at risk. However, both types of leader played positive and effective roles in improving the lives of poor villagers. The research confirmed the social entrepreneur&#8217;s role in social capital development in voluntary organisations within a poor socio-economic context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1126</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vibration-based damage identification methods for civil engineering structures using artificial neural networks</field><field name="creator">Dackermann, Ulrike</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the viability of using dynamic-based &#8216;damage fingerprints&#8217; in combination with artificial neural network (ANN) techniques and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify defects in civil engineering structures. Vibration-based damage detection techniques are global methods and are based on the principle that damage alters both the physical properties, such as mass, stiffness and damping, as well as the dynamic properties of a structure. It is therefore feasible to utilise measured dynamic quantities, such as time histories, frequency response functions (FRFs) and modal parameters, from structural vibration to detect damage. Damage identification based on vibrational characteristics is essentially a form of pattern recognition problem, which looks for the discrimination between two or more signal categories, e.g., before and after a structure is damaged, or differences in damage levels or locations. Artificial neural networks are capable of pattern recognition, classification, signal processing and system identification, and are therefore an ideal tool in complementing dynamic-based damage detection techniques. Likewise, PCA has pattern recognition abilities and is capable of data reduction and noise filtering. With these characteristics, both techniques can help overcome limitations associated with previously developed vibration-based methods and assist in delivering more accurate and robust damage identification results. In this study, two types of dynamic-based damage identification methods are proposed. The first is based on the damage index (DI) method (initially proposed by Stubbs et al.), while the second approach uses changes in FRF data as damage fingerprints. The advantage of using damage patterns from the DI method, which is based on changes in modal strain energies, is that only measured mode shapes are required in the damage identification, without having to know the complete stiffness and mass matrices of the structure. The use of directly measured FRF data, which provide an abundance of information, is further beneficial as the execution of experimental modal analysis is not required, thus greatly reducing human induced errors. Both proposed methods utilise PCA and neural network techniques for damage feature extraction, data reduction and noise filtering. A hierarchical network training scheme based on network ensembles is proposed to take advantage of individual characteristics of damage patterns obtained from different sources (different vibrational modes for the DI-based method and different sensor locations for the FRF-based method). In the ensemble, a number of individual networks are trained in parallel, which optimises the network training and delivers improved damage identification outcomes. Both methods are first tested on a simple beam structure to assess their feasibility and performance. Then, the FRF-based method is applied to a more complicated structure, a two-storey framed structure, for validation purposes. The two methods are verified by numerical simulations and laboratory testing for both structures. As defects, notch type damage of different severities and locations are investigated for the beam structure. For the two-storey framed structure, three different types of structural change are studied, i.e. boundary damage, added mass changes and section reduction damage. To simulate field-testing conditions, the issue of limited sensor availability is incorporated into the analysis. For the DI-based method, sensor network limitations are compensated for by refining coarse mode shape vectors using cubic spline interpolation techniques. To simulate noise disturbances experienced during experimental testing, for the numerical simulations, measurement data are polluted with different levels of white Gaussian noise. The damage identifications of both methods are found to be accurate and reliable for all types of damage. For the DI-based method, the results show that the proposed method is capable of overcoming limitations of the original DI method associated with node point singularities and sensitivities to limited number of sensors. For the FRF-based method, excellent results are obtained for damage identification of the beam structure as well as of the two-storey framed structure. A major contribution is the training of the neural networks in a network ensemble scheme, which operates as a filtering mechanism against individual networks with poor performance. The ensemble network, which fuses results of individual networks, gives results that are in general better than the outcomes of any of the individual networks. Further, the noise filtering capabilities of PCA and neural networks demonstrate great performance in the proposed methods, especially for the FRF-based identification scheme.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial neural networks.</field><field name="subject">Frequency-response (Dynamics)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1127</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moments over the solution space of the travelling salesman problem</field><field name="creator">Sutcliffe, Paul</field><field name="description">In this thesis we consider the statistical properties of the symmetric travelling salesman problem (TSP). Previous work on the statistical properties of the problem has been largely limited to the Euclidean case with vertex coordinates as random variables with known distribution embedded in Rd, and to the case of independent identically distributed random edge costs. Furthermore, this previous work did not extend to computing the moments, beyond the mean. In the work presented here we consider the more general case of problem instances specified as a set of edge costs and with no (known) embedding or coordinate system available. For an instance of the problem on n vertices with fixed edge costs we give constructive proofs that the population variance of tour costs over the solution space can be computed in O(n2), the third central moment can be computed in O(n4) and the fourth central moment can be computed in O(n6). These results provide direct methods to compute the moments about the origin and factorial moments of these orders with the corresponding computational complexity. In addition the results provide tractable methods to compute, among other statistics, the standard deviation of tour costs, the skewness of the probability distributions of tour costs over the solution space and kurtosis of this distribution. In the case of the stochastic TSP with edge costs defined as independently distributed random variables with (not necessarily identical) known mean and variance we provide a O(n4) algorithm to compute the variance of tour costs. Given a subgraph S of a tour in an n city TSP, we provide an O(n2) algorithm to compute the expected tour costs over the solution space of those tours containing S. This is useful in analysing and constructing algorithms such as Gutin's greedy expectation heuristic. We demonstrate that the probability distribution of gains over the 2-opt landscape of an n city TSP can be computed in O(n4 log(n)). This result provides a tractable algorithm to compute, among other statistics the moments of gains over the landscape. The result also provides the 2-opt neutrality (the number of neighbouring solutions with identical cost) of a instance. The result has natural generalisation to the 3-opt landscape (at higher computational complexity). We relate the variance of tour costs over the solution space to that of the gains over the 2-opt landscape of a problem, providing an O(n2) method to compute the variance of gains over the landscape. We apply our method to compute the low order moments of the distribution of tour costs to several empirical studies of the solution space. Among other results we: con&#175;rm the known relationship between the standard deviation of tour costs and the optimal tour cost; we show a correlation between the skewness and the optimal tour cost; we demonstrate that the moments can be used to estimate the complete probability distribution of tour costs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Combinatorial analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1128</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the teaching of drama : school-based, needs-driven professional learning</field><field name="creator">Perry, Rachel</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how the teaching of drama can be enhanced through needs-driven, school-based professional learning. It was motivated by a personal &#8216;living contradiction&#8217;, involving the frustration that can result when beliefs and actions do not correspond. My learning journey continued through literature searches and preliminary work with teachers that resulted in an effective process of professional learning with five teachers. The research design draws on elements of action research, situated, and action learning theories, to develop a process of &#8216;facilitated action research&#8217;. Informed, but not limited by existing models of action research, this collaborative process was responsive to teacher preferences in addressing the three research aims. Evolving over two phases with eleven teachers, the bulk of the study followed the stories of five teachers and their professional learning. Data collection tools included the use of semi-structured interviews, conversations, a questionnaire, survey and reflective journals. The findings demonstrated that professional learning, responsive to context and self-identified needs, positively enhanced the teaching of drama. Teacher confidence and awareness of drama gradually increased, as did teacher ability to self-direct learning. Areas of skill development, integration and time management were initially identified as a focus for professional learning, with classroom and behaviour management added as school-based issues arose. Establishing a &#8216;common understanding of drama&#8217; was acknowledged as critical for effective collaborative learning to take place. Personal factors including confidence, experience and belief, and the contextual factors of parental expectation, outcomes, time, space and past professional learning were found to facilitate or constrain drama use. The research found that professional learning, characterised by a respect for past experiences, assisted in the creation of a &#8216;safe space&#8217; for learning. Tailoring professional learning to needs and the school context was also found to motivate teachers and was effective in enhancing the teaching of drama.

Health services constitute one of the most fundamental of social organisations, so with this change, has come a need for nurses to provide relevant and appropriate care to the multiplicity of peoples who now live in contemporary social communities. Providing appropriate nursing care today is demanding new skills of nurses and to ensure that they can meet this demand, new knowledge and understanding is required. To do this well, constitutes one of the greatest contemporary challenges facing nursing. The aim of this study was to identify and analyse the theories and models of nursing that hold authority on and guide cross-cultural care giving in nursing. The thesis underlying this study was to respond to the question - when nurses have had access to cultural care theory and its related literature for some 30 years, why has this not, as yet, had a significant impact on nursing? The intent being to explore the genesis and development of the knowledge used to underpin cross-cultural care in nursing and by doing so assist nurses to better understand, in the fullest sense, the meanings that are being created and conveyed. To achieve this, a qualitative methodology was employed to make possible the description and interpretation of existing theory with a critical approach being taken towards that text. Understanding and unmasking the theory revealed both overt and covert beliefs and ideas intrinsic to the discourse, which have the potential to shape and configure nurses&#8217; attitudes, opinions and perspectives. This research has considered, explored and analysed contemporary theories of cross-cultural nursing to provide clarification and enhance the capacity of nurses to gain a fuller understanding of cross-cultural care. It offers new insights into the viewpoints being advanced and opens up fresh possibilities for the development of a deeper understanding of Western scholarship on culture in nursing. The findings also identify areas for continued inquiry, which if focused upon and developed into the future, could contribute to improvements in nursing and greater understanding of the complex domain of cross-cultural care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transcultural nursing.</field><field name="subject">Cultural awareness.</field><field name="subject">Nurse and patient.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1130</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A criminalistic approach to biological evidence : trace DNA and volume crime offences</field><field name="creator">Raymond, Jennifer Joan</field><field name="description">Volume crimes such as burglary and street robbery present an enormous cost to the Australian community each year. These ubiquitous crimes traditionally have a low resolution rate, but the use of information gathered through DNA databases provides another avenue of investigation. The forensic response to these crimes could be increased with the use of trace DNA; however the lack of awareness of forensic science as a holistic discipline focusing on the study of traces, often leads to a lack of knowledge into the trace evidence characteristics of DNA. This problem is compounded by practical and interpretive difficulties. The main hypothesis tested through this study is that, with an increased understanding into the criminalistic properties of trace DNA, it may prove to be more useful and effective evidence in the investigation of volume crime than is currently the case. The project encompassed three parts. The first component was a detailed survey sent to every jurisdiction in Australia and New Zealand to benchmark methods and protocols, education and training of personnel, and opinions and uses of trace DNA. The second involved the analysis of the results of 250 trace DNA swabs collected from New South Wales crime scenes, in order to provide a comparison point to the experimental work. The final section comprised preliminary experimental work to investigate the abundance, transfer and persistence of trace DNA within the context of residential burglary and street robbery offences. The methods survey helped to identify methods to be used in the experimental component of the project, but also highlighted issues in the field including a lack of training and proficiency testing. The absence of data collation across the jurisdictions was also a point for concern, and prevented the identification of factors that may affect trace DNA success rates. The pervading outcome of the survey was the need for effective data management systems and strong communication lines to facilitate best practice. From the analysis of the casework data a success rate in the order of 15- 20% was identified for New South Wales trace DNA swabs, with an average of 1.7ng of DNA recovered. Subsets of the data were used to directly compare to the experimental results in terms of transfer and persistence.  The experimental work gave an insight into the behaviour of trace DNA in crime scene scenarios. The level of background DNA on surfaces encountered in forensic investigations was varied; for example residential doors were found to hold more background DNA than windows. Whilst the level of DNA on personal items such as bags and wallets was found to be relatively high, DNA from the offenders of simulated robberies could still be detected in usable quantities on these items. DNA was found to persist in sheltered locations for at least six weeks,but declined more rapidly in outdoor environments, with profiles not recovered after two weeks. This information may help to assist the interpretation and presentation of trace DNA evidence when the judicial question is one of activity, rather than source. The data also may be used in the education of crime scene examiners to assist them to target the most probative evidential samples. With further work in this field, trace DNA will be more easily applied to investigations. Trace DNA may be a useful tool in volume crime investigations, but individual jurisdictions should assess their capacity to manage the evidence to ensure results can be disseminated and actioned in a timely manner, otherwise the  investment  may prove to be fruitless. Effective and ongoing training programs and functional data management systems should be implemented to maximise both the investigative and intelligence value of trace DNA evidence. A holistic approach to the implementation of forensic evidence, encompassing the groundwork of theoretical analysis, review of capabilities and logistical and technical improvements, would greatly increase its value in policing and the criminal justice system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA data banks.</field><field name="subject">Forensic sciences.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1131</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bi-level decision making with fuzzy sets and particle swarm optimisation</field><field name="creator">Gao, Ya</field><field name="description">Bi-level programming techniques are developed for decentralized decision problems with decision makers located in a two-level decision making system; the upper decision maker is termed the leader while the lower is the follower. Both the leader and the follower try to optimise their own objective functions and the corresponding decisions do not control but do affect those of the other level. This research aims at solving bi-level decision problems with five extensions, i.e. multiple leaders/followers/objectives, fuzzy coefficients and goals. By using particle swarm optimisation and/or cut set and/or goal programming and/or Nash equilibrium concept, related mathematical models and corresponding algorithms are developed to solve fuzzy linear bi-level decision problems, fuzzy linear multi-objective bi-level decision problems, fuzzy linear multi-follower multi-objective bi-level decision problems, fuzzy linear goal bi-level decision problems, multi-leader one-follower bi-level decision problems, one-leader multi-follower bi-level decision problems, and multileader multi-follower bi-level decision problems. A fuzzy bi-level decision support system is then developed which implements all the algorithms to support bi-level decision making with different features. Finally, by using these bi-level models and algorithms, we explore possible applications in the fields of railway train set organisation, railway wagon flow management, strategic bidding in the electricity market, and supply chains to solve real world bi-level decision problems. The results of experiments show that the models and algorithms are effective for solving real world bi-level decision problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision making.</field><field name="subject">Multiple criteria decision making.</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy decision making.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1132</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Intercropping and Double Cropping in Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peter Michael Masasso</field><field name="description">The potential for relay intercropping and double cropping was assessed in field trials over three consecutive years at Gatton, Queensland. The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microbial ecology of equine laminitis of alimentary origin</field><field name="creator">Milinovich, Gabriel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equine, laminitis, hindgut, microbiology, microbial ecology, Streptococcus, oligofructose.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159339</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations to plant root growth in highly saline and alkaline bauxite residue</field><field name="creator">Kopittke, Peter Martin</field><field name="description">Revegetation of bauxite residue is hampered by a lack of understanding of the limitations imposed on plant growth in highly saline and alkaline growth mediums. In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal concept analysis applications to requirements engineering and design</field><field name="creator">Tilley, Thomas Alan</field><field name="description">Currently, the bulk of applications of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) in software engineering have focussed on software maintenance and re-engineering. In this thesis we broaden the approach by applying FCA to a number of early-phase activities within the software engineering life-cycle. With respect to the requirements engineering phase, a case study is presented comparing two class hierarchies that model aspects of a mass-transit railway ticketing system. The first hierarchy was produced for an existing Object-Z specification of the system while the second was derived using FCA. Contrasting the two hierarchies revealed that they were essentially the same, however, the differences highlighted specification artefacts in the existing hierarchy. With respect to the design phase, the thesis discusses the use of FCA for the navigation and visualisation of Formal Specifications written in Z. In response to the continued call for formal methods tool support, we implement and explore a prototype specification browser that exploits the abstractions afforded by FCA. The research hypothesis is an integrated architecture for navigating formal specifications using FCA. This architecture is realised using ZML and ToscanaJ to produce a practical research tool. The thesis also includes the first broad survey of FCA in the domain of software engineering and an FCA-based methodology for surveying academic literature in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280111 Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">formal concept analysis</field><field name="subject">requirements analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">formal specification</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157991</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responding to International Terrorism: The Contribution of the United Nations</field><field name="creator">Emma Kennedy Da Silva</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">united nations, international terrorism, multilateralism, unilateralism, international relations, cooperation, institutions, security</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159349</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Centre Sites: The New Gatekeepers of the Web?</field><field name="creator">Bruns, Axel</field><field name="description">This thesis introduces and analyses the emerging Website genre of Resource Centre Sites. RCSs are sites which combine news, rumours and background information as well as community discussion and commentary on their chosen topic, and frequently serve as a first point of entry for readers interested in learning more about the field. They also offer spaces for virtual communities of specialists or enthusiasts to emerge, who in the process and as a product of their interaction on these sites collate detailed resource collections and hyperlink directories for their fields of interest. Therefore, Resource Centre Sites significantly involve their users as content contributors and producers, turning them into what is here termed &#145;produsers&#146; of the site. Aiming to evaluate all the content relevant to their field that is becoming available online, and to coopt or at least link to this information from the news and resources collection that is a central part of the RCS, Resource Centre Site produsers engage in an adaptation of both traditional journalistic gatekeeping methodologies and librarianly resource collection approaches to the Web environment: in the absence of gates to keep online, they have become &#145;gatewatchers&#146;, observing the publication of news and information in other sources and publicising its existence through their own sites. Their operation is studied here through a number of case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites from various fields of interest. These sites are analysed both based on their available Web content, and using background information obtained in a series of email interviews with RCS creators. In combination, this offers insights into the operating philosophies of sites and site editors, and provides an opportunity to assess to what extent these ideas have been translated into everyday practice. Chapter 1 provides an overview of past and current theoretical views of the Web in an effort to evaluate their suitability for the current study. Older approaches positing an abstract &#145;ideal&#146; form of hypertext are rejected in favour of a direct engagement with the World Wide Web as the now dominant mode of hypertextuality. Chapter 2 outlines the principles of gatewatching in contrast to traditional methods of evaluating news and information as they exist in journalistic media and archival institutions, and investigates the effects such gatewatching practices may have on editors and users. Chapter 3 describes the overall characteristics of Resource Centre Sites as a genre of Web publications. It notes the special role site users play in the operation of such sites (in their new role as &#145;produsers&#146;), and distinguishes the RCS genre from similar Website models such as portals and cybermediaries. Chapter 4 observes the everyday operation of such Websites in practice, using case studies of major existing Resource Centre Sites including Slashdot, MediaChannel and CountingDown, and interviews with their creators. (These interviews are included in full in the Appendix.) This analysis works with both a synchronic view to the variety of topics existing Resource Centre Sites are able to address, and a diachronic view to the evolution of proto-RCSs (such as enthusiast community or online advocacy sites) into fully-featured Resource Centre Sites. Finally, based on this analysis, Chapter 5 is then able to point out some of the implications and effects that increasing use of this media form may have on its users and the network of news and information publications on- and offline, and to indicate the potential for further developments of the site genre.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">751004 The media</field><field name="subject">420399 Cultural Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Web</field><field name="subject">World Wide Web</field><field name="subject">WWW</field><field name="subject">hypertext</field><field name="subject">hypermedia</field><field name="subject">online</field><field name="subject">online publishing</field><field name="subject">online communities</field><field name="subject">virtual</field><field name="subject">virtual communities</field><field name="subject">open source</field><field name="subject">Resource Centre Sites</field><field name="subject">RCS</field><field name="subject">RCSs</field><field name="subject">gatekeeping</field><field name="subject">gatewatching</field><field name="subject">produsers</field><field name="subject">portals</field><field name="subject">virtual settlements</field><field name="subject">online journalism</field><field name="subject">MediaChannel</field><field name="subject">HIV InSite</field><field name="subject">GameGirlz</field><field name="subject">GrrlGamer</field><field name="subject">Womengamers</field><field name="subject">Countingdown.com</field><field name="subject">Slashdot</field><field name="subject">Amiga.org</field><field name="subject">Slashcode</field><field name="subject">PHP-Nuke</field><field name="subject">Postnuke</field><field name="subject">Axel Bruns</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157907</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies in the rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions</field><field name="creator">Thackeray, Vincent Gregory</field><field name="description">Government intervention in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The merits review system is an integral part of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the merits review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for merits review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law merits review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for merits review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the merits review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1,070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for merits review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for merits review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for merits review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of merits review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="subject">Inconsistencies</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">merits</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">administrative</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Executive</field><field name="subject">unaccountable</field><field name="subject">Parliament</field><field name="subject">injustice</field><field name="subject">empirical</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">statutes</field><field name="subject">legislation. breakdown</field><field name="subject">legislative</field><field name="subject">drafting</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary</field><field name="subject">Counsel</field><field name="subject">Administrative</field><field name="subject">Review</field><field name="subject">Tribunal</field><field name="subject">Council</field><field name="subject">Attorney-General</field><field name="subject">appeal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157885</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a method of digital computer simulation of the flotation process by means of a mathematical model</field><field name="creator">Bull, W.

Under favourable conditions, certain cyanobacteria can dominate the phytoplankton within a waterbody and form nuisance blooms. Case reports and anecdotal references dating from 1949 describe a range of illnesses associated with recreational exposure to cyanobacteria: hay fever-like symptoms, pruritic skin rashes and gastro-intestinal symptoms (the latter probably related to ingestion of water) are most frequently reported. Some papers give convincing descriptions of allergic responses to cyanobacteria; others describe more serious acute illnesses, with symptoms such as severe headache, pneumonia, fever, myalgia, vertigo and blistering in the mouth. A U.S. coroner recently found that a teenage boy died as a result of accidentally ingesting a neurotoxic cyanotoxin from a golf course pond; this is the first recorded human fatality attributed to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria. One of the main public health concerns with exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria relates to the understanding that some blooms produce toxins that specifically affect the liver or the central nervous system. The route of exposure for these toxins is oral, from accidental or deliberate ingestion of recreational water, and possibly by inhalation. Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are also reported to be putative cutaneous, gastrointestinal, respiratory and pyrogenic toxins. The aims of this project were to enhance the understanding of public health issues relating to recreational exposure to cyanobacteria by conducting epidemiological and laboratory-based toxicology studies. A prospective cohort study of 1,331 recreational water users was conducted at various sites in southern Queensland, the Myall Lakes area of New South Wales, and central Florida. The study design sought to make improvements over previously published epidemiological studies, in that an unexposed group was recruited from cyanobacteria-free waters, cyanobacterial toxins were measured in site water samples, and respondents were asked to rate the severity of reported symptoms. This study has shown an increased likelihood of symptom reporting amongst bathers exposed to high cyanobacterial cell density (measured by total cell surface area) compared to those exposed to low cyanobacteria-affected waters. Mild respiratory symptoms appear to be the predominant symptom category. A clinical dermatology study to examine delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions to cyanobacterial extracts was conducted. The study groups were 20 patients presenting for diagnostic skin patch testing at the Royal Brisbane Hospital's dermatology outpatient clinic; a convenience sample of 20 individuals was recruited from outside the hospital as a control group. One patient developed unequivocal reactions to several cyanobacteria extracts, with no dose-response pattern seen, indicating that the reactions were allergic in nature. A mouse model of delayed-contact hypersensitivity, the mouse ear swelling test, has demonstrated that the purified toxin cylindrospermopsin, a highly water-soluble compound, is capable of producing cutaneous injury. Encrusting lesions were seen on abdominal skin during the induction phase of these experiments. Delayed-contact hypersensitivity reactions were also demonstrated with this toxin. LPS from two non-axenic cyanobacterial samples - Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa - were extracted and purified. Thermoregulation studies were performed using a mouse model of rectal temperature measurement. Separate groups of mice were injected with these LPS extracts at two dose levels. Thermoregulation studies were also conducted with purified cyanobacterial toxins: microcystin-LR and cylindrospermopsin and anatoxin-a; cyanobacterial LPS samples purified by collaborators in Adelaide were also investigated for thermoregulation potential. These experiments have shown that the LPS extracts are weakly active when compared with responses to much lower doses of Escherichia coli LPS. Cylindrospermopsin also produces hypothermic responses in mice - comparable to pyrexia in larger mammals - although at a later stage than was seen with LPS extracts. Supplementing the experimental observations of the toxicology and immunotoxicology of cyanobacterial LPS are insights gained from beyond the cyanobacteria literature on the mechanisms of toxicity of different LPS structures. Cyanobacterial LPS was initially suggested to be toxic in the 1970s, at a time when lipid A, the active moiety of LPS, was thought to be identical across all Gram-negative bacteria. More recent work raises questions about the attribution of cutaneous and gastrointestinal illness to cyanobacterial LPS, with the understanding that some bacterial lipid A structures are LPS antagonists, LPS is not toxic by the oral route, and LPS is not reported as a toxin in the clinical dermatology literature. Gut-derived lipopolysaccharides, however, exert potent synergistic effects with a variety of xenobiotic hepatotoxins, and the well-known shock-like syndromes associated with severe cylindrospermopsin and microcystin poisoning deserve further scrutiny from the perspective of immunotoxicology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321201 Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety</field><field name="subject">321299 Public Health and Health Services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">730210 Environmental health</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">blue-green algae</field><field name="subject">epidemiology</field><field name="subject">health effects</field><field name="subject">recreational</field><field name="subject">freshwater</field><field name="subject">recreational water</field><field name="subject">skin</field><field name="subject">cutaneous</field><field name="subject">lipopolysaccharide</field><field name="subject">thermoregulation</field><field name="subject">immunotoxicology</field><field name="subject">innate immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9880</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentological record of the Late Palaeozoic Gondwanan Glaciation in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Jones, A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260104 Sedimentology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:107012</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular events in hedgehog signalling: Regulation by vesicular trafficking and sterols</field><field name="creator">Evans, T.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:107267</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Food practices and food safety during Ramadan in ChumChon Muslim, Hat Yai, Southern Thailand</field><field name="creator">Subhajalat, C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321205 Nutrition and Dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105513</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specificity and reliability of measures of the EEG power spectrum</field><field name="creator">Hooper, G.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growing a sense of place: Storythread and the transformation of a school</field><field name="creator">Tooth, Ronald Clifford</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational change</field><field name="subject">School management and organization</field><field name="subject">School improvement programs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158500</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From river banks to shearing sheds: Thirty years with flying arts 1971 - 2001</field><field name="creator">England, Marilyn Irene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1905 Visual Arts and Crafts</field><field name="subject">Moriarty, Mervyn, 1937-</field><field name="subject">Flying Arts -- History.</field><field name="subject">Art schools -- Queensland -- History -- 20th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158697</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of stakeholder power on a destination branding process: The Gold Coast VeryGC brand</field><field name="creator">Marzano, Giuseppe</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place marketing</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Marketing</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast (Qld.)</field><field name="subject">Power</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder</field><field name="subject">Destination branding</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158722</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring and modelling threats to koala populations in rapidly urbanising landscapes: Koala coast, south east Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Preece, Harriet Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Koala -- Ecology -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Habitat -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158435</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional planning as good governance: A central Queensland case study</field><field name="creator">Everingham, Jo-Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1605 Policy and Administration</field><field name="subject">Regionalism -- Queensland, Central -- Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158559</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Measurement of Task Complexity and Cognitive Ability: Relational Complexity in Adult Reasoning</field><field name="creator">Birney, Damian Patrick</field><field name="description">The theory of relational complexity (RC) developed by Halford and his associates (Halford et al., 1998a) proposes that, in addition to the number of unique entities that can be processed in parallel, it is the structure (complexity) of the relations between these entities that most appropriately captures the essence of processing capacity limitations. Halford et al. propose that the relational complexity metric forms an ordinal scale along which both task complexity and an individual&#146;s processing capacity can be ranked. However, the underlying quantitative structure of the RC metric is largely unknown. It is argued that an assessment of the measurement properties of the RC metric is necessary to first demonstrate that the scale is able to rank order task complexity and cognitive capacity in adults. If in addition to ordinal ranking, it can be demonstrated that a continuous monotonic scale underlies the ranking of capacity (the natural extension of the complexity classification), then the potential to improve our understanding of adult cognition is further realised. Using a combination of cognitive psychology and individual differences methodologies, this thesis explores the psychometric properties of RC in three high level reasoning tasks. The Knight-Knave Task and the Sentence Comprehension Task come from the psychological literature. The third task, the Latin Square Task, was developed especially for this project to test the RC theory. An extensive RC analysis of the Knight-Knave Task is conducted using the Method for Analysis of Relational Complexity (MARC). Processing in the Knight-Knave Task has been previously explored using deduction-rules and mental models. We have taken this work as the basis for applying MARC and attempted to model the substantial demands these problems make on limited working memory resources in terms of their relational structure. The RC of the Sentence Comprehension Task has been reported in the literature and we further review and extend the empirically evidence for this task. The primary criterion imposed for developing the Latin Square Task was to minimize confounds that might weaken the identification and interpretation of a RC effect. Factors such as storage load and prior experience were minimized by specifying that the task should be novel, have a small number of general rules that could be mastered quickly by people of differing ages and abilities, and have no rules that are complexity level specific. The strength of MARC lies in using RC to explicitly link the cognitive demand of a task with the capacity of the individual. The cognitive psychology approach predicts performance decrements with increased task complexity and primarily deals with aggregated data across task condition (comparison of means). It is argued however that to minimise the subtle circularity created by validating a task&#146;s complexity using the same information that is used to validate the individual&#146;s processing capacity, an integration of the individual differences approach is necessary. The first major empirical study of the project evaluates the utility of the traditional dual-task approach to analyse the influence of the RC manipulation on the dual-task deficit. The Easy-to-Hard paradigm, a modification of the dual-task methodology, is used to explore the influence of individual differences in processing capacity as a function of RC. The second major empirical study explores the psychometric approach to cognitive complexity. The basic premise is that if RC is a manipulation of cognitive complexity in the traditional psychometric sense, then it should display similar psychometric properties. That is, increasing RC should result in an increasing monotonic relationship between task performance and Fluid Intelligence (Gf) &#150; the complexity-Gf effect. Results from the comparison of means approach indicates that as expected, mean accuracy and response times differed reliably as a function of RC. An interaction between RC and Gf on task performance was also observed. The pattern of correlations was generally not consistent across RC tasks and is qualitatively different in important ways to the complexity-Gf effect. It is concluded that the Latin Square Task has sufficient measurement properties to allows us to discuss (i) how RC differs from complexity in tasks in which expected patterns of correlations are observed, (ii) what additional information needs to be considered to assist with the a priori identification of task characteristics that impose high cognitive demand, and (iii) the implications for understanding reasoning in dynamic and unconstrained environments outside the laboratory. We conclude that relational complexity theory provides a strong foundation from which to explore the influence of individual differences in performance further.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">relational complexity</field><field name="subject">cogntive complexity</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">processing limitations</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157930</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism destination development: Beyond Butler</field><field name="creator">Breakey, Noreen Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150604 Tourism Marketing</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Sunshine Coast.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158161</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical assessment of economic development, manufacturing and the political economy in Queensland, 1900 to 1930</field><field name="creator">Cameron, David Bruce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

In a world of seismic economic, environmental and social change the need for a more sustainable way of behaving is rapidly becoming a priority for mere survival (Porritt 2006). Indeed, it has been suggested that the collapse of economic growth in 2008 has primarily been the result of a dependence on outmoded models of consumption (Hamilton 2003, James 2008). The first section of the thesis documents as a narrative the shift from a label design, which is the result of a research paper, to the launch of a food brand within a university community, which is the commercial outcome of research. The second section of the thesis is the study that examines a nascent label design consisting of a list of ingredients as semiotic triggers that inform the consumer about the product at the point of purchase. The methodology is drawn from mediated discourse analysis (Scollon 2005, Norris &amp; Jones 2005) and multimodal discourse analysis where each mode is viewed as a system of representation with rules and regularities attached to it (Kress &amp; van Leeuwen 2006). I focus on the nascent shift in modal values of packaging design within the site of engagement of a supermarket.

Auckland City Council's Community Services and Recreation Department is no different. Faced with a rapidly expanding and diverse population, which is also increasingly sedentary and unhealthy, the department wished to explore an approach which would encapsulate and help to solve the issues that they are facing (McDermott, 2009; Rowe, 2008; Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, 2009). A human rights-based approach to public policy development was identified as being part of the answer to Auckland City Council's active recreation challenges. Auckland University of Technology's Institute of Public Policy were contracted to undertake research into this public policy approach, that is increasingly used internationally. Could this be implemented in New Zealand? It is acknowledged that a human rights-based approach to public policy development and implementation can help to promote accountability, empowers and it also involves people in the decision making process and ensures that individuals are not discriminated against (Department of Health, 2007). While a human rights-based approach ensures that international obligations are adhered to, the flow-on effect of implementing a human rights-based approach includes having community "buy-in" to a project or proposal, by making public policy more "person centred" (Department of Health, 2007). Key informant interviews were undertaken in 2009; these highlighted how human rights approaches are currently being implemented in New Zealand, although not necessarily in a methodical or consistent manner. Document analysis was also conducted on key policy documents within New Zealand and the United Kingdom using discourse analysis and a human rights lens. In conclusion it was found that the implementation of a human rights-based approach in Auckland City would help to address the issues presented, such as population changes and inactivity and also help to increase participation amongst non-participants. SPARC's focus has moved towards organised sport, children and youth participation and on elite athletes. Local authorities in New Zealand need to act to ensure that the mental, social, health and economic well-being of their communities is preserved and enhanced through active recreation. Taking a human rights-based approach to active recreation policy development would contribute towards achieving these outcomes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">active recreation</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Auckland City Council</field><field name="subject">SPARC</field><field name="subject">sport</field><field name="subject">recreation</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/1002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imaging of flowing molten metal using electrical resistance tomography</field><field name="creator">Hashemizadeh, Farhang</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng)--University of South Australia, 1995</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical impedance tomography</field><field name="subject">Tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83272</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42608</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of leg pain ('Growing pains') in children aged four to six years</field><field name="creator">Evans, Angela M</field><field name="description">Growing pains has been reported in the medical literature since 1823 with frequent, subsequent and ongoing inclusion ever since.

treatments for heat-unstable white wine.</field><field name="creator">Muhlack, Richard Anthony</field><field name="description">Protein-induced wine haze is a major concern to the wine industry worldwide. While the presence of protein haze is unlikely to affect the sensory profile, consumers will generally reject wines containing hazes as they appear microbially spoiled. Consequently, an important step during commercial winemaking is to treat wines with bentonite, which removes heat unstable proteins by adsorption, and prevents haze formation. Whilst this process is effective, it is claimed to adversely affect the quality of the treated wine under certain conditions. Furthermore, 5-10% of the wine volume is typically occluded in bentonite lees. This wine is either lost or substantially diminished in quality and value during recovery. Therefore the development of alternative and economically viable process technologies that maintain wine quality and reduce costs would be highly desirable. This thesis is concerned with the development of alternative and innovative approaches to bentonite treatment of wine. Particular emphasis was placed on developing practical research outcomes that could be readily commercially adopted. Pursuant to this, fundamental research regarding the mechanics of protein adsorption onto bentonite was undertaken to gain an understanding of how bentonite properties relate to adsorption and settling behaviour in wine. The effect of bentonite heat treatment on protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour in a model wine was also investigated. In general, heating was found to increase the initial hindered settling velocity and reduce both protein adsorption capacity and the final volume of lees. Particle size, pH and cation exchangeability of bentonites and the changes that occur to these properties on heating are related to the nature of bonding between cations and the clay surface, as are protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour. Partial Least Squares (PLS) Analysis showed that the variance in individual cation exchangeability and the total cation exchange capacity was primarily responsible for the observed variance in protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour. PLS analysis was also used to develop correlations for the prediction of adsorption and settling behaviour, based on the physical and chemical properties of the bentonites tested. Qualitative comparison of the volume fraction of model wine occluded by each of the bentonites indicated that certain heat treatments may result in a combination of protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour which would produce a significant reduction in wine loss. The effect of different factors on adsorption of a purified grape protein (VVTL1) in a model wine was investigated using a factorial design approach with surface response analysis. Adsorption of VVTL1 by sodium bentonite was well characterised by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. pH, temperature, potassium concentration ([K]), and the pH*[K]interaction were all found to have a significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on the adsorption capacity. Block effects appeared to correctly correlate with bentonite slurry age, suggesting that increasing slurry age may have a positive effect on adsorption capacity. Ethanol concentration, phenolic (caffeic acid and catechin)  oncentration, sugar (glucose and fructose) concentration, as well as the pH*temperature and temperature*[K] interactions did not have a significant effect. The equilibrium constant was found to be independent of the factors studied. This may be explained by changes in protein structure and charge with pH, which affect electrostatic interaction with the bentonite surface. Variation in potassium concentration can cause similar effects and may also influence adsorption capacity by affecting bentonite swelling and zeta potential. This knowledge was applied to the development of in-line dosing of bentonite as an alternative process strategy for commercial use. Field tests of in-line dosing at a commercial winery were conducted on a Sultana wine and Gordo (Muscat of Alexandria) juice with Vitiben and SIHA-Aktiv-Bentonit G bentonites. Fining performance was monitored by heat testing and quantification of heat unstable protein by HPLC. Heat test turbidity and heat unstable protein concentration were reduced in a similar manner upon fining. These reductions were achieved with a contact time of less than two minutes. Sensory evaluation of Sultana wine fined with Vitiben by balanced reference duo-trio difference tests did not detect any difference between untreated, in-line dosed and batch fined wine. A dynamic simulation model of in-line dosing was developed and compared with field trial results, marking the first quantitative study of the dynamic adsorption kinetics of wine protein adsorption onto bentonite. The simulation results confirmed the rapid adsorption behaviour observed during field testing, and provided strong evidence that protein adsorption occurs predominantly on the external particle surface only, with adsorption kinetics being limited by external-film mass transfer. Incomplete separation of bentonite from wine/juice during centrifugation produced a carryover of up to 30% of the added bentonite into the clarified wine. If this problem can be overcome, use of in-line dosing instead of batch fining could eliminate significant value losses presently arising from quality downgrades of wine recovered from bentonite lees by rotary drum vacuum filtration. Moreover, in-line dosing of selected heattreated bentonites under optimal wine or juice conditions may provide even further costs savings whilst maintaining wine quality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine and winemaking; bentonite</field><field name="subject">Bentonite.</field><field name="subject">White wines.</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59437</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of gastric motility in health and diabetes.</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Julie Eva</field><field name="description">The human stomach is a complex organ with sophisticated function. &#8211; The control of delivery of nutrients to the small intestine is tightly regulated, and the patterns and determinants of the associated processes are numerous, complex and interrelated. The presence of nutrients in the small intestine stimulates the release of a number of gastrointestinal hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Exogenous GLP-1 reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and this is thought to be via a slowing of gastric emptying (GE). The effects of endogenous GLP-1 on GE and glycaemia were evaluated using exendin(9-39), a GLP-1 antagonist, in healthy subjects, in a randomised, placebo-controlled study, in Chapter 5. Exendin(9-39) increased postprandial glycaemia through an acceleration of GE; these findings support the putative role of GLP-1 as an enterogastrone. The capacity to measure GE has greatly increased the understanding of normal and disordered gastric physiology. 30 &#8211; 50 % of patients with longstanding diabetes have delayed GE. Scintigraphy remains the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; in the measurement of GE, however, it is associated with a radiation burden. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography was validated against scintigraphy in healthy subjects. In Chapter 6, GE was measured concurrently by 3D ultrasonography and scintigraphy in patients with diabetic gastroparesis, and good correlation and agreement was found between both techniques. Glycaemic control represents one of the main pathogenetic factors of diabetic gastroparesis. Hyperglycaemia slows, while hypoglycaemia accelerates, GE in healthy subjects and patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes. Chapter 7 reports a study investigating the effects of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia vs. euglycaemia on GE in longstanding type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycaemia accelerated GE of a mixed solid/liquid meal; the magnitude of this acceleration was greater when GE during euglycaemia was slower. In contrast to glucose, the effects of intravenous (iv) fructose (used widely in the diabetic diet) on GE are less well understood. The comparative effects of iv fructose, glucose and saline on GE and antropyloroduodenal motility in healthy males are reported in Chapter 8. Compared with saline, fructose infusion was associated with a slowing of GE and suppression of antral waves, the magnitude of which was comparable to glucose. Treatment for the management of gastroparesis is currently suboptimal and there is a need for novel prokinetic agents. Itopride has demonstrated prokinetic activity in dogs. The effects of itopride on GE, glycaemia and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were studied in patients with longstanding diabetes in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial (Chapter 9). There was a trend for itopride to accelerate both solid and liquid GE. 48 % of patients had delayed solid and/or liquid GE on placebo, and in this group, itopride accelerated liquid, but not solid, GE. Autonomic neuropathy represents another pathogenetic factor of diabetic gastroparesis, and delayed GE is more prevalent in patients with autonomic dysfunction. There is evidence that C-peptide improves autonomic nerve function (ANF) in type 1 diabetes. The effects of C-peptide on GE and ANF were studied in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes in randomised, placebo-controlled design, in Chapter 10. C-peptide had no effect on solid or liquid GE, or ANF. Gastroparesis, particularly in patients with diabetes, represents an important clinical problem. The studies presented in this thesis have provided fundamental insights into the measurement and determinants of gastric motor function and postprandial glycaemia, and treatment of gastroparesis, however, further studies which assess the complex pathogenesis and pathophysiology of gastroparesis, and which include a larger cohort of patients, are warranted.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastric emptying; motility; scintigraphy; diabetes; glycaemia</field><field name="subject">Stomach Motility</field><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable control of grapevine powdery mildew (Uncinula necator Schweinitz Burrill) in vineyards in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Crisp, Peter</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytotrophoblast differentiation in the first trimester of human pregnancy</field><field name="creator">James, Joanna</field><field name="description">In the first trimester of human pregnancy specialised placental cells, termed cytotrophoblasts differentiate into extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), which grow out from the placenta and invade into the maternal decidua, acting to physically attach the placenta to the decidua, and adapt the uterine spiral arteries to support pregnancy. A proportion of these EVTs also temporarily occlude the spiral arteries for approximately the first 10 weeks of gestation, preventing maternal blood flow to the placenta and creating a low oxygen environment in which placental and fetal development occur. The processes of trophoblast outgrowth and invasion, and the establishment of a low oxygen environment, are essential for the success of pregnancy, and inadequate trophoblast invasion into the uterus has been associated with recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. However, the exact mechanisms that control the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts down the extravillous trophoblast lineage are poorly understood. Since the extent of this invasive process is unique to human implantation, animal models are of limited value in studying trophoblast invasion. Existing in vitro models have major limitations in that many are very difficult to quantify while others many not study the correct trophoblast population. The research in this thesis has focussed on the development of novel models by which to study cytotrophoblast differentiation, and the use of these models to further understand cytotrophoblast differentiation down the EVT lineage, and the regulation of EVT outgrowth by oxygen. Methods Outgrowth from first trimester villous explants was characterized using immunohistochemistry. Explant viability was investigated using dual staining with chloromethylfluorescin diacetate (CMFDA) and ethidium bromide, by examining DNA laddering, and by immunostaining sectioned explants over 96 hours of culture. The extended viability of cytotrophoblasts in multilayered cell islands in villous tips was exploited to isolate these cells using sequential trypsin digests of cultured villous explants. The trophoblast population obtained were characterized by immunohistochemistry. Finally, villous explants were cultured in either 1.5% or 8% oxygen and the frequency and area of outgrowths was quantified in order to determine the effect of gestation and oxygen on EVT outgrowth. Results Approximately 1/4 of explants cultured in 20% oxygen produced EVT outgrowth. Outgrowth formation and expansion resulted from proliferation of cells in the tips of anchoring villi, and EVTs within the outgrowth did not proliferate. The percentage of explants producing outgrowth declined as gestation increased from 8 to 12 weeks. Dual staining with CMFDA and ethidium bromide revealed degeneration of the syncytiotrophoblast by non-apoptotic mechanisms within 4 hours of culture, but this syncytiotrophoblast layer was able to be regenerated. The majority of cytotrophoblasts died within one week of culture, but despite this explants were able to produce EVT outgrowth for up to 3 weeks due to the extended survival of a specific set of cytotrophoblasts located in cell islands in the tips of anchoring villi. These surviving cells were able to differentiate into EVTs, but not regenerate the surrounding syncytiotrophoblast in the villus tip. Trypsinization of first trimester villi after extended explant culture resulted in the isolation of a viable population of &#8216;putative EVT progenitors&#8217; that did not syncytialise in culture, but were able to proliferate. 20% of these cells differentiated down the EVT lineage within 96 hours of culture. The putative EVT progenitors expressed markers previously localised to cytotrophoblasts in cell islands of anchoring villi, including &#945;v&#946;6 integrin and FGFR-2. The addition of exogenous FGF-4 did not affect the differentiation of these cells into EVTs, nor did FGF-4 alter the frequency of EVT outgrowth from explants. Culture in 1.5% oxygen significantly reduced the frequency and area of outgrowths in comparison to 8% oxygen. HLA-G and &#945;1 integrin were both expressed throughout outgrowths with no difference in expression of these proteins between oxygen concentrations. Gestation influenced the response of explants to oxygen, with a significant differential response to oxygen concentration in placentae under 11 weeks of gestation but no differential response in placentae of 11 or 12 weeks. Conclusions In the first trimester, oxygen and gestational age regulate extravillous trophoblast outgrowth in both an independent and interdependent manner. The cytotrophoblast population in the first trimester does not consist of one homogenous bipotent population. Rather there are at least two separate populations: 1) EVT progenitors that exist in the tips of potential anchoring villi that are likely to be committed to EVT differentiation and 2) monolayer villous cytotrophoblasts which are likely to be committed to syncytiotrophoblast differentiation. The second population is easily isolated by traditional enzymatic digestion methods whereas the first much smaller population can be isolated by exploiting their prolonged survival in explant culture.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321014 Obstetrics and gynaecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2607</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of Cambodians in New Zealand: achievement, cultural identity and community development</field><field name="creator">Liev, Man Hau</field><field name="description">This thesis has two foci: how Cambodians with a refugee background manage their new life in Aotearoa/New Zealand, and how an identity as a Khmer Kiwi transnational community has developed. Analytic concepts&#8212; such as forced migration, cultural bereavement, adaptation, integration, diaspora, transnationalism, identification, and community of practice&#8212; are used to trace the trajectory of the contemporary way of life of Cambodians, their community development, and their cultural identity. The data gathered from mixedmethod research reveal the various opinions, strategies, coping mechanisms, and paths that Cambodian participants have adopted in order to adapt to life in New Zealand and still maintain their Khmer heritage. The majority of participants were proud of their personal achievements, and now have found normalcy in their new life. Individual struggles to engage and integrate with multicultural New Zealand society have required negotiation and protection of group interests, and inevitably some of these have resulted in conflicts and fragmentation within the Khmer community. Religious practice, organisation, and leadership became the main driving forces for asserting Khmer community identity. Collective memory was harnessed to deal with shared cultural bereavement, and the quest for belonging lent momentum to the community&#8217;s development and management of its identity. Khmer Theravada Buddhism has emerged as a means by which the majority of Cambodians can achieve their spiritual wellbeing, and has become a platform for various community identity developments within the New Zealand social and legal contexts. Gender roles and structures are a significant part of community development and of my analysis. This development of Khmer identity in New Zealand is a new strand of Khmer identity: Khmer heritage, transnational experience, and &#8216;Kiwi-ism&#8217;. Such transformation of identity reflects geo-political influences on integration in the form of belonging to and identifying with two or more groups. For example, the majority of participants proudly identified themselves as Khmer Kiwis. Their transnational lives have been enriched by their country of origin (Cambodia) and their country of residence (Aotearoa/New Zealand). Key words: Cambodian refugees, forced migration, adaptation, integration, transnationalism, Buddhism, Khmer identity, community development, and community of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanism of washback on teaching and learning</field><field name="creator">Mizutani, Satomi</field><field name="description">The current research investigated the mechanism of the phenomenon known as washback (i.e., the impact of assessment on teaching and learning) in the context of a new national standards-based assessment system in New Zealand, particularly focusing on the area of the teaching and learning of Japanese as a foreign language. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) was progressively implemented across all subjects in the final three years of secondary schooling from 2002. It replaced norm-referenced assessments and aimed to function as assessment for learning as well as of learning. The research consisted of three studies. Studies One and Two investigated washback effects of NCEA as perceived by teachers and students of Japanese, and beliefs about NCEA which contributed to the washback effects. Participants claimed that the majority of the intended positive washback effects were promoted by the assessment, but the nature of the washback depended on beliefs about NCEA held by teachers and students. Students tended to report more negative washback of NCEA than did teachers. Study Three explored the role that contextual factors (e.g., subject, gender) and beliefs might play in mediating washback. This large-scale study involved teachers and students of Japanese, French, History, and Mathematics. Teacher and Student Questionnaires were developed to investigate washback of NCEA and beliefs about NCEA, Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Efficacy as well as to collect relevant background information on the participants. The study revealed that some contextual factors played a role in mediating certain types of beliefs and washback effects. The results also confirmed the crucial role that beliefs play in mediating washback, indicating that positive washback was promoted when participants&#8217; beliefs were in line with the intentions of the assessment. It is concluded that for educational reform through assessment change to be successful, stake holders&#8217; beliefs about the role of assessment may need to be altered. A model is presented to describe the mechanism of washback, showing how washback could be mediated directly and indirectly by contextual factors and beliefs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4545</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the immunology, physiology and epidemiology of pertussis</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Mark Greenslade</field><field name="description">This volume contains an introduction to the topic of pertussis followed by twelve papers on pertussis arising from research conducted while I was a research fellow at St. George's Hospital Medical School from 1985 to 1988. Paper 1 provides a qualitative description of the serum antibody responses to several Bordetella pertussis antigens. It demonstrates that the serum antibody response to a specific B. pertussis antigen, following either natural infection or vaccination, is dependent both on the antigen and on the subject. Some B. pertussis antigens appear to consistently evoke strong serum antibody responses following either natural infection or vaccination, while other B. pertussis antigens appear to consistently fail to evoke any significant serum antibody response. Other B. pertussis antigens induce an antibody response in a variable proportion of subjects. Paper 2 describes the serum IgG, IgA and IgM responses to B. pertussis antigens in patients with pertussis. These antibody responses are compared with those in the family contacts of patients with pertussis and with those in infants immunised with a whole cell pertussis vaccine. It demonstrates that both pertussis and pertussis vaccination produce marked serum antibody responses to three B. pertussis antigens. In contrast, family contacts who are exposed to a patient with pertussis, but who themselves fail to develop disease, have a minor antibody response to the same antigens. Immunity to disease in these family contacts is associated with high titres of antibody to B. pertussis antigens at the time of exposure to infection. Paper 3 demonstrates the serum antibody responses to B. pertussis antigens in two subjects immunised with new acellular pertussis vaccines. The antibody responses are compared with those in subjects who had been immunised with a whole cell pertussis vaccine, and with those in subjects who had suffered natural infection. The new acellular pertussis vaccines are shown to induce antibody responses solely to two purified B. pertussis antigens, and not to other potential contaminating antigens. Paper 4 demonstrates that the IgA antibody response in nasal mucus in patients with pertussis is less pronounced than the serum antibody responses. It also demonstrates that titres of antibody in nasal mucus are not especially strongly correlated with immunity to pertussis in family contacts. Paper 5 compares the serum antibody responses to B. pertussis antigens in breast fed infants with pertussis with those in bottle fed infants with pertussis. It also compares the levels of IgA to B. pertussis antigens in breast milk from mothers of infants with pertussis with the levels in breast milk from mothers of healthy infants. This paper provides further evidence that B. pertussis infection does not produce an especially strong secretory immune response. Paper 6 provides evidence that B. pertussis infection does not produce a significant impairment of immunoglobulin synthesis. Paper 7 compares the responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes, from patients with pertussis and two control groups, to in vitro stimulation with B. pertussis antigens. This study is the first to show that B. pertussis infection induces cell mediated immune responses. Paper 8 describes the respiratory physiology of six infants with severe pertussis. It demonstrates that abrupt severe hypoxaemia may be due to prolonged apnoea or may occur despite continued breathing movements and respiratory airflow. It postulates that these findings are due to a ventilation perfusion mismatch secondary to alveolar atalectasis caused by a defect in lung surfactant synthesis, secretion or function. Paper 9 describes the effects of B. pertussis infection on the ciliary function and electron microscopic appearances of human nasal epithelial cells. These findings are extended by similiar investigations perfomed on human nasal epithelial cells exposed to B. pertussis toxins in vitro. Paper 10 attempts to explain the large-scale epidemiology of pertussis by a simple mathematical formula. This formula is then used to derive an estimate of the proportion of the population susceptible to pertussis. Finally the relationship between the incidence of pertussis and the level of vaccine uptake is illustrated using data from several countries during the last century. Paper 11 describes the small-scale epidemiology of pertussis and demonstrates that pertussis is usually transmitted by patients with clinical disease rather than by persons with either atypical disease or asymptomatic infection. Paper 12 briefly discusses the use of erythromycin and other antimicrobial agents in the treatment and prophylaxis of pertussis.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5521</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General biology and reproductive fitness of Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker : a thesis presented in partial fulfllment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Protection at the Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yadav, Anand</field><field name="description">Tasmanian lacewing, Micromus tasmaniae Walker, is an important predator of a number of economically important pests such as aphids. This study was conducted to investigate some aspects of general biology and factors affecting the reproductive fitness of this species Emergence of M. tasmaniae peaked 3 h before light off and there was no significant difference in emergence patterns between males and females. Males became sexually mature earlier than females. Mating success significantly increased from the first to the eleventh hour after lights on. Predation, development and oviposition of M. tasmaniae were affected when reared under different photoperiods [i.e. 24:0, 16:8, 12:12, 0:24 h (light:dark)]. Results indicate that no individuals entered diapause at either an immature or adult stage. M. tasmaniae larvae could feed in both the photophase and scotophase and late instar larvae consumed significantly more aphids than early instar larvae. M. tasmaniae reared at 16:8 h developed faster and had lower mortality, heavier adult body weight and higher reproductive output in terms of fecundity and fertility rate. Therefore, mass-rearing programmes are recommended to be carried out at 16:8 h to obtain the higher quality of individuals and faster increase of populations. The larger-the better theory predicts that the reproductive fitness is positively linearly associated with body size or weight. However, the body weight of female M. tasmaniae had no effect on the reproductive fitness in terms of fecundity, fertility, fertility rate, oviposition period and longevity. The male body weight may contribute to the population growth of M. tasmaniae as the average females that mated with average or heavy males had significantly higher fecundity, fertility and fertility rate and longer reproductive period. These results suggest that development of any control method that should selectively mass-produce heavy and average individuals in the laboratory would help increasing M. tasmaniae quality and populations. M. tasmaniae is a polygamous species. Results indicate that female remating either with the same or different males was crucial for maximizing their reproductive success. Males could inseminate up to eight females and father about one thousand offspring during their life span.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tasmanian lacewing</field><field name="subject">Micromus tasmaniae</field><field name="subject">pest predators</field><field name="subject">plant protection</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Un i form "consisting of one" : a written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Clement, Julie</field><field name="description">Uni form is an exploration into the act of getting dressed.

This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At My Mother's Table: Migration, (Re)production and Return Between Hadchit, North Lebanon and Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hyndman-Rizik, Nelia Nacima</field><field name="description">In the era of globalisation, studies of migration focus on mobility, deterritorialised identities and diasporic forms of belonging across nation state boundaries.  Indeed, uprootedness from the soil of home and place has resulted in a general condition of &#239;&#191;&#189;homelessness&#239;&#191;&#189; in late modernity, referred to as the diasporic condition.  The search for an &#239;&#191;&#189;absolute home&#239;&#191;&#189; has become the Holy Grail for pilgrims in late modernity and forms the basis for this study, which explores the &#239;&#191;&#189;migrant&#239;&#191;&#189;s conundrum&#239;&#191;&#189;: does home move where the migrant moves, or is it forever tied to the primordialism of place, soil and kinship?  Through an examination of the construction of homeliness amongst an immigrant community of 500 households from the village of Hadchit, North Lebanon, who reside in Western Sydney, Australia it will be shown how their strategies of home-building depend upon the capacity to imagine themselves as being united by kinship, a shared village of origins and as part of the broader communal Maronite identity (Mwarne), which now transcends nation state boundaries.  Patrilineage (bayt), village (day&#239;&#191;&#189;aa) and sect (ta&#239;&#191;&#189;eefa) have historically defined Lebanese sectarian identities and now, as this study shows, are deployed as a strategy of home-building and community construction in diaspora.  However, capitalist social relations of production in Sydney have transformed bayt, day&#239;&#191;&#189;aa and ta&#239;&#191;&#189;eefa amongst the second generation through the gendered renegotiation of the marriage contract from relations of descent to relations of consent.  Thus, the Hadchitis now face a crisis of (re)production and attribute this to the Australian state being hukum niswen, ruled by women, an inversion of the gendered order of power in Lebanon.  Through pilgrimages to the ancestral village &#239;&#191;&#189;migr&#239;&#191;&#189;s seek a spiritual resolution to the contradictions of migration through the restoration of their connection to place, but find they cannot seamlessly belong in Hadchit.  Meanwhile, multicultural crisis and a milieu of anti-Lebanese racism limit their claims to national belonging in Australia.  This study finds that the contradictions of the migration process are unresolvable through physical mobility, because the feeling of &#239;&#191;&#189;home&#239;&#191;&#189; is ultimately an affective and social construction that transcends place.  The elusive quality that defines home and provides a sense of unconditional belonging is, in fact, socially constructed by women, through their daily practices of care within the home and the most important woman for the construction of homeliness is the matriarch, sit el bayt &#239;&#191;&#189; the power of the house.  Thus, the place where the immigrant can be at home is metaphorically at their &#239;&#191;&#189;mother&#239;&#191;&#189;s table&#239;&#191;&#189;.  The shifting and gendered construction of home amongst the Hadchitis in Sydney has also led to a transformation of cultural identity amongst them.  Through the process of migration, (re)production and return the Hadchitis have become Lebanese-Australians.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Migration</field><field name="subject">Return</field><field name="subject">Lebanon</field><field name="subject">Mothering</field><field name="subject">Home</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100914.135631</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Muscle glycogen repletion without food intake during recovery from exercise in humans</field><field name="creator">Low, Chee Yong</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It is well established that fish, amphibians and reptiles recovering from physical activity of near maximal intensity can replenish completely their muscle glycogen stores in the absence of food. In contrast, the extent to which these stores are replenished under these conditions in humans has been reported in all but one study to be partial. This implies that a few consecutive bouts of intense exercise might eventually lead to the sustained depletion of the muscle glycogen stores in humans if food is unavailable, thus limiting their capacity to engage in fight or flight behaviors unless mechanisms exist to protect muscle glycogen against sustained depletion. The objective of Study 1 was to test this prediction. Eight participants performed three intense exercise bouts each separated by a recovery period of 75 minutes. Although only 53% of muscle glycogen was replenished after the first exercise bout (postexercise and post-recovery glycogen levels of 246 &#177; 25 and 320 &#177; 36 mmol.kg-1 dry mass, respectively), all the glycogen mobilised during the second and third bouts was completely replenished during the respective recovery periods, with glycogen reaching levels of 319 &#177; 29 mmol.kg-1 dry mass after recovery from the third bout. These findings show that humans are not different from other vertebrate species in that there are conditions where humans have the ability to completely replenish without food intake the muscle glycogen mobilised during exercise. The results of our first study raise the intriguing possibility that humans have pre-set muscle glycogen levels that are protected against sustained depletion, with the extent to which muscle glycogen stores are replenished after exercise being dependent on the amount of glycogen required to attain those protected levels.  ... During recovery, glycogen levels in the NORM group increased by more than ~50% and reached levels close to those alleged to be protected (189 &#177; 21 mmol.kg-1 dry mass), whereas no glycogen was deposited in the HCHO group. The sustained post-exercise activation of glycogen synthase, the transient fall in whole body carbohydrate oxidation rate, the increased mobilisation of body proteins, and the prolonged elevation in NEFA levels most probably played important roles in enabling glycogen synthesis in the NORM group. In conclusion, this thesis shows for the first time that there are some conditions (e.g. low pre-exercise muscle glycogen levels) where humans recovering from intense exercise have the capacity, like other species, to replenish completely their muscle glycogen stores from endogenous carbon sources. This study also suggests that humans protect preset levels of muscle glycogen against sustained depletion and at levels high enough to support at least one maximal sprint effort to exhaustion. Evidence is also provided for the existence of a feedback mechanism whereby glycogen below their protected levels mediate the activation of glycogen synthase to restore the depleted muscle glycogen stores back to their protected levels. Our findings, however, leave us with a number of novel unanswered questions which clearly show that the regulation of glycogen metabolism is far from the simple process generally depicted in most textbooks of biochemistry.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glycogen -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Glycogen -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Muscles -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Gylcogen</field><field name="subject">Recovery</field><field name="subject">Without food</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0115</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of specific emotions in affective priming effects</field><field name="creator">Boakes, Jolee Alison</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The finding that less time is needed to evaluate the valence of a target when it is preceded by a prime of the same valence, as opposed to one of the opposite valence, has become known as the affective priming effect. The research reported here investigated a new model of the mechanisms underlying affective priming effects, which focuses on the role of specific emotions within global valence categories. Specifically, this model stipulates that when presented with a stimulus that elicits particular emotions, the area of the brain corresponding to that emotion is automatically stimulated. This in turn will produce a diffuse activation of meaning nodes that are associated with that emotion. This emotion-based priming model departs from previous spreading activation accounts of affective priming, as it suggests that the facilitation effects observed in such studies may be due primarily to spreading activation via emotion-congruent, rather than valence-congruent, nodes. The overarching goal of the empirical research programme reported here was to test predictions based on this model. In three studies, facilitation effects ascribable to specific emotion-based congruence (e.g., fear-fear) were compared with those ascribable to global valence-based congruence (e.g., negative-negative) alone (i.e., in the absence of emotion-based congruence). Participants made valence judgements on targets which represented one of five basic human emotions: one positive (happy) and four negative (disgust, fear, sad, and anger). ... The fundamental design elements were the same across all three studies: the only difference was in the stimulus format of the prime-target pairs: emotion-laden scenes were used in Study One; facial expressions in Study Two; and emotion-laden words in Study Three. Results showed that, in comparison to the neutral and incongruent baselines, there were significant emotion-based priming effects across all stimulus formats. This result was also consistent across all of the negative emotions employed. Significant valence-based priming effects were, however, also obtained in each of the three studies, although these effects were more inconsistent than those obtained for emotion-based priming. That is, reaction times were significantly shorter on valence-congruent than on neutral and incongruent baseline trials, but only for a portion of the tests performed across the three studies. In Studies One and Two, reaction times were consistently shorter for emotion-congruent prime-target pairs than for valence-congruent prime-target pairs. This trend was absent in Study Three, in which word stimuli were used. These results indicate that while reaction times were facilitated, albeit inconsistently, for valence-congruent prime-target pairs, they were facilitated significantly further for emotion-congruent pairs when picture-based stimuli were used. The emotion-based and valence-based priming effects obtained across the three studies are discussed in terms of three competing theories: (i) spreading activation via global valence nodes, (ii) spreading activation via emotion centres, and (iii) expectancy-based processes. A dual-process hypothesis of affective priming is then proposed. The plausibility of the hypothesis is then explored through a synthesis and re-examination of results reported in previous affective priming research. Directions for future research to elaborate and extend on this work are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotions and cognition</field><field name="subject">Emotions</field><field name="subject">Priming (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Emotional conditioning</field><field name="subject">Affective priming</field><field name="subject">Emotion-based priming</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0116</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boulder beaches: a sedimentological study</field><field name="creator">Oak, Helen Lorraine</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--Macquarie University, School of Earth Sciences, 1981.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boulders -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sediment transport -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sedimentation and deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1959.14/89064</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal concept analysis applications to requirements engineering and design</field><field name="creator">Tilley, Thomas Alan</field><field name="description">Currently, the bulk of applications of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) in software engineering have focussed on software maintenance and re-engineering. In this thesis we broaden the approach by applying FCA to a number of early-phase activities within the software engineering life-cycle. With respect to the requirements engineering phase, a case study is presented comparing two class hierarchies that model aspects of a mass-transit railway ticketing system. The first hierarchy was produced for an existing Object-Z specification of the system while the second was derived using FCA. Contrasting the two hierarchies revealed that they were essentially the same, however, the differences highlighted specification artefacts in the existing hierarchy. With respect to the design phase, the thesis discusses the use of FCA for the navigation and visualisation of Formal Specifications written in Z. In response to the continued call for formal methods tool support, we implement and explore a prototype specification browser that exploits the abstractions afforded by FCA. The research hypothesis is an integrated architecture for navigating formal specifications using FCA. This architecture is realised using ZML and ToscanaJ to produce a practical research tool. The thesis also includes the first broad survey of FCA in the domain of software engineering and an FCA-based methodology for surveying academic literature in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280111 Conceptual Modelling</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">formal concept analysis</field><field name="subject">requirements analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">software engineering</field><field name="subject">formal specification</field><field name="subject">Z</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157991</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge exposed to external carbon sources</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Maneesha Prasaad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to identify the denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge from full-scale treatment plants and from small-scale reactors exposed to acetate or methanol as external carbon sources. Biological denitrification is currently the most widely used, sustainable and cost-effective process to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Increasingly strict effluent discharge standards are posing significant challenges to plant operators to reduce effluent NO3--N concentrations to levels as low as 2-3 mg L-1 or even lower. The lack of sufficient influent carbon in many municipal wastewater treatment plants makes it very difficult to achieve such low NO3--N concentrations in the effluent. An effective solution to the problem is to introduce additional external carbon sources to enhance denitrification. The selection of external carbon sources is not purely based on costs but is also dependent on the possible microbial transformations that these carbon sources may bring about in activated sludge. The most common carbon source used is methanol due to its low cost, but it has been found to cause long delays until an improvement in denitrification performance is observed. On the other hand, acetate has been found to improve denitrification almost instantaneously when added, but it has a significantly higher cost. In this study, methanol and acetate utilising denitrifiers were investigated in activated sludge with and without enrichment in laboratory scale bioreactors. The relevant denitrifiers were identified and evaluated in situ using culture independent methods particularly stable isotope probing (SIP), 16S rDNA cloning, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR). Activated sludge collected from a biological nutrient removal plant exhibiting good denitrification was enriched in an anoxically-operated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) by feeding methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The SBR was operated over a duration of 7 months and the SBR denitrification rate improved from 0.02 mg NO3--N mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)-1 h-1 to a steady-state value of 0.06 mg NO3-N mg MLVSS-1 h-1. At steady state operation the enriched biomass was subjected to SIP with 13C-methanol to biomark the denitrifiers capable of utilising methanol under anoxic conditions. The separated 12C-DNA and 13C-DNA fractions from the SIP experiment were individually subjected to full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotype (Group-A clones) in the 13C-library was closely related to the obligate methylotrophs Methylobacillus and Methylophilus in the order Methylophilales of the Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities), while the most abundant clone groups in the 12C-library mostly belonged to the family Saprospiraceae in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for FISH to target the Group-A clones and Methylophilales (probes DEN67 and MET1216, respectively) and the Saprospiraceae clones (probe SAP553). Application of these probes on SBR biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of SBR denitrification and relative abundance of DEN67-targeted bacteria in the SBR community. By contrast, no correlation was found between denitrification rate and the relative abundances of the well known denitrifying genera Hyphomicrobium and Paracoccus nor the Saprospiraceae-clones visualised by FISH in the SBR biomass. FISH combined with microautoradiography independently confirmed that the DEN67-targeted cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of anoxic [14C] methanol uptake in the enriched biomass. As observed in full-scale operations, the methanol-fed SBR experienced a lag period of several weeks before denitrification performance increased. Using FISH quantification, it was shown that this coincided with the lag phase in the growth of the DEN67-targeted denitrifying population. It was therefore concluded that the Methylophilales bacteria dominant in our SBR system are likely to be important in full-scale methanol-fed denitrifying sludges. The acetate utilising microbial consortium in activated sludge was investigated without prior enrichment using stable isotope probing (SIP). 13C-acetate was used in SIP to biomark the DNA of the denitrifiers. The extracted 13C-DNA fraction was subjected to a full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the 13C-library were closely related to bacterial families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae of class Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities). Seven oligonucleotide probes (DEN444, DEN220, DEN581, DEN441, DEN124, DEN220a and DEN1454) for use in FISH was designed to specifically target the identified phylotypes. Application of these probes on the sludge of a continuously fed denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (CFDSBR) operated over a duration of 16 days indicated a strong correlation between the level of CFDSBR denitrification and relative abundance of all probe-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community. FISH combined with microautoradiography (FISH-MAR) further confirmed that the DEN581- and DEN124-targeted cells dominating the CFDSBR were capable of taking up [14C] acetate under anoxic conditions. The initial occurrence of the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria and the final dominance of DEN581- and DEN124-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community were likely related to the changing in-reactor nitrite concentrations during the first few days of CFDSBR operation. Hence, the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria were hypothesised to have low affinities for nitrite while DEN124- and DEN581-targeted bacteria have higher nitrite affinities. However, it was clear that all probe-targeted bacteria were denitrifiers capable of utilising acetate as a carbon source. The rapid increase in numbers of the probe-targeted organisms positively correlates with the immediate increase in denitrification rates. The rapid response and community shifts observed when acetate was used to enhance denitrification suggest that an intermittent application of acetate is quite effective to temporarily enhance the denitrification capacity of a treatment plant. However, the importance of a bacterial impact assessment of activated sludge subjected to intermittent acetate supplementation is recommended prior to the wide use of acetate in the wastewater industry. The acetate utilising denitrifying microbial communities investigated in the previous chapter were characterised according to their eco-physiological properties using the r- and K-selection criteria. The electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (nitrite) affinities of these probe-identified denitrifiers were used as traits for this characterisation. The substrate to microorganism (S/M) ratio was manipulated to provide high and low substrate concentrations in the reactor to create conditions favourable for r- and K-strategists, respectively. Two factors, namely feeding regimes and sludge retention times, were studied to achieve the desired S/M ratios and enable r/K characterisation. The high substrate affinities and high specific growth rates of two probe-identified denitrifiers (DEN124 and DEN581) did not enable resolution of these two organisms with the feeding regimes used in this study. However, the application of different sludge retention times as a control strategy to maintain constant high and low in-reactor S/M ratios enabled characterisation of the two probe-targeted denitrifiers DEN124 and DEN581 as K- and r-strategists, respectively. The in-reactor S/M ratios applied in this study did not facilitate the characterisation of populations targeted by probes DEN444 and DEN1454. The minor fluctuations of the S/M ratios during a cycle in the SBR operation was considered as a drawback, but conclusive results could still be obtained from the study. A chemostat reactor operation with constant loading and variable flow rates is suggested as an alternative. Conclusively, this study was able to identify specific groups of denitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge when exposed to acetate and methanol. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on culture dependent methods, this study adopted a pure culture independent approach to identify microorganisms in relation to their function, i.e. denitrification. Moreover, acetate denitrifiers were in situ characterised based on eco-physiological properties. The identification of denitrifying communities in this study has paved the way to a larger research project on the optimisation of denitrification processes with external acetate, methanol and other carbon supplements. As such, this study has contributed significantly to the understanding of the denitrification processes by linking process data with microbial investigations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">External carbon</field><field name="subject">FISH</field><field name="subject">MAR</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157995</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing Complex Documents</field><field name="creator">Carter, Simon Matthew James</field><field name="description">Change management is a discipline fundamental to the task of building ever more complex computing systems. Properly managed change provides a means whereby alterations to existing components of a complex artefact and their relationships can be evaluated, managed and evolved. This thesis takes as its example Official RAAF Publications, some of which need to be revised as a result of changes to the system they describe. The thesis develops a model of change propagation providing a set of operations to examine and record the changes to a set of publications. Additional operations enable coping with reversing decisions and handling the unexpected arrival of externally generated amendments. The model is extended to cover a finer granularity of entities (at the page level) to determine whether this greater level of detail would ease some tasks. A further extension provides the notion of relationships between the publications of concern, focusing on a dependency relationship between two publications. This enables exploration of the possibility of improving the process by reducing the risk of missing publications needing revision and providing a means by which some tasks can be partly automated thus speeding up the process. The models presented were developed in Sum, a variant of the Z specification language, to gain greater insight into the essential details of the operations and data structures involved. By ignoring implementation details the essential logical steps of each model can be emphasised and their differences and similarities contrasted. This thesis demonstrates that fine-grained change management is feasible. The thesis develops processes that automatically track the status of changes as they are propagated through a set of documents. The greater knowledge of work done on individual pages allows only the page(s) of concern to be affected. The work also enables recommendations to be made as to the applicability of each model and, by comparing the models, provides insight into the amount of work and resources required for tackling change at different levels of granularity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">280302 Software Engineering</field><field name="subject">700199 Computer software and services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">change management</field><field name="subject">change propagation</field><field name="subject">fine-grained change management</field><field name="subject">formal methods</field><field name="subject">Sum specification language</field><field name="subject">Z specification language</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157953</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multidimensional viscous flows at superorbital speeds</field><field name="creator">Silvester, Todd</field><field name="description">A combined experimental and numerical study of multidimensional viscous flows at speeds exceeding 8 km/s is reported. Experiments were performed in the X3 superorbital expansion tube with air and nitrogen test flows at a Mach number and total enthalpy of 10 and 40 MJ/kg, respectively. Laminar skin friction, heat flux and pressure measurements were obtained at regular intervals along one wall of a rectangular duct. The spatial resolution of the transducers was chosen to capture the multidimensional flow phenomena within the duct. Quasi-steady flow periods were established along the entire length of the duct in the test times offered by the expansion tube. Direct skin friction measurements were accomplished through the use of &#145;in house&#146; acceleration compensated transducers. The successful operation of these skin friction transducers in a high performance expansion tube was demonstrated. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainty in measured shear stress was significantly reduced with the development of a new pressure calibration technique. For the conditions tested, Reynolds analogy was shown to be valid to within experimental uncertainty. The experimental data was in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. Three-dimensional numerical simulations of the diverging duct revealed that the flowfield structure in the vicinity of the corners differs from that of an unbounded corner or a constant area duct. Real gas effects other than those present in the residual nonequilibrium levels of freestream dissociation were negligible for the conditions tested. A computational study of two waverider configurations recently tested in the X3 superorbital expansion tube was conducted to assist in the interpretation of past results. The off-design aerodynamic performance was also analyzed and showed that blunting the leading edges dramatically degraded the performance by increasing drag and decreasing lift for the conditions considered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">290207 Satellite, Space Vehicle and Missile Design</field><field name="subject">viscous flows</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="subject">hypervelocity</field><field name="subject">skin friction</field><field name="subject">Reynolds analogy</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">real gas effects</field><field name="subject">multidimensional flows</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158032</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer production from synthetic carbonaceous wastewater using glycogen accumulating organisms</field><field name="creator">Dai, Yu</field><field name="description">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters produced and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy by a wide range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175-180&amp;degC. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non-3HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3HB and 3HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3- hydroxyalkanoate (3HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3HMV) and 3-hydroxy-3- methylbutyrate (3HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3HB, 3HV and minor amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &amp;sup1H and &#185;&amp;sup3C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non-3HB monomers (30&#177;5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3HV fraction. The 3HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28% of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41% based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both the quantity and quality of the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3HB-co-3HV-co-3HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380-460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95&#177;3%) copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3HMV and 3HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3HB and 3HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390-560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 &amp;degC, glass transition temperatures between -8 and 0 &amp;degC, and melting enthalpies (&#916;Hm) between 9.1 and 31.5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3HV&amp;3HMV-rich copolymers and 3HB&amp;3HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158279</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electromagnetic analysis and design of high frequency coils for magnetic resonance</field><field name="creator">Xu, Bin</field><field name="description">As the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves with increasing static magnetic field strength, there is a strong incentive to develop technology to acquire images at higher fields. While magnet technology has made it possible to generate static magnetic fields of 10 T and more, limitations of the radio frequency (RF) hardware prevent the acquisition of high quality images over full regions of interest in clinical applications. Electromagnetic analysis and the design of high frequency RF coils for magnetic resonance are presented in this thesis to attempt to mitigate the limitations of the RF hardware. Analytical and numerical methods are used in this work to analyze the field and frequency behaviors/limits for various RF volume coils in MRI. As the coils&#146; size approach wavelength of operation dimensions, the performance of conventional lumped element design and traditional excitation strategies for these coils, encounter several problems. Field and frequency limits for the traditional RF volume coils are studied to obtain a better understanding of high frequency RF coil designs. Numerical modeling of the excised, fixed human head at the extreme field strength of 11 T is made, which helps to understand the underlying mechanisms for the severe distortions in the MR images in 11T MRI and confirms experimental observations. Results show that the rotating transverse magnetic field (B1) exhibits good homogeneity in air, but strong in-homogeneity with biological loads at 11T. The simulated signal intensity (SI) distribution within the human head confirms that distortions in the experimental images are mainly caused by the field/tissue interactions.. To rapidly simulate RF field behaviour in the human head for MRI applications, Dyadic Green&#146;s function (DGF)/Method of Moments (DGF/MOM) - based solutions of the electromagnetic field (EMFs) inside a head-sized, stratified sphere are presented. Operating profiles are studied with various RF head coils loaded with various head models/phantoms. The RF field behaviour and tissue/field interactions are also obtained by case studies at different frequencies for different coils. New methodologies and innovations on high frequency RF coil design are next investigated. An inverse method with pre-emphasized B1 field is proposed herein, and the method of pre-emphasizing the target field with the consideration of the dielectric materials proved to be encouraging in preliminary designs. The results demonstrate that inverse-method designed coils with pre-emphases of target fields can help in decreasing the notorious bright regions caused by wavelength effects in the human head images at 4T. An 8-element phased array head coil operating at 4T is designed based on a combined idea from reciprocity theorem and inverse method. Using this new method, either circularly or linearly polarized head coils can be designed. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the design concept, which shows that improved B1 field homogeneity is achievable. Another new method in ameliorating image distortion at 11T (470 MHz) MR brain imaging applications uses a shielded 4-element transcieve phased array coil and involves performing 2 separate scans of the same slice with each scan using different excitations during transmission. That is, parallel transmission phase cycling. By optimizing the amplitudes and phases for each set of the scan, signal distortion that is antipodal from one another can be obtained and by combining both images together, image distortion can be alleviated several fold. The simulation results reported herein demonstrate the feasibility of the concept where transmission phase cycling of parallel imaging elements with different excitation pulse reconstruction is theoretically achievable. The strategy of improving the transmitting B1 field homogeneity through active control of source profiles is studied. This method tailors the RF amplitudes and phases applied individually to the rungs of a resonator with the use of an optimization scheme. Numerical simulations are used in an attempt to find optimal source profiles for high frequency RF coils. The simulation results demonstrate the strength of the optimal source profiles for different targets in high field RF coil or phased array designs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158139</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The design and analysis of high frequency phased array coils for MRI</field><field name="creator">Li, Bing Keong Joe</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on extending the use of phased array radiofrequency (RF) coils for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Phased arrays are very useful as receiver coils and have been used over the last 15 years or so to improve receiver coil coverage and to speed up image acquisition. These arrays have almost invariably been constructed and used at mid- to highfrequency (&amp;lt128 MHz), thus there is clearly an opportunity to increase the operating frequency of the phased array and also use these systems in transceive mode. Using phased array coils in transceive mode has the advantage of gaining better spatial specificity of excited regions. Also as the operating wavelength in high field strength is shortened by the dielectric properties of the patient and approaches the size of conventional transmitter coils, there are distinct advantages in using the smaller coils in the phased array system for transmission. In addition, with the ability to independently control the magnitudes and phases of the transmission power on each element of a transceiver phased array system, RF focussing or shimming can be performed during RF transmission. The research work presented in this thesis is therefore, primarily focussed on designing and analysing high frequency phased array coils for MRI applications with transceive and RF focussing capability and investigating the possibility of using focussing transceive phased array coils to ameliorate image distortions that appear in high field MR images. The second major area of work concerns evaluation of the performance of partial parallel imaging when used at high field strength and the compatibility with transceive phased array systems. Common to both areas are investigation into other approaches for the design of high field RF coils, exploring the possibility of new mutual decoupling techniques and the consideration of other numerical computational methods that can assist in designing future high frequency phased array coils and help evaluate the complex field-tissue interactions at high field strength.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="subject">671402 Medical instrumentation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158146</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Healthier Banana roots with mycorrhizae and rhizobacteria</field><field name="creator">Smith, Linda Jane</field><field name="description">Fusarium wilt of banana, also known as Panama disease, is one of the most destructive diseases of banana (Musa spp.) and is regarded as one of the most significant threats to banana production not only in Australia, but worldwide. The causative agent is the soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.: Fr. forma specialis (f. sp.) cubense (E.F. Smith) Snyder and Hansen (Foc) for which options of control are limited, with no commercially viable means of chemical control. Micropropagated bananas are increasingly being used by the Queensland banana industry. This is because they are the best source of disease and pest-free planting material and productivity on the farm can be greatly improved with their use. However, when planting into soils heavily infested with Foc, these plants have been found to be more susceptible than conventional planting material. It is believed that microorganisms such as bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are not available to micropropagated plants raised in a sterile environment, may protect vegetative planting material dug from the field. Adding beneficial microorganisms to micropropagated plants in the nursery before planting in the field may provide some protection from soilborne diseases such as fusarium wilt and lead to improved performance. This research was undertaken to identify endophytic and rhizosphere inhabiting bacteria (including fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), spore-forming and chitinolytic bacteria) and fungal endophytes such as AMF that enhance plant growth and inhibit or reduce the infection of Foc in micropropagated banana plants. It is widely known that suppressive soils exist where fusarium wilt does not reach epidemic proportions. Laboratory results to date support a microbial basis for this suppressiveness. Wilt suppressive sites were located in Queensland and northern New South Wales and roots of banana plants were collected. Rhizosphere root washings and surface sterilised root segments were plated onto solid growth media to isolate both rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria. Bacterial isolates were initially evaluated using various in vitro tests including antagonism on agar, chitinolytic ability, production of fluorescent siderophores when grown on Kings B media, spore production and ability to lyse Foc mycelia using Foc as a sole carbon source. This process assisted with selection of isolates that may have the most biological control potential. Based on these tests 41 isolates were chosen for further investigation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from banana roots growing in disease suppressive soils and were also obtained from a culture collection at the Gatton Campus of The University of Queensland. A total of 10 pot cultures were prepared using sunflower as a host plant. Mycorrhizal fungi produced typical intraradical structures (arbuscules, vesicles, hyphae) when banana plants were inoculated with AMF. To assess the biological control potential of bacteria and AMF against Foc, a reliable small plant bioassay system was required. Attempts by various researchers to develop a reliable bioassay have been made in the past however infection of banana plants by the pathogen was inconsistent. The inconsistencies of previous work may microorganisms in the growth of micropropagated banana plants and protection of young plants from disease. However, ability to reduce disease assessed by internal rating of vascular discolouration appears to be influenced by host genotype. While reduction in disease severity and promotion of plant growth was observed in glasshouse trials, this was not observed in field trials at harvest. If plants had been assessed for differences in growth and susceptibility to disease plus nutrient uptake at the early stages of growth following transplanting into the field rather than at harvest, differences between microbial treated and untreated plants may have been determined. In the field, environmental factors such as drought influenced disease development and plant growth of inoculated plants at the race 1 field site at Terranora in NSW, which was not irrigated. Six of the bacterial isolates tested (25, 26, 2bb, 3b-1, 48 and S-5) and two soilborne isolates of Fusarium oxysporum (Calcutta-1 and K17pi) significantly reduced plant height of cv Lady finger at harvest. Six bacterial isolates (4a, 4b, 84, 8-7, 92 and S-24) and AMF isolate LJS1 had no effect on plant growth. A reduction in plant growth following application of micropropagated banana with microbial inoculants was not observed at the &#145;subtropical&#146; race 4 field testing site that was irrigated. Further research is required to understand the influence of microorganisms applied to nursery grown plants on growth under different environmental and soil conditions when transplanted. The results of this investigation illustrate how selected rhizobacterial and arbuscular mycorrhizal amendments applied to micropropagated banana as a pre-plant treatment in the nursery could be used to enhance plant growth and vigour and reduce disease caused by the fusarium wilt pathogen, thereby improving root health in young plants following transplanting. However, further trials are necessary to determine if these microbial inoculants can be practically produced and applied to commercial operations in field soil conditions to improve root health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300303 Plant Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="subject">620205 Tropical fruit</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensitivity of bovine morulae and blastocysts to heat shock in vitro</field><field name="creator">Naik, Veena</field><field name="description">Bovine pre-implantation embryos are sensitive to high temperatures. The hyperthermia resulting from maternal heat stress leads to an increased loss of early stage embryos. The effects of hyperthermia appear to be more pronounced in the zygote than blastocyst stages. There is also evidence to suggest that B. indicus embryos show better resistance to heat shock as compared to B. taurus embryos. The mechanism of thermotolerance in B. indicus embryos is unknown and it is also unclear if the thermotolerance of these embryos is a result of maternal or paternal contributions. There is also evidence to suggest that male embryos survive heat shock better than female embryos. This research therefore aimed 1. To examine the effect of heat shock on day-7 bovine embryos 2. To study the influence of maternal and paternal genotype on the embryo's ability to survive up to 48 hours post heat shock treatment 3. To study the expression of HSP70 in heat-shocked and non-heat shocked embryos and compare B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. 4. To compare the effects of heat shock on rapidly developing (day-6 morulae) and slowly developing (day-7 morulae) embryos to heat shock treatments 5. To determine the effect of heat shock on the sex ratio of the surviving embryos The work described in this thesis used an in vitro protocol for heat shock studies on embryos, based on observed in vivo rectal temperature fluctuations in heat stressed cows. The first study examined the effects of heat shock on embryos at the morula or blastocyst stage on day 7 of in vitro culture. The embryos were produced in vitro from oocytes collected from ovaries of either pure breed B. indicus or B. taurus and fertilised by frozen semen straws of either B. indicus or B. taurus bulls. Day-7 morulae or blastocysts were used for the study. The embryos were subjected to heat shock (HS) (41.5&amp;degC) or non-heat shock (NHS) (39&amp;degC) temperatures. Embryo survival and development 48 hours (48 h) post treatment were recorded. The data were analysed using binary logistic regression using logit link function to determine the Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence limits for individual factors. The variables used as factors in the analysis were replicate, heat shock, maternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus), paternal genotype (B. indicus vs B. taurus) and stage at which heat shock was applied (morula or blastocyst). The outcome variables used for analysis were the number of viable embryos from the total treated and the proportion reaching expanded or hatched blastocyst stage, and the proportion of male embryos. Heat shock significantly reduced the probability of embryo survival by more than half (OR = 0.47; P &#8804; 0.001) and reduced the probability of the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by almost half (OR = 0.58; P = 0.005) as compared to NHS embryos. The probability of survival of embryos with B. indicus paternal genotype (confounded by the use of a single sire) was double (OR = 2.00; P = 0.002) that of embryos with B. taurus paternal genotype. The heat shock x paternal B. indicus genotype interaction was found to be non-significant. Maternal B. indicus genotype showed no influence on thermotolerance. Nevertheless, the probability of progression to expanded blastocysts for embryos with maternal B. indicus genotypes was double (OR = 2.05; P = 0.030) that of embryos with maternal B. taurus genotype. Comparison of day-7 morulae with day-7 blastocysts showed that the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving until 48 h after treatment was almost two and half times greater (OR = 2.39; P &#8804; 0.001). The probability of survival of a blastocyst with paternal B. indicus genotype was almost twice (OR = 1.95; P = 0.041) when compared to a blastocyst with B. taurus paternal genotype. The interaction term of heat shock &#215; blastocyst stage was found to be significant (OR = 2.70; P = 0.038) indicating that blastocyst stage embryos were resistant to heat shock. The study showed a trend towards survival of more male embryos (61% males vs 39% females) under heat shock conditions (OR = 1.64; P = 0.070) indicating that male embryos may be resistant to heat shock. The second study was designed to detect the induced form of HSP70 in heat shocked and non-heat shocked day-7 bovine embryos and to compare the patterns between B. indicus embryos and B. taurus embryos. Comparison of confocal images showed that staining for HSP70 was present in most embryos whether heat shocked or not and found to be concentrated in the nuclei and cytoplasm. Heat shock appears to have increased HSP70 staining intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, suggesting increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. The same general staining patterns were seen in heat shocked and non-heat shocked embryos of B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. In the third experiment, embryos were examined for the effects of heat shock on day-7 or on day-6 of their in vitro culture. The data were analysed to study the effects of heat shock, stage at heat shock (day-7 blastocysts vs day-7 morulae) and day of heat shock (day-7 vs day-6) on embryo survival and progression to expanded or hatched blastocysts 48 h post treatment. We found that heat shock reduced the probability of survival by more than half (OR = 0.40; P = 0.004). Probability of survival of day-7 embryos (confounded by rapidly developing blastocysts and slow developing morulae) was less than half (OR = 0.36; P = 0.008), that of day-6 embryos. The data were then analysed to study the effects of heat shock on day-7 blastocysts and day-7 morulae for embryo survival post treatment. Heat shock negatively affected embryo survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.007). The probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS and NHS was more than two and a half times greater (OR = 2.71; P = 0.008) than that of day-7 morulae. No interaction of heat shock and blastocyst stage was noticed. Subsequently the effects of heat shock and the effects of the day of heat shock on morula stage embryos were examined. Overall, heat shock reduced the probability of survival (OR = 0.35; P = 0.009) and the probability of embryo development to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.35; P &#8804; 0.001), 48 h post treatment. The probability of day-6 morulae surviving HS and NHS was almost three times higher (OR = 2.81; P = 0.007) than that of day-7 morulae. The interaction of stage of development with heat shock was not significant. We concluded that an embryo that was capable of developing to the blastocyst stage by day-7 or morula stage by day-6 had better survival and higher probability of progressing to expanded or hatched stage when compared to an embryo that had slow development (day-7 morulae). The study showed a significantly different effect of heat shock on the survival of male and female embryos (63% males vs 36% females, OR = 1.79; P = 0.014). In our final study, embryos were produced from three different bulls each of B. indicus or B. taurus genotype. Heat shock effects consistently and negatively affected survival of embryos (OR = 0.29; P &#8804; 0.001) and their ability to progress to the expanded or hatched blastocysts (OR = 0.42; P &#8804; 0.001). Embryos with paternal B. indicus genotype showed no advantage of survival over embryos with paternal B. taurus genotype embryos. When the day-7 blastocysts were compared with the day-7 morulae, the probability of day-7 blastocysts surviving HS or NHS was more than double (OR = 2.23; P = 0.009) that of day-7 morulae. In this study the effect of survival of the interaction term of heat shock treatment with the blastocyst stage was significant and negative (OR = 0.49; P = 0.040). However the interaction term of blastocyst stage x HS for an embryo&#146;s ability to progress to expanded or hatched blastocyst stage was positive (OR = 2.00; P = 0.052), indicating that the embryos that did survive heat shock were capable of continuing their developmental progress. Although more male embryos (55% male vs 45% female) survived heat shock, the effect for this study was non-significant. In summary, the studies described in this thesis successfully tested a new in vitro heat shock protocol based on in vivo temperature changes experienced by heat stressed cows. Heat shock was consistent in negatively affecting embryo survival. Heat shock also negatively affected the embryo's progression to the expanded or hatched blastocyst stage by 48 h post treatment. We observed variable cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for HSP70 in day-7 blastocysts of both B. indicus and B. taurus. This distribution did not change dramatically after heat shock, but staining appeared to be more intense in heat shocked embryos, suggesting that there was increased expression of HSP70 after heat shock. No difference in this pattern was observed between B. indicus and B. taurus embryos. The speed of development of an embryo until being subjected to either heat shock or non heat shock temperatures affected the probability of survival and further development. However, the interaction term of day-7 blastocyst stage and heat shock was inconsistent, meaning that the rate of development appeared to specifically protect against heat shock in some studies while in the other studies, the apparent protective effect extended to control as well as heat shocked embryos. Our study found no significant influence of B. indicus paternal genotype on embryo survival. Our study showed evidence of B. indicus maternal genotype influence on the embryo's ability to progress to expanded blastocysts but not on embryo survival. The study found a clear trend towards an increased proportion of male embryos surviving heat shock conditions. In some studies this was significant, and in others it was not, but the trend was always in the same direction. This suggests that male embryos are more resistant to the effects of heat shock in vitro.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="subject">Sensitivity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158248</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population pharmacokinetics of itraconazole</field><field name="creator">Hennig, Stefanie</field><field name="description">Itraconazole is a triazole antifungal used in the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in paediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplants (BMT). The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of this drug and its active metabolite have been described before; however, there is only sparse information available of the PK properties of this drug in the general paediatric population and CF patients in particular. Even though the target concentrations to obtain treatment success from this drug in ABPA have not been established, therapeutic drug monitoring has been shown to be necessary due to a high interpatient variability and low concentrations reported in these patient groups. The general aim of this thesis was to use modelling approaches to provide a better understanding of the PK of itraconazole, in particular to investigate the relative bioavailability of the two commercial formulations (capsule and oral solution), and to attempt to evaluate relationships between patient characteristics and parameters to enable better individualised therapy to maximise the benefits of this drug. The first study was a paediatric population PK (popPK) investigation of itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxy-itraconazole in CF and BMT patients. All paediatric CF or BMT patients taking oral itraconazole for therapeutic reasons were eligible for the study. A minimum of two blood samples were drawn after the capsules and also after switching to oral solution, or vice versa. Itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole plasma concentrations were measured by a newly developed and validated high-performance liquid chromatography. A nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach (NONMEM 5.1.1) was used to describe the PK of itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole simultaneously. A 1-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination best described itraconazole kinetics, with first order conversion to hydroxy-itraconazole. For itraconazole, the apparent clearance and volume of distribution was 35.5 L/h and 672 L, respectively; the absorption rate constant for the capsule formulation was 0.0901 h&#175;&#185; and for the oral solution formulation it was 0.959 h&#175;&amp;sup1. The relative bioavailability for the capsules was 0.55. Of several screened covariates, only allometrically scaled total body weight significantly improved the fit to the data. No difference between the two populations was found. High inter-patient variability confirmed previous data in CF, leukaemia and BMT patients. From the population model, simulations were performed to develop more adequate dosage regimens to achieve target therapeutic trough plasma concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Higher doses of itraconazole than presently used are needed in these patients, particularly when it is prescribed as capsules. To further support the aims of the thesis, a popPK study with oral itraconazole and its active metabolite in adult patients with CF for capsule and oral solution was performed. A D-optimal study design was developed in MATLAB using POPT v. 2.0, B, which was based on the administration of solution and capsules to 30 patients in a cross-over design. Eight blood samples were taken on two occasions as per the optimal sampling design and assayed by HPLC. NONMEM (5.1.1) was used for the popPK analysis. A total of 241 blood samples were collected, of which 94% were taken within the defined optimal sampling window. A 2-compartment model with first order absorption and elimination best described itraconazole kinetics, with first order formation for metabolism to the hydroxy-metabolite. Absorption rate constants for capsule and solution were 0.0315 h&#175;&#185; and 0.125 h&#175;&#185;, respectively. The comparative bioavailability of the capsule to solution was 0.82 in this study. There was no evidence of nonlinearity in the PK of itraconazole and no screened covariate significantly improved the fit to the data. There was high inter-patient variability confirmed previous results in CF. The optimal design performed well for estimation of model parameters from a complex parent-metabolite popPK model. Due to the sampling windows, most of the samples could be collected within the daily hospital routine, but at times that were &#147;near-optimal&#148; for estimating the popPK parameters. Simulations from the final model showed that the current dosing regimen of 200 mg twice daily would provide a trough target concentration at steady state in only 35% of patients when administered as the solution, and 31% when administered as the capsules. The optimal dosing schedule was 500 mg b.d. for both formulations. Since the therapeutic target for itraconazole, is still unresolved, the potential risks of these dosing schedules need to be assessed on an individual basis. This thesis provides information on several methods and their applications to sparse sampling population pharmacokinetic studies and offers results and future directions to maximize the benefits of itraconazole therapy. The population modelling approach has been successfully applied to both clinical studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320503 Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</field><field name="subject">730101 Infectious diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158258</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vaccine-adjuvant-carrier design against group A streptococcus and human papillomavirus type-16 infection</field><field name="creator">Moyle, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions, with a plethora of vaccines marketed for disease prevention. Most vaccines require parenteral administration, potentially reducing patient compliance due to injection associated pain, as well as requiring administration by trained medical staff. The capacity to deliver vaccines via a mucosal route (e.g. via the nose or mouth) has therefore been subject to a large amount of research. Despite this interest, few mucosal vaccine candidates have successfully progressed to human clinical trials. The attachment of synthetic or bacterial lipids to peptide antigens has been shown to effectively increase the immune response to poorly immunogenic peptide antigens administered via parenteral or mucosal routes. Human clinical trials of lipopeptide vaccines suggest that they in general have a good safety profile, with few or no side effects reported. The lipid core peptide (LCP) system is a lipopeptide vaccine delivery system that incorporates a lipidic adjuvant, carrier, and peptide epitopes into a single molecular entity. The LCPsystem has been demonstrated to adjuvant peptide epitopes from several group A streptococcal (GAS) strains. Antibodies elicited following immunisation with these LCPsystems may potentially protect against challenge with homologous GAS strains. Despite this encouraging data, the LCP-system suffers the inability to be thoroughly characterised, or purified to homogeneity, thus limiting its capacity to be examined in human clinical trials. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop a human-compatible mucosal LCP-based GAS vaccine. The aim of this research was therefore to develop methods for the synthesis of readily characterisable, highly pure LCP-analogues, in decent yield. Techniques that were examined, both in solution and on a solid support, included native chemical ligation and fragment condensation. Both of these techniques suffered from solubility problems. For native chemical ligation, the addition of organic solvents to the ligation mixture helped solubilise species containing the LCP lipid adjuvant, although successful ligation was not observed. The addition of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the ligation mixture however was capable of solubilising lipidic species and enabled successful ligation. The thesis describes the use of this technique for the synthesis of two tri-epitopic GAS LCP-analogues, and a monoepitopic, tetra-valent GAS LCP-system, with the two tri-epitopic LCP-analogues assessed for their capacity to elicit systemic antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Overall, the thesis describes the development of a successful technique for synthesising highly pure, multi-epitopic lipopeptide vaccines for possible use in human clinical trials. In addition, the developed technique should be applicable for the synthesis of lipopeptide vaccines targeting other microorganisms, particularly where a multi-epitopic vaccine approach is warranted. While many studies have examined the LCP-systems capacity to elicit antigen-specific antibodies against attached peptide epitopes, few studies have examined its ability to elicit antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). The ability to elicit antigen-specific CTL responses is important for the development of therapeutic vaccines against viral infections and cancer. Described is the synthesis of a series of LCP-systems incorporating a human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) peptide antigen [HPV-16 E7(44-62)], containing a CTL, Bcell, and T-helper epitope. The vaccines were synthesised in order to investigate their capability to be used for the prevention and/or treatment of HPV-16 associated cervical cancer. Four mannose residues, both in O-acetylated and de-O-acetylated form, were attached to the vaccines to investigate the effect of potential dendritic cell mannose receptor targeting. The vaccines were assessed using a murine HPV-16 tumour model (TC-1 cells). This model demonstrated the capacity of the HPV-16 LCP-systems to reduce or eradicate TC-1 tumours when administered prior to tumour challenge (prophylactic), with mannose containing vaccines exhibiting greater efficacy. Overall, this study suggested that HPV-16 E7(44-62) LCP-systems had the capacity to elicit antigen-specific CTLs capable of clearing HPV-16 associated tumours when administered prior to tumour development. Based on this data, further research should be conducted to examine whether these vaccines are capable of eliminating or reducing the size of developed tumours, why mannose conjugation improved vaccine efficacy, and whether this was due to mannose receptor targeting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158228</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using group learning to promote deep learning, life skills and integration in veterinary science</field><field name="creator">Mills, Paul Christian</field><field name="description">A research-based model of Group Project Work was introduced to encourage deep learning in second-year students enrolled in the School of Veterinary Science (SVS) at The University of Queensland (UQ). The model was developed in response to the concern that students may avoid deep learning strategies in pre-clinical courses of the program particularly if there is little perceived relevance to their chosen career as a veterinary surgeon. The impetus for the development and introduction of Group Project Work was provided by concerns that students may be using superficial learning techniques due to the heavy content and perceived lack of relevance of pre-clinical courses. This was exemplified in the secondyear course, Musculoskeletal Structure and Function, where knowledge taught by traditional approaches did not appear to be satisfactorily retained in later courses of pathology and surgery. It was also apparent that students tended to form small groups to facilitate understanding. However, the traditional approach to structured group learning in medicallyorientated programs involved Problem-Based Learning (PBL) which required substantial resources and presented some concerns about the way students learned and were supported in solving problems. As a result of these concerns, a search of the literature on group learning was conducted. During this research, it was also realised that interactions between students undertaking group learning could engender the development of life skills, such as decision making, teamwork, problem solving and communication skills. These skills have traditionally been considered difficult to 'teach' yet appear to be essential to the successful transition to professional life. The specific structure and formation of groups towards the model of Group Project Work was therefore developed to maximise the group dynamics that would encourage life skills in individual group members. It was understood that group learning was not a novel concept but the specifics of the model, particularly group size and selection of group members, were critical to its success in terms of deep learning and the development of life skills. The small group size of four to five students was substantially lower than PBL groups commonly used in veterinary curricula. More importantly, engineering of group membership based on previous achievement exposed students to differing viewpoints and motivation and, importantly, removed the comfort zone of familiar peer support. This approach was analogous to initial entry into clinical practice and had also been shown to maximise group dynamics. Based on the literature, a model of Group Project Work was developed. An important aspect of model development was to therefore link course content to 'real life' aspects of veterinary clinical practice, which will drive motivation and learning. The model was also developed within the constraints of large class sizes and limited resources in terms of staff and facilities. A highly successful outcome was the integration of students within each cohort, particularly international students. The resultant collegiate atmosphere appeared to support students within each year and motivate appropriate learning strategies. Several iterations of the model have now been implemented with considerable success. Reflections on the learning from this experience have led to enhanced professional knowledge on the application of group work in large veterinary science cohorts and outcomes have been shared with the wider professional community through conference presentations and a number of publications in educational journals. This thesis begins by describing the context of Group Project Work and the concerns that provided the catalyst for this project. A review of the literature consulted then explains the basis of the model that was developed and supports the key features incorporated.

The theory of Aboriginalism is critiqued and interrogated in this thesis in relation to Indigenous Australian women, performance, and race. This thesis addresses the complex and contradictory ways that Aboriginalist discourse fixes non-Indigenous expectations of Indigenous Australian performance, gender, and race by exploring how the performers themselves work within and against these Aboriginalist constructions through their music. One of the immediate effects of Aboriginalism is that it silences Indigenous Australians. In academic discourse and popular media, the voices of Indigenous women who perform contemporary music are rarely heard and often overlooked or ignored. This thesis aims to redress and understand this gender imbalance by focusing on Indigenous women and their contemporary music and illustrate how Indigenous Australian women performers are enacting new types of agency to negotiate their way through, around, and over one-dimensional Aboriginalist constructions of themselves to self-define more positive and diverse identities as Indigenous Australian women. This thesis is divided into four parts. Part One (Chapters One, Two, and Three) provides necessary background to the study. Chapter One introduces the topic and poses research questions in relation to Aboriginalism, Indigenous women, and contemporary performance. Chapter Two examines a number of themes which emerge in the existing literature relating to Indigenous Australian musicians performing contemporary music. Chapter Three locates Indigenous Australian women in this academic discourse and explores some possible reasons for the increasing number of contemporary music recordings by Indigenous Australian women since the 1990s. Part Two (Chapters Four, Five, and Six) positions this study theoretically and methodologically. Chapter Four outlines the theoretical framework that informs this project while Chapter Five discusses the methodological issues and challenges I faced throughout the research process. Chapter Six introduces the Indigenous women performers who took part in this study. This chapter uses the literary convention of a &#147;playlet&#148; by weaving together comments of Indigenous Australian women performers from one-on-one interviews I conducted, media excerpts about the performers, as well as my own questions and comments into a conversation which tells a story about the performers&#146; backgrounds, experiences, albums, and achievements. Part Three (Chapters Seven, Eight, and Nine) comprises the analysis chapters and examines Aboriginalism in relation to race, gender, and performance. Each of these chapters utilise theoretical discussions of Aboriginalism, excerpts from interviews with Indigenous women performers, song texts, and media representations to examine how Indigenous women perform within and against Aboriginalism. Chapter Seven focuses on how Indigenous women performers resist Aboriginalist constructs of race through performance while Chapter Eight turns the gaze to gender and Aboriginalism to explore how the performers challenge Aboriginalist representations of Indigenous women by attempting bring Indigenous women&#146;s experiences, history, and topics to the foreground through song. Chapter Nine examines the way in which Indigenous women performers steer their way through Aboriginalism in music performance by blurring musical boundaries and drawing on a diverse range of musical styles. Finally, Part Four (Chapter Ten) discusses the possibilities of moving beyond Aboriginalism and reflects on my own contribution to discourse concerning Indigenous women performers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">410104 Indigenous Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="subject">751005 Communication across languages and cultures</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158217</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conversation repair and adult acquired hearing impairment</field><field name="creator">Lind, Simon Christopher</field><field name="description">Adults with acquired hearing impairment report that miscommunications and their repair occur with such frequency and severity that they adversely affect their enjoyment of and participation in daily conversation. As a result repair behaviours have become targets of rehabilitation services. However, little is known of the patterns of repair as they are influenced by an acquired hearing impairment, particularly the reliability and validity of the clinical assessment of these behaviours. This thesis reports on three studies into repairs that arose in audio-recordings of free conversation between hearing impaired adults and their chosen frequent communication partners, using the analytic method of Conversation Analysis. The aims of the research were to establish what types of repair were more likely to arise in conversations involving adults with acquired hearing impairment, how these were resolved and whether their occurrence in clinical samples provided reliable and valid images of the same behaviour arising in everyday interactions. In the first study, seven adults with severe or greater acquired hearing impairment each undertook a 20-minute free conversation with their chosen frequent communication partner. Analyses focused on the repair sequences occurring across speaker turns. Only the other-initiated self-repairs initiated by the hearing impaired participant occurred significantly more often than the same sequence initiated by the communication partners. No difference was found in the number of turns taken to resolve repairs when classified by hearing status of the speaker of the repair initiator. Qualitative analysis indicated that the location of the repair initiator in the immediate vicinity of the miscommunicated portion of talk, rather than the content of the repair initiator, provided a cue to the conversation partner about the location of the trouble source. Results suggest certain repair sequences are more likely to be affected by the presence of an acquired hearing impairment than others and that partners work together to efficiently resolve miscommunications. In order to assess the reliability of clinical sampling of repair, four couples, meeting the same criteria as in study one, each undertook four 20-minute conversations over two visits to the clinic in study two. Goodness-of-fit analysis across the four samples for each dyad indicated substantial variation in the number of repairs between dyads, but when samples recorded on the same visit were combined, the resulting 40-minute samples demonstrated substantially greater sampling reliability. In study three, the same four couples who participated in study two audio-recorded two to three hours of conversation in their homes in order to assess the validity of clinical samples. Similar proportions of repairs were initiated in the clinic and home recordings both by the hearing impaired adults and their frequent communication partners. In summary, these two studies indicated that clinical sampling of repair provided useful, reliable and valid images of the same behaviour as it occurred in everyday settings. Together, the three studies demonstrated that acquired hearing impairment influenced the frequency and conduct of certain repair behaviours, and that familiar communication partners successfully used various strategies to resolve miscommunications. These results provide a basis for clinical assessment and intervention for these behaviours.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321025 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Hearing and Speech</field><field name="subject">730111 Hearing, vision, speech and their disorders</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158203</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of bioactive compounds in selected Australian native plants and products</field><field name="creator">Sommano, Sarana</field><field name="description">The bioactive properties of food and their relationship to the maintenance of health and protection from degenerative diseases are receiving much attention from nutritionists and consumers. Eating fruits and vegetables is strongly recommended for good health and a desirable intake of antioxidants. Thus the trend in the food industry is toward producing functional foods with increased levels of bioactive compounds. One of the reasons that Australian native plants have become commercial ingredients is that they personify truly Australian cuisine. There is growing interest in value adding native food plants for local and export markets. There is also an increasing interest in the bioactive components of native plants and as a result identifying a role for native plant foods in the functional food market. However there are a number of commercial issues facing native food producers and food processors in delivering consistent quality products to commercial end users based on a food technology and nutrition platform. Some specific bioactive compounds were measured. Lycopene, &#946;-carotene and ascorbic acid were determined by HPLC. The method for determining lycopene and &#946;-carotene required optimisation. It was found that the accuracy of measurement of lycopene and &#946;-carotene was improved if the sample was finely blended to release the lycopene from the food matrix to maximise extraction. Considerable losses were found during the measurement of ascorbic acid by HPLC. An oxygen quenching agent, sodium metabisulphite, was used to delay the rate of ascorbic acid degradation. The rate of addition at 500 &#956;g/mL was found to be very effective. Moreover, since the degradation kinetics can be expressed as a first order reaction, the rate constant k was calculated for each sample. Since loss of ascorbic acid was still observed during long HPLC sequence runs, the k values were used to extrapolate back to the initial ascorbic acid concentration in the samples. Only Australian native plants currently used as commercial ingredients were selected and used through out the work. These were bush tomato, Kakadu plum, wild lime, finger lime, Davidson&#146;s plum, wattle seed and lemon myrtle. The post harvest and handling procedures of all of those above plants were documented. The information was gathered from the farmers, distributors, representatives of Aboriginal community and from the literature. The samples were also collected and tested for bioactive compounds. It was found that post harvest methods of the native plants had an effect on the survival of bioactive compounds. There are two documented post harvest and handling methods for bush tomato, sun and oven drying. Sun drying seemed to give a better appearance however there was lower survival of bioactive compounds. Most of the native plant fruits are frozen for sale commercially. It was found that for the frozen fruit, the levels of bioactive compounds fluctuated probably due to differences in size and species. Bush tomatoes are one of the most commonly used native fruits and these and other native fruits are frequently made into sauces, chutneys and jams. The stability of bioactive compounds is therefore of importance in these kinds of products. A shelf life study was carried out on bush tomato sauce and chutney. Lycopene was measured in the products together with sensory and colour measurements throughout a period of 9 months. The effect of light and temperature was studied. Lycopene was affected by all of the factors and the study also showed changes in colour and flavour in the products. The behaviour of bioactive compounds during processing was studied. Samples were collected during the production of commercial sauces. Bush tomato ketchup, chutney and Kakadu plum chilli sauce were sampled from the start, middle and the end of the processing run. The samples were tested for specific bioactive compounds; lycopene for bush tomato sauces and ascorbic acid for Kakadu plum sauce. The studies showed that lycopene content was constant through out the run for both bush tomato sauces. Similarly, for the Kakadu plum sauce, ascorbic acid content was constant. However the losses appeared to have taken place prior to the making of the final sauce. The effect of heat processing on bioactive compounds was studied on a laboratory scale product. Formulated bush tomato and Kakadu plum sauces were made in the laboratory and also were tested for specific bioactive compounds. Lycopene content increased by 48 % which can be explained by the release of the lycopene from the food matrix. In contrast, there was a large loss of ascorbic acid in Kakadu plum sauce during the heating process. There are two aspects to the food safety issues in dealing with the use of Australian native plants. First, finding ways to eliminate toxic compounds is essential. For example, it is recommended that bush tomato be collected at the ripe and dried stage when any toxins are at a minimum. Second, during the processing of the products, the critical control points need to be carefully tested in order to protect the products from any contamination. The antioxidant capacity of native plants using DPPH, TEAC and total phenol assays was determined. A positive correlation was found between the DPPH and TEAC assays but not between either of these with total phenol content. Kakadu plum was found to be the most effective antioxidant containing plant. However, the results showed relatively low antioxidant activity in Davidson&#146;s plum even though it contains a high amount of total anthocyanins (polyphenols). This could be due to the colour of the fruit extract interfering with the measurement of antioxidant activity because ABTS radical used in the TEAC assay is purple. LC-MS was used for the analysis of flavonoids and anthocyanins in a number of native plants. Davidson&#146;s plum was analysed differently due to the large amount of anthocyanin detected. A lower cone voltage was found out to give a better anthocyanin M+ molecular ion plus fragment ions for the sequential loss of sugar molecule and finally the anthocyanidin M+ ion. The results shown that 6 anthocyanins were found which are in order of decreasing concentration: delphinidin-hexosepentose, cyanidin-hexose-pentose, petunidin-hexose-pentose, pelargonidin-hexose, peonidin-hexose and malvidin-hexose.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158128</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extrusion of mixtures of starch and encapsulated volatiles</field><field name="creator">Yuliani, Sri</field><field name="description">High temperature, shear and pressure during extrusion can cause a considerable loss of flavour volatiles added in the feed material due to thermal degradation, oxidation, polymerisation or flash distillation. Encapsulating the flavour before extrusion is a promising approach to improve the flavour volatiles&#146; retention during extrusion. &#946;-Cyclodextrin, a truncated cone shaped molecule containing seven glucopyranose units, can provide an excellent protection of flavour through molecular inclusion encapsulation, as the flavour volatile molecules are held inside the hydrophobic cavity of &#946;-cyclodextrin, allowing their high retention. Another encapsulation technique, protein precipitation, is a potential alternative, as &#946;-cyclodextrin is not permitted for food application in some countries. In this technique, flavour is encapsulated in a water insoluble protein based system, providing the flavour with protection against severe damage during extrusion. The capsules incorporated into the feed prior to extrusion also receive the same mixing, heating and shearing as the rest of the feed material during the extrusion process, and their presence may influence the rheological properties of the melt and in turn affect the extrudate properties. Extrusion conditions such as temperature and screw speed can also significantly affect the product quality parameters such as expansion, apparent density, and hardness, as well as affecting the development, retention, and degradation of flavour components. The interaction among those input variables, together with the presence of the capsules in the feed materials can affect the final product properties. The objective of this work was to determine the stability of a model flavour volatile d-limonene encapsulated in both &#946;-cyclodextrin and sodium caseinate capsule when exposed to extrusion conditions, and to determine whether the presence of the capsules and d-limonene affects extruder operation or product characteristics. Two sets of extrusion experiments were carried out in Prism Eurolab KX16 twin screw extruder (16 mm diameter screw; 40:1 L/D ratio) using corn starch as a food matrix. In one set of experiments, d-limonene was encapsulated in &#946;-cyclodextrin. In the other set of experiments, d-limonene was encapsulated with sodium caseinate. Using a Surface Response Methodology, Central Composite Uniform Precision Design, three variables were studied: level of encapsulated ingredient in the feed material (0, 0.01, 2.5, 3.99 and 5%); extruder screw speeds (&#946;-cyclodextrin, 158, 175, 200, 225 and 242 rpm; sodium caseinate, 145, 151, 160, 169 and 175 rpm) and maximum barrel temperatures (&#946;-cyclodextrin, 133, 140, 150, 160 and 167&#176;C; sodium caseinate, 125, 129, 135, 141 and 145&#176;C). Another set of experiment with unencapsulated d-limonene was also performed as a comparison experiment at five levels of d-limonene addition (0.00, 0.07, 0.25, 0.43 and 0.50%), maximum barrel temperatures (125, 128, 135, 142, 145&#176;C) and a screw speed of 160 rpm. In addition, a set of in-line rheometer experiments was carried out to determine the viscosity behaviour of the starch mixture melt as influenced by feed compositions (2.5 and 5% of both capsules addition and 0.25 and 5% of unencapsulated d-limonene addition) at a maximum barrel temperature of 139&#176;C and screw speed of 167 rpm. Measured parameters included extruder operation responses (torque, die pressure, specific mechanical energy [SME], residence time distribution [RTD]), flavour retention and product characteristics (expansion ratio, density, hardness, water absorption index [WAI], water solubility index [WSI] and colour). Extruder operation gave different responses with the variation in feed formulation and extrusion condition. In general, torque and die pressure decreased with the increase in barrel temperature and screw speeds. The presence of capsules modified extruder responses and behaved differently with the type of additives. Incorporating &#946;-cyclodextrin capsules into the feed materials gave a maxima response surface of die pressure, while sodium caseinate capsules exhibited the opposite trend. Minima trends in torque were observed with the addition of sodium caseinate capsule and unencapsulated d-limonene. Barrel temperature, screw speed and capsule level had significant effects on flavour retention and product properties. &#946;-Cyclodextrin capsules gave higher flavour retention (average across 0.01 to 5% levels of addition: 92.2%) than the sodium caseinate capsules (67.5%). Without encapsulation, the flavour retention was very low (average of 8.0%). The retention increased with the increase in capsule level, reached a maximum value at capsule levels of 4.5% and 3.0% for &#946;-cyclodextrin and sodium caseinate capsules, respectively, and then decreased with further increase in capsule level. Without encapsulation, the retention of d-limonene steadily increased with the increase in the level of d-limonene addition. addition. viii A higher radial expansion ratio was observed from the extrudates containing sodium caseinate capsules than those with &#946;-cyclodextrin (average of 1.87 and 1.38, respectively). The expansion ratio responded in the opposite way to flavour retention to increasing levels of encapsulated ingredient addition. The expansion ratio decreased as the capsule level rose to 2.5%, and then went up with the increasing in capsule level from 2.5% to 5% for the sodium caseinate capsules. The expansion ratio of extrudate containing &#946;-cyclodextrin continuously decreased with the increase in capsule level. Extrudates containing unencapsulated d-limonene had the highest expansion ratio (average of 2.1). The presence of capsules enhanced extrudate hardness. &#946;-Cyclodextrin capsules gave the lowest extrudate hardness (average of 1.14 N/mm2), followed by sodium caseinate capsules (average of 2.34 N/mm2) and unencapsulated d-limonene (average of 3.38 N/mm2). These showed that the presence of capsules modified the properties of the extrudates. The presence of capsules, together with the changes in barrel temperatures and screw speeds apparently modified the melt viscosity behaviour possibly through the interaction of starch and capsules, interaction of starch and d-limonene, and lubricating effect of d-limonene released from the capsules to the melt. Power Law models obtained from in-line rheology experiments were applied to predict the viscosity behaviour of the melt with the presence of capsules and unencapsulated d-limonene. It was predicted that an incorporation of 2.5% of sodium caseinate capsules tended to decrease the viscosity, while further increase to 5% resulted in an increase in viscosity. A similar trend of viscosity was also observed in the presence of unencapsulated d-limonene. These results were in agreement with the extruder operation responses and extrudate properties in the presence of sodium caseinate capsules or unencapsulated d-limonene. The presence of &#946;-cyclodextrin capsules tended to decrease the viscosity of the melt, which was not in line with the extruder operation responses and extrudate properties, presumably due to the poor predictability of Power Law model in the case of a mixture containing the &#946;-cyclodextrin capsules. This study enhanced the knowledge in the area of flavour encapsulation for extrusion application. It provided the trends in extruder operation responses, flavour retention and extrudate properties with the changes in capsule type and extrusion conditions. This will allow further development of encapsulation technique and extrusion process to obtain optimum conditions for high flavour retention and desired extrudate properties.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the human brain: adaptive changes associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure</field><field name="creator">Flatscher-Bader, Traute</field><field name="description">Alcohol and tobacco are drugs of abuse which are legal to sell and consume in most western societies. Addiction to these two substances has major social and health implications worldwide. The brain structure known to mediate addictive behaviour is the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system. Dopaminegic neurons arise from the ventral tegmental area, project to the nucleus accumbens and interact with the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic alcoholism elicits marked damage in the prefrontal cortex with significant loss of neurons and glia. The key components of addiction, tolerance and dependence, are thought to be the result of semipermanent adaptive changes in gene expression. Gene expression profiling of the mesocorticolimbic system from human alcoholics and alcohol-dependent animals has revealed highly region-specific alterations. How these molecular changes result in the development of alcohol dependence in humans is not fully understood. Complicating factors in human alcoholism include a high comorbidity with smoking, socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of underlying psychological pathologies. Gene expression profiling of the prefrontal cortex of six alcoholics and six controls resulted in the identification of functional gene groups sensitive to alcoholism. Mitochondrial function was found down regulated while mRNA levels of genes involved in stress response and cell protection were elevated. These results correlate with the pathology of the prefrontal cortex in chronic alcoholism. Some of the control cases used for gene expression profiling were later identified as chronic smokers, while all of the alcoholics were heavy smokers. To date the heavy co-morbidity of alcoholism with smoking has not been taken into account. Thus the expression of selected genes were investigated by realtime PCR in an extended case set of non-smoking alcoholics, smoking alcoholics, smoking non-alcoholics and non-smoking, non-alcoholics. This study revealed that alcoholism itself had a significant impact on the expression of midkine, the high affinity glial glutamate transporter, member 1 and the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3. Heavy smoking itself led to a small but significant elevation of MDK mRNA levels as well as an increase in variation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and metalloproteinase inhibitor, member 3 expression. Apolipoprotein D however was induced by chronic smoking but not by alcohol dependence. These results highlight the need of careful case selection in future studies on gene expression in the human alcoholic brain. Peptide antibodies were produced to midkine and a polyclonal antibody against the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 was obtained from a collaborating laboratory. Western blots utilizing these antibodies revealed a marked increase in midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein in alcoholics compared to non-smoking and non-drinking controls. In coronal sections of human prefrontal cortex of alcoholics and non-smoking non-drinking controls, immunofluorescence of midkine was obtained from nuclei throughout the layers of the cortex and from the cell bodies of a distinct set of astrocytes in cortical layer II. Double staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that a portion of midkine-positive nuclei were localised in glial cells. There was no difference in immunostaining of alcohol and control sections with midkine. In summary these results indicate that midkine protein is induced in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. However, this increase in protein may not be strong enough to be visualised by immunohistochemistry. Midkine induction may be reflective of reparative processes in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in non-alcoholic, non-smoking control cases were obtained as a confluent band in cortical layer II and sparsely in deeper cortical layers. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 immunoreactivity overlapped partially with glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. In chronic alcoholics, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in the area between the cortical layer II and VI was significantly increased. At withdrawal, glutamate levels may reach toxic levels in the cortex. The increase in cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 1 throughout the cortical layers may indicate a protective measure of this brain region in the chronic alcoholic. Additionally, layer specific expression of midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the prefrontal cortex of the healthy individual may implicate a specialised role of these astrocytes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">drug dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158114</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcription factors involved in the regulation of pathogen defence in the plant Arabidopsis</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Kenneth Charles</field><field name="description">Plants are continually exposed to a vast array of pathogens, and generally succeed in defending themselves. An important part of this process is the induction of defence gene products that hinder pathogen growth and delay or prevent disease development. The way in which plants do this is multi-factorial, and includes regulatory proteins known as transcription factors (TFs) which directly regulate the expression of defence-related genes. The expression and activity of these TFs can be differentially regulated by pathogen challenge, as well as following exposure to defence-related signalling molecules such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA). To identify TFs potentially involved in MeJA signalling and plant defence, the expression of all 1,534 putative Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TF genes identified in the genome (at the time) were screened by Real-Time Quantitative PCR (RT-Q-PCR) for altered transcript expression 6 h following either MeJA treatment or inoculation with the incompatible fungal pathogen Alternaria brassicicola. This primary screen identified 134 TF genes that showed a significant change in expression compared to mock-treated plants, and included many genes of previously unknown function belonging to APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF), MYB, WRKY, and NAC TF gene families. Twenty-four of these TF genes were shown to be repressed or induced by MeJA, as well as repressed or induced by A. brassicicola (i.e. co-regulated). A high proportion of these co-regulated genes were members of either the AP2/ERF or WRKY TF gene families. Selected TF genes that showed significant differential regulation following MeJA exposure or A. brassicicola inoculation were profiled in a four-point timecourse over a 24 h period. It was found that the AP2/ERF TF genes identified in the primary screen were the most consistently and reproducibly regulated family of genes. The majority of these regulated TF genes belong to two distinct subclusters of AP2/ERFs in an amino acid based sequence similarity tree, implicating the B3 and B1a subclusters in MeJA signalling and A. brassicicola defence. One gene from each subcluster was chosen for further analysis, based on its consistent pattern of induction by MeJA and A. brassicicola as well as the compatible fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. These two TFs were AtERF2 (B3 cluster) and AtERF4 (B1a cluster). Transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated that stably overexpress the AtERF2 TF gene. Analysis of these plants revealed that this TF is a positive regulator of a subset of MeJA-responsive defence genes encoding the antimicrobial proteins PDF1.2 and CHIB. Additionally, AtERF2-overexpressing lines displayed increased resistance to the fungal pathogen F. oxysporum compared to wild-type plants, as well as enhanced sensitivity to the MeJA-inhibition of root elongation. In contrast to the positive regulation displayed by AtERF2, functional analysis of AtERF4 by both stable overexpression and insertional inactivation in Arabidopsis clearly demonstrated that AtERF4 acts as a negative regulator of the MeJAresponsive expression of PDF1.2. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that AtERF4 acts as a negative regulator of resistance to F. oxysporum and antagonizes the MeJAinhibition of root elongation. Overall, the work undertaken during this PhD has identified two conserved clusters of AP2/ERF TFs with members that display contrasting roles in the regulation of defence gene expression, along with resistance to F. oxysporum and root sensitivity to MeJA. These results suggest that plants co-ordinately express multiple repressor- and activator-type AP2/ERFs during pathogen challenge to modulate defence gene expression and hence the development of disease. By identifying and characterising selected members of the AP2/ERF TF family, this work has provided a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the plant defence response leading to disease resistance. In doing so, it has provided novel tools to assist in the development of pathogen-resistant plants for use by the agricultural industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300301 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158097</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Syntheses and reactions of iminopropadienones, sydnones and oxazinones.</field><field name="creator">Veedu, Rakesh Naduvile</field><field name="description">Iminorpropadienones (R-N=C=C=C=O) 1.2, are a new class of linear cumulenes, usually generated by Flash Vacuum Thermolysis and characterised by IR spectroscopy in low temperature matrices.

Pentafluorophenyl and [alpha]-naphthyliminopropadienones are characterised both by IR and [superscript]13C NMR spectroscopy as they are found to be more stable, and [alpha]-naphthyliminopropadienones can even be isolated at room temperature. Chemical reaction of several iminopropadienones with nucleophiles such as dimethylamine (DMA), diethylamine (DEA) and trimethylamine (TMA) were studied. The analytical FVT experiments provided direct evidence for the nucleophilic attack on both the C=O and N=C moities of the iminopropadienones to give ketenes and ketenimines. Zwitterions were observed in all reactions with TMA. Preparative FVT trapping experiments of 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyliminopropadienones with nucleophiles allowed the isolation of naphthyridones as the stable end product.

Accordingly, there is considerable interest in the mechanisms that regulate normal expression of BRCA1, with a view to elucidating how this could be disrupted in breast cancer. In tumours with reduced BRCA1 protein expression, there can be a concomitant reduction in mRNA level to variable degrees, or no change in mRNA level, suggesting that disruption of multiple different regulatory processes may contribute to BRCA1 down-regulation. Despite this, efforts to date have chiefly focussed on transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the gene, whilst post-transcriptional processes that regulate the dynamics of the BRCA1 transcript, such as decay, localisation and translation efficiency, are poorly understood. Post-transcriptional regulatory pathways are critical for sustaining normal cellular physiology, as evidenced by many examples where disruption of these processes results in disease, including cancer. Regulation of gene expression at this level is often mediated by RNA-binding proteins that recognise specific cis-acting sequence motifs in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of certain messenger RNAs, and recruit, or shield them from macromolecular complexes involved in RNA metabolism, such as the translation apparatus, exosome, and subcellular transport particles. This thesis is centred on investigating post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1. Others have shown that expression of the transcript and protein is regulated throughout the mammalian cell division cycle. Results presented in this thesis suggest that changes in mRNA stability may contribute to cell cycle-dependent expression of BRCA1, and therefore that post-transcriptional regulation of BRCA1 is a biologically-relevant phenomenon. To begin to address the molecular mechanisms involved in regulation of BRCA1 mRNA decay, and possibly other post-transcriptional regulatory processes, the 3&#146;UTR of BRCA1, which had not been previously characterised, was analysed for functional regulatory motifs using a combination of bioinformatics, reporter assays and RNA-proteinbinding analysis. An evolutionarily-conserved 3&#146;UTR subsequence was identified which contains sequence elements capable of regulating reporter activity, and forming complexes with multiple proteins from human epithelial cell lines. Some of these elements have been previously characterised in the context of other genes, including a Hu-antigen R (HuR)-binding motif, adenosine-uridine (AU)- rich sequences and a differentiation control element (DICE). Experiments were also conducted to determine the identities of the RNA-binding proteins detected using an RNA probe containing the 3&#146;UTR elements. A preliminary screen of a small group of RNA-binding proteins with previously-characterised roles in 3&#146;UTR-mediated post-transcriptional gene regulation identified HuR as a negative regulator of BRCA1 protein expression. Interestingly, HuR is over-expressed in breast cancer. Evidence presented in this thesis suggests that the mechanism of HuR-mediated down-regulation of BRCA1 involves direct binding of HuR to the BRCA1 3&#146;UTR, and no changes to mRNA stability or abundance. Finally, proteomics-based analysis of protein extracts enriched with BRCA1 3&#146;UTR RNA-binding proteins yielded several interesting candidates with previously-reported RNA-binding and/or post-transcriptional regulatory activities, including Far upstream element-binding protein 1 (FBP1), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD) and Heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27). This thesis addresses a clear deficiency in the literature concerning regulation of BRCA1, and contributes to our general understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression in mammalian cells. Additionally, the finding that RNA-binding proteins that are over-expressed in breast cancer can negatively regulate BRCA1 expression constitutes important groundwork for identifying potential novel breast cancer therapeutics in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158183</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Child sexual abuse occurrence and outcome: Investigation of prospective longitudinal data for a birth cohort</field><field name="creator">Blakemore, Tamara-Jane</field><field name="description">Child sexual abuse is a widespread social problem found to be associated with detrimental outcomes in both the short and long term. Efforts by researchers to develop comprehensive understandings of the factors and processes associated with abuse occurrence and outcome have been hampered by a lack of consensus across theory and epistemology. The complexity of the problem has also meant that few studies have attempted to examine risk factors for the occurrence of child sexual abuse simultaneously with outcomes. Attending to this observed gap in the literature, this thesis examined the relationship between factors specific to children, their families and social environments, and the occurrence and outcomes of child sexual abuse for participants in an Australian prospective longitudinal cohort study. Guided by a conceptual framework based on concepts from developmental psychopathology, ecological theory and the &#145;Integrated Risk-Sequelae&#146; model of child maltreatment (Higgins &amp; McCabe, 1994), the thesis investigated the hypothesis that sexually abused and non-abused children differ significantly across child, family and environmental factors, and that these differences in context synergistically influence both the occurrence and outcome of child sexual abuse. To clarify these relationships, the study assessed the relative influence of sexual abuse and contextual factors upon child outcomes by exploring the potential of sexual abuse to affect outcomes through both direct and indirect pathways. The data source for the study (de-identified survey data with linked child protection information) provided a unique life course perspective on the experiences of sexually abused children, and in contrast to other studies, enabled a wide range of contextual factors to be investigated as potential risk factors for the occurrence of child sexual abuse and its outcome or sequelae over time. The study finds that when compared to their non-abused counterparts, sexually abused children experience greater vulnerability and disadvantage across multiple aspects and phases of their life. While mothers of sexually abused children report significantly higher rates of child problems when compared to mothers of non-abused children, no significant differences exist between sexually abused and non-abused children&#146;s self report of social, emotional and behavioural outcomes. Examination of the relationship between contextual factors and sexual abuse confirm the hypothesis that observed differences between the contextual domains of sexually abused and non-abused children are associated with increased risk for both the occurrence and outcome of child sexual abuse. Assessment of the relative influence of sexual abuse and contextual factors upon maternal and child self-reported outcomes for all children, finds that when the effect of contextual factors is taken into account, sexual abuse does not make a significant contribution to report of child health outcomes. Exploration of the potential for sexual abuse to affect outcomes through indirect pathways finds little support for the presence or operation of moderation or confounding effects, but does find considerable support for the proposition that contextual factors mediate the relation between sexual abuse maternal reports of child outcome. This thesis also finds that factors specific to the sexual abuse experience are significantly associated with sexually abused children&#146;s self-reported outcomes even when the effects of contextual factors are considered. This effect does not hold for maternal report of child outcomes, suggesting that while contextual factors exert a strong influence on maternal-reported outcomes, characteristics of the sexual abuse experience, rather than the sexual abuse itself, may be an important influence on sexually abused children&#146;s self reported outcomes. Collectively, the findings of this thesis suggest that the occurrence and outcomes of child sexual abuse exist as a function of multiple factors that operate via dynamic processes or mechanisms over time. The study is unique in the Australian context and makes several important findings that add to the knowledge base for child sexual abuse.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370200 Social Work</field><field name="subject">750312 Youth/child development and welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158085</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An architecture for ubiquitous mobile service delivery</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Paul Francis</field><field name="description">Highly mobile people (HMPs) require flexible, reactive service delivery due to their regularly changing location and activities and the lack of a wired network connection. A mobile service delivery system should be able to detect relevant events that occur such as change of location, availability of new last-minute specials, sales opportunities and safety issues and then reactively take action in response to these events. This work describes a situation management ontology based framework for delivering such a system. Issues addressed include HMP and service states and events, context, situations and situation-action rules, and syntactically and semantically compatible XML ontologies for their specification. A generic situation management ontology is developed in OWL using the ontology development tool, Prot&#233;g&#233;. This ontology is combined with domain specific classes in the travel domain to create a travel situation management ontology that can be used as the basis for a ubiquitous mobile travel service application. Using a typical independent traveller scenario, the travel situation management ontology is instantiated to demonstrate its effectiveness. The flexibility of the generic situation management ontology is demonstrated by creating an academic situation management ontology by simply replacing a small number of domain specific classes. A framework is also proposed that is based on the situation management ontology, distributed, co-operating software agents, and context based filtering, and is suitable for mobile service delivery. The example framework uses the situation management ontologies developed in this work and action rules to link situation specification to situation detection and action. The ontologies and action rules are semantically consistent and are specified in the XML based, industry standard language, OWL, thus drawing together previous independent work in a number of diverse disciplines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280104 Computer-Human Interaction</field><field name="subject">280201 Expert Systems</field><field name="subject">700102 Application tools and system utilities</field><field name="subject">350599 Tourism not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">710599 Tourism not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158143</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Not blind enough: Living in the borderland called legal blindness</field><field name="creator">Omansky, Beth Fay</field><field name="description">This qualitative study explored the experiences of people categorised as legally blind. Adopting a phenomenological approach, the study gathered four life stories of three recruited participants and my own story as a legally blind person. These case studies revealed that people who are legally blind traverse a borderland between sighted and blind worlds, a position which carries with it experiences that are vastly different than both totally blind and sighted people. Located in disability studies, the thesis examined the experience of legal blindness in a unique way, cross-fertilising the best elements of an American cultural studies approach with a British social model of disability. The British social model, rooted in sociological materialist analysis, is often positioned by its proponents as at odds with the United States humanities-based cultural or minority model of disability. This thesis sought to discover if a bridge could be built between the two models to allow for several theoretical analyses with the higher goal of understanding both phenomenological and social aspects of borderland blindness. Another original aspect of this study is the use of the postmodern metaphor &#147;borderland&#148; to carve out a geographical space unique to legal blindness -- a territory between sightedness and blindness where residents are pressed to migrate back and forth across its borders from situation to situation. The research developed a combination of social constructionism, materialism, postmodernism, and existential phenomenology, while aiming to meet the goals of emancipatory disability research. Participants told their stories in their own words, they chose what was important for us to know about them, and they maintained control over their stories throughout the research and write-up processes. The study was interested in how society treats blind people, and was also keen to know what meaning blind people made of such treatment. Its design strayed from orthodox disability studies research in that it wanted to learn and record the embodied experience of legal blindness as well as blindness identity formation. However, to examine physical aspects of blindness did not imply approval of ocularcentric medical model practices; both the American and British social models have at their foundations critical analyses of medicine&#146;s control over the lives of disabled people. While this study utilised social constructionism as a primary method of analysis, it simultaneously challenged the binary of essentialism/social constructionism because impairment, disablement, and disability are complex and do not all fit into either stance. The experience of impairment is integral to understanding the lived experience of blindness. Further, the study rejected the blindness/sightedness binary which positions blindness as &#145;lack&#146; (Michalko, 1999), and instead, examined borderland blindness as a medically and legally constructed social category that is neither better nor worse than &#145;normal&#146; sight and vision, but is merely neutral difference. The research was conducted from an &#145;insider&#146; position because I wanted to learn how other legally blind people experience life in the borderland; and, in the tradition of disability studies and disability activism, I consider this work a political act -- &#147;a commitment to openly partisan inquiry&#148; (Barnes and Mercer, 2004). I was curious to explore the strengths, weaknesses, and complexities of conducting research as an &#147;insider&#148; &#150; as a member of the population of research interest. Another feature of this study was the application of Rogerian techniques of establishing an environment in which genuineness, trust, and unconditional positive regard would flourish; this model provided a natural marriage to emancipatory life story and insider research. The research findings conclude that there is no conflict between British and American social models of disability; and further argue that the two models enhance each other in that together they provide a more holistic examination of the everyday lived experience of disabled people. Use of both models strengthened inherent weaknesses that arise when each model stands alone. Furthermore, the findings suggest that more studies about blindness concentrate on &#147;legal&#148; or borderland blindness because this population has experiences that are vastly different from both totally blind and sighted people. These differences have significant ramifications for education, rehabilitation and other human service policy and provision.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750305 Ability and disability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158179</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of collaboration: a study of the influences of violinists on the violin repertoire of Sergei Prokofiev.</field><field name="creator">Maddick, Andrew Flannigan</field><field name="description">This critical commentary examines the process of composer-performer collaboration in the violin works of Sergei Prokofiev.

It explores the relationship between composer Joseph Twist and myself as a violinist, specifically relating to the work performed in my final recital in March 2005, and allows me to experience first hand the composer-performer dynamic and compare my experience with those I have researched.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158123</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence and the performer in the flute works of Toru Takemitsu (1930-1996)</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Alexis Fleurina</field><field name="description">Toru Takemitsu (1930-1996) is Japan&#146;s most internationally celebrated composer to date. He possessed a unique musical voice, a hybrid of Eastern philosophy and Western technique. Takemitsu made extensive use of silence in his compositions, treating the absence of sound as an active element in the musical narrative. He was deeply and personally affected by the philosophical bases pertaining to traditional Japanese music. This had a profound influence on his worldview. The following critical commentary was instigated as a result of performance-related questions and includes the role of the performer with respect to silence. It aims to enlighten the thesis that silence in Takemitsu&#146;s works functions as an invitation to contemplation both for the listener and performer in a process which requires exploration, discovery and imagination. In outlining Takemitsu&#146;s worldview, a brief biographical account is included in order to establish context, followed by a survey of influences, primarily focusing on Eastern philosophies. Additionally, the formulation of the Japanese philosophical concept of &#147;ma&#148; and its development in relation to music as it pertains directly to the execution of silence will be discussed. Following the examination of three flute works, the role of the performer including traditional perspectives, contemporary flautists&#146; views, as well as fundamental attitudes towards performance will be explored. The present study is concerned with Takemitsu&#146;s concert music, as an investigation into his prolific film soundtrack output and popular arranging is beyond the scope of this paper.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158180</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling thickness in a stratiform deposit using joint simulation techniques</field><field name="creator">Eggins, Ronald George</field><field name="description">The estimated economic value of a stratiform mineral deposit is often very sensitive to the modelling of thickness in a conformable sequence of beds. A coregionalisation model of thickness expresses the assumed underlying spatial relationships of bedding thickness on a regional scale. Joint simulation of thickness directly models the cross-correlation of bedding thickness in such a model. Many of the current techniques of joint simulation are limited in the number of variables that can be simulated due to the multiplicative increase in processing times, based on the number of variables and number of samples simulated. To minimise processing times some methods make use of simplifying assumptions on the coregionalisation model. For example the Markov model, in which the dependence of one variable on the other is limited to the collocated data, would be unlikely to apply to the thickness of conformable bedding in a stratiform deposit. Transforming the thickness variables to remove correlation, simulating, and then back transforming to original data space offered a possible solution. The Minimum/Maximum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF) technique was chosen as one most likely to successfully decorrelate numbers of thickness variables, if the assumptions regarding a two-structure linear coregionalisation model were reasonably satisfied by the sampled data. The assumptions are that a simple intrinsic model of coregionalisation can represent both a lower correlation (&#145;noise&#146;) component and a higher correlation (&#145;signal&#146;) component of the modelled data. This implies that the final coregionalisation model (noise plus signal) is made up of linear combinations of a single basic structure at different spatial scales. In a number of previous applications, this had not proved to be a particularly restrictive requirement of the model. The decorrelated variables can be independently simulated, and back transformed twice; firstly using a MAF back-transformation to obtain correlated Gaussian variables, and finally to original data space. The McArthur River silver/lead/zinc stratiform deposit in the Northern Territory of Australia was chosen as the case study because it had many of the characteristics needed to test and evaluate the MAF technique in a typical stratiform deposit. The orebody model contained seventeen (17) mineralised units forming a conformable sequence which had varying thickness and degrees of mineralisation, and which had good continuity across the deposit. Cross-correlation between the thicknesses of the seventeen stratigraphic units was significant. The deposit was heavily folded in certain areas and true thickness of the bedding was calculated from drillhole log data, and used for the simulation studies. A simple unfolding algorithm was utilised to effectively flatten the deposit to allow the application of 2-D simulation techniques. Drillhole intersections often did not contain the full stratigraphic sequence of beds due to a series of normal faults criss-crossing the deposit. Therefore, incomplete data in the drillhole would need to be removed from the data set, or the number of beds in the joint simulation would need to be reduced, to utilise the MAF technique. A method was developed and validated for the generation of missing thicknesses at a sample point which removed the requirement to delete real incomplete sub-sets of the data when utilising MAF. Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS) was used to simulate the MAF decorrelated variables under the assumption that the multi-Gaussian assumptions held. Bedding surface simulations were generated by the addition of true thickness perpendicular to a basal reference surface. The 2-D joint simulations of thicknesses and surfaces were considered successful within a domain of the deposit where drillholes were approximately perpendicular to bedding after unfolding. The univariate, bivariate and spatial statistics of the original thickness data were reproduced accurately in the joint simulation model, including the crossvariograms of original thickness; especially compared to those obtained using independent simulation of thickness. It was concluded that the techniques could be successfully applied to other stratiform deposits if the recommended validation steps were carried out. No further difficulties should be encountered in applying the method to 2-D joint simulation of grades in a stratiform deposit. The full 3-D joint simulation of variables in any deposit using MAF would be assisted by the technique to generate missing variables at a point.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260100 Geology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158312</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology of the South East Bowen Basin, South East Queensland, Australia, Implications for groundwater resources in the Kalahari basin of Botswana</field><field name="creator">Lasarwe, Reneilwe</field><field name="description">Sedimentary deposits are important aquifers in many parts of the world and in order to explore, develop and manage these aquifers, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the hydrogeologic properties and sedimentary facies (aquifer characterization). Within a sedimentary hydrogeologic system, the environment of deposition and the resulting distribution of grain sizes, texture, and facies associations within different individual aquifer bodies influence variations in hydraulic properties. Successful prediction of the quality of the aquifer is dependent on the accurate mapping of both lithologic units and hydrogeologic parameters. In this project, the influence of petrophysical characteristics of the sedimentary rocks to the quality of the aquifer is investigated with a view to finding a correlation between these characteristics, the type and nature of sedimentary rocks present and their hydrogeologic properties. Investigation methods involved the use of geophysical wireline log data, lithological core logging, thin section microscopy and X-Ray Diffraction analysis. All this was done to characterize the sedimentary rocks in terms of composition, grain size and diagenesis. Porosity tests were also performed on the samples collected while permeability data was collected from the Department of Natural Resources and Mines (DNR &amp; M), Australia. The basins of interest for this project are the Bowen Basin in Australia and the Kalahari Basin in Botswana. The two basins are similar, though structurally different. The basins are similar in the sense that they have got similarity in their rock sequence. All the work done on the Bowen Basin and the results obtained are extrapolated to the similar Kalahari Basin. The units of the Bowen Basin are underlain by the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian Camboon Volcanics. The Permian units include the Buffel, Barfield, Flat Top, and Gyranda Formations and the Baralaba Coal Measures. The Triassic units are the Rewan Group, Clematis Sandstone and Moolayember Formation. Within the Bowen Basin the Permian units are generally argillaceous and therefore have generally low porosities and permeabilities and also give low resistivity (RES) base lines and high gamma ray (GR) baselines. However where fractured, the units yield some water from the shale. Boreholes drawing water from the Barfield, Flat Top and Gyranda Formations tap the fractured shales. The Triassic aquifers present a different picture. The best aquifers with high porosities and permeabilities are of the Triassic age and their distribution is influenced by their proximity to the source area. Sedimentary rocks of the Triassic age in the Bowen Basin become more argillaceous at more distal positions from the source area. The Rewan Group in particular shows this trend and hence better aquifers within the Rewan are those close to the source area. The Kalahari Basin Karoo stratigraphy commences with the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian glaciogenic sedimentary rocks of the Dwyka Group. The Dwyka Group is overlain by the argillaceous Permian to Early Triassic sedimentary rocks of The Ecca Group and the Beaufort Group. Overlying the Beaufort Group is the Lebung Group (lower Mosolotsane Formation-dominantly mudstone and siltstone sequence and upper Ntane Sandstone Formation- aeolian sandstone). Basaltic lavas of the stormberg Lava Group cap the Karoo stratigraphy. Few groundwater studies in the Karoo of the Kalahari Basin have shown that the Ecca Group does not posses good aquifer characteristics because of its argillaceous nature. However, thin arenaceous interbeds within the Ecca Group have yielded some groundwater. Non-measurable quantities of groundwater have been recorded from boreholes sunk in the Beaufort Group. Few boreholes penetrating the Mosolotsane Formation yielded very little groundwater whereas Ntane Sandstone have yielded a fair amount of groundwater. Groundwater yield from the Stormberg Lava Group is related to the presence of fractures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260501 Groundwater Hydrology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158198</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Handwriting of eight year old children with and without autistic spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Cartmill, Linda Joan</field><field name="description">Anecdotally it was found that Queensland occupational therapists reported a surprisingly high referral rate for handwriting problems amongst school aged children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A subsequent review of the literature revealed a number of anecdotal reports of disordered handwriting in this population but limited research in the area. This thesis presents a descriptive and exploratory study of the nature of handwriting in eight year old children with and without ASD. Issues of handwriting development and motor learning are canvassed followed by an examination of concepts of motor control. Next follows a review of current handwriting models. The Systems Model of Handwriting was proposed as a response to the evidence for both dynamic and motor programme aspects of handwriting. Using this model as an organizing structure, the literature on ASD and handwriting was then examined which led to the framing of three research questions: 1. Is the handwriting speed of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 2. Is the handwriting legibility of children with ASD significantly different from that of children without ASD? 3. At what stage/s of the Sequential Handwriting Process, is the handwriting of children with ASD different from that of children without ASD? Twenty-eight eight year old children with ASD and a matched control group of twentyeight comparison children were recruited from state primary schools in Brisbane and surrounding areas. These fifty-six children were assessed on thirteen handwriting process variables and two handwriting outcome variables in order to answer the research questions. Data produced were analyzed primarily with t-tests for between group differences and by examination of correlations between process and outcome variables. Small but measurable differences were found in both speed and legibility between the two groups, with the handwriting of the children with ASD being both less legible (t=- 2.47, df=54, p=0.02) and slower (t=-2.47, df=54, p=0.02). Accuracy of letter formation was also found to be significantly worse for the children with ASD compared to children in the control group (t=3.53, df=54, p=0.001). Further, the two groups were found to differ in some aspects of the Sequential Handwriting Process. Specifically, the children with ASD showed significant correlations between legibility and Perceiving, Conceptualizing and Planning stages, while the comparison children showed significant correlations between legibility and Interpreting, Conceptualizing, Planning and Activating stages. Only one process variable (consistency of letter formation) showed a moderate correlation with handwriting speed &#150; all other variables were of only slight to fair strength. Finally, the implications of the research findings are discussed, limitations described and directions for future research canvassed. As a result of the present study, a revised Systems Model of Handwriting is proposed. Several recommendations for occupational therapy intervention in handwriting practices in the classroom are made, notably: clear and focussed initial tuition of letter formation and secondly, the development of automaticity of the handwriting skill.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158068</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of word order in Chinese as a foreign language: An error taxonomy</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Wenying Wendy</field><field name="description">Research in the field of Chinese second/foreign language (L2) acquisition, at present, does not match the increasing demand to learn Chinese as an L2, given that Chinese is the fastest growing foreign language (FL) in countries such as Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada and Australia. There is a significant gap between Chinese L2 acquisition research and the large body of literature in second language acquisition (SLA), which mainly focuses on English L2. The need for more research in Chinese SLA is compelling. Particularly, research in Chinese L2 word order acquisition requires more attention because word order plays a more complex role in Chinese than in English. Chinese relies heavily on word order for information structuring of a sentence because this language lacks other means, such as verb endings indicating tense and aspect, to accomplish this function. Due to the different roles word order plays in Chinese and English, adult English-speaking learners find Chinese word order acquisition very challenging. Chinese L2 word order errors frequently occur in learners&#146; L2 production. However, Chinese L2 researchers and teachers are left with no means to adequately describe and explain these errors for instruction purposes. This dissertation develops such a means &#151; a comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese L2 word order errors. This taxonomy organizes these errors into a logical system of classification. Through the classification, explicit description of various Chinese L2 word order errors is achieved, and specific sources of these errors are traced. Data was collected from 116 native-English-speaking learners of Chinese at a large university in Australia. The Chinese L2 learners were divided into three proficiency levels based on their institutional status. Four hundred and eight word order errors were extracted by qualitatively analyzing the learners&#146; written samples. Among the 408 word order errors, 404 (99%) are successfully classified into different categories according to a new criterion proposed in this dissertation. The new taxonomy provides a principle-based description and explanation of various Chinese L2 word order errors. A word order error is deemed to constitute an error when it violates a relevant word order principle (or sub-principle). These principles not only explain why an error is an error but also provide a means for correcting the error. In a pedagogical sense, the directness and explicitness in explaining word order errors achieved by employing this taxonomy cannot be achieved by relying on any other sources of errors available in the literature. The new taxonomy overcomes the limitations of existing taxonomies in the literature that are either superficial, or unsystematic, or not empirically testable. For example, it draws on the Cognitive Functionalist Approach of L2 acquisition. Both its description and explanation of Chinese L2 word errors go beyond superficiality. The approach maintains that adult L2 learners&#146; conceptualization of the world is initially based on their L1. Their conceptualization of the world imposes constraints on the linguistic structures of their L2. Therefore, errors may occur when English learners of Chinese impose their conceptualization based on the English language onto the Chinese structures. The new taxonomy is systematic because it categorizes word order errors using one criterion. New categories emerging from the data and the existing categories from the literature are incorporated into one system. Finally, the new taxonomy is empirically testable because many new categories emerged from the data. It is an open-ended rather than a closed system. New categories can be added as necessary. The dissertation finds that violation of relevant word order principles has a high explanatory value for the various word order errors encountered in the data. This has clear pedagogical implications. Chinese L2 learners generally lack awareness of the word order principles (and sub-principles) on which the new taxonomy is based. These principles and sub-principles are seen to be of considerable importance to the acquisition of Chinese L2 word order. In order to improve learners&#146; word order performance, the results of this study indicate that it is imperative for the basic Chinese word order principles be included in a CFL curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158129</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the physical fertility of bauxite residue with different textural and structural conditions</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Simon James</field><field name="description">Bauxite mining and alumina processing in Gove, northern Australia, produces residues that contain significant quantities of sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and sodium aluminate, making the material highly alkaline, saline, and sodic. In an untreated condition these residues are incapable of supporting plant growth, and if left exposed and unstabilised they are highly susceptible to wind and water erosion, presenting a hazard to both man and the environment. Covering these wastes, preferably with vegetation that is native to the area, is therefore considered desirable. The current method of dry stacking bauxite residue necessitates separation into fine grained red mud (RM) and coarse grained residue sand (RS). Adverse chemical properties of RM inhibit plant growth, but moderately successful plant growth has been obtained in ameliorated (seawater neutralised/freshwater leached) RS, where the limitations are largely associated with water stress during the post-monsoon dry season. The water storage capacity of RS can be improved by increasing its fines content, but this can have a detrimental impact on other physical properties of the bauxite residue that are important for vegetative growth. This project aims to determine what effect increasing the fines content of RS has on the physical properties of bauxite residues, by assessing the suitability of various mixtures of RS and RM for supporting plant growth. Two distinctly different textured bauxite residues dominated by silt (RMsilt) and clay (RMclay) particles, were separated from RM by sedimentation and then ameliorated to reduce pH 1:5 to 8.8, electrical conductivity 1:5 &lt; 412 &#181;Scm-1, and Na + &lt; 28 cmolckg-1. The RMsilt and RMclay materials were then added to RS at different ratios to create a range of clay (RS/RMclay) dominated mixtures; silt (RS/RMsilt) dominated mixtures; plus an equivalently textured RM. The effect of texture and structure on plant available water capacity (PAWC), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and penetration resistance (Pr) was assessed. Structure of puddled mixtures was altered using both crushing (&lt; 2 mm) to simulate thorough tillage, and wetting and drying cycles for consolidation. The PAWC of bauxite residue was not significantly improved until fines content (silt + clay) was increased from 6 % in RS, to 39 % and 62 % in the RS/RMclay and RS/RMsilt mixtures respectively. Increasing the fines content of RS altered the void ratios of the mixtures, changing the pore size distribution from being dominated by large micro-pores in coarse mixtures to be dominated by smaller micro-pores in finer mixtures, which resulted in negligible change in PAWC of coarser textures. Crushing and consolidation increased water storage at potentials of -0.1 to -10 kPa, with negligible effect on PAWC and water storage at lower water potentials. The PAWC of puddled RM was not greater than that of RS, but in crushed RM the PAWC was twice that of RS. The Ksat of mixtures tended to decrease as fines content increased, but increased with level of disturbance. In puddled mixtures Ksat was lowest (mean 0.52 mmh-1) and whilst not shown to be significant, Ksat seemed to be closely associated to packing density and void characteristics of the mixtures. Subjecting puddled materials to successive weathering cycles caused the samples to expand and crack increasing the Ksat of over half the textures by more than an order of magnitude. Crushing increased Ksat of all samples as water movement was no longer restricted to smaller inter-particle voids, but instead capable of moving through larger cracks and around secondary particles and aggregates. Wetting and drying of these crushed samples caused consolidation of particles, reducing Ksat due to the increased tortuousity. A quantitative measure of Ksat after wetting and drying cycles was not able to be attained in these experiments due to insufficient sample size. In puddled mixtures the penetrability at field capacity and wilting point was affected by packing of particles, wherein Pr increased with decreasing void ratio. Increasing the fines content of RS by only a small amount (13-15 %) resulted in a more than 6 fold increase in Pr of puddled mixtures. The Pr of all puddled mixtures other than RS was much higher than the penetrability considered highly restrictive to root elongation (2.0 MPa). This was substantially lower (up to 96%) in the crushed treatments, regardless of texture, and considered favorable to root growth, which suggests that a vital criterion for successful vegetation growth in neutralised bauxite residues is the breaking up of the massive structure. This work concluded that through drying and crushing is a prerequisite for plant growth in bauxite residues and that improvements in soil water availability are only identifiable in the RS when the fines content is increased substantially. To achieve successful plant establishment and sustainable vegetation cover it is recommended that deep ripping and thorough cultivation of puddled bauxite residues be carried out initially prior to propagation in order to improve water infiltration, reduce erodability, and facilitate root elongation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158190</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of uterine cervical conformation in tropically adapted beef cattle</field><field name="creator">Finch, Tricia Maree</field><field name="description">A large proportion of the beef industry in northern Australia is composed of tropically adapted cattle, due to their propensity for tick and drought resistance. It has been suggested that a large conical cervix is responsible for decreased fertility in these cattle where a conical cervix is defined as having a caudal to cranial cervical diameter difference of greater than 15 mm. Studies were conducted in order to ascertain the incidence of conical cervix and the heritability of cervical diameter in tropically adapted beef cattle in Queensland. An initial study was conducted on 246 Santa Gertrudis females from four properties. Caudal and cranial cervical measurements were taken with transrectal B-mode ultrasound using the Aloka SSD_500 scanner and a 5 MHz linear probe. Analysis of data was by AS REML, including the effects of sire, parity and property. Sire was included as a random effect, whereas parity and property were included in the analysis as fixed effects. Sire effects were significant. A sire model was used to calculate a heritability estimate of 0.60 &#177; 0.27 for uterine cervical diameter. An analysis of variance showed that parity had a significant effect on cervical diameter, with cervical diameter increasing as parity level increased. Property had no effect on cervical diameter A more detailed study was conducted on 850 cattle from five properties. Breeds represented were Santa Gertrudis, Brahman, Brahman Cross, Belmont Red and Belmond Red Cross. Caudal and cranial cervical diameter, sire, parity and breed were recorded for each animal. Once again, sire effects were significant resulting in a heritability estimate of 0.46 &#177; 0.15. An analysis of variance showed parity effects to be significant (&#945;=0.05) while property and breed effects did not influence cervical diameter. However property and breed were heavily confounded due to the practice of many stud breeders of running one breed per property. Breed and parity were also heavily confounded as Santa Gertrudis breed cattle were the only cattle available that had already produced one or more calves. In order to examine the relationship between cervical diameter and liveweight, a subset of 568 cows from the above group also had their weight in kilograms recorded. Animals were chosen for this study based on the availability of scales at each property. A Pearson correlation test resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.043 between uterine cervical diameter and animal liveweight. This demonstrates that there is a negligible linear relationship between cervical diameter and liveweight. The relationship between cervix diameter and calving outcome was not investigated in this study. Although calving records were obtained for a number of animals in this study, many variables affecting calving outcome could not be accounted for such as disease outbreaks, artificial insemination technique and other management factors. Previous studies have suggested a relationship between cervical diameter and infertility but the present study was unable to draw conclusions regarding this. Although this study has shown that uterine cervical diameter is a moderately to highly heritable trait, it is not recommended that producers cull animals based on their uterine cervical dimensions at this stage, as the relationship between uterine cervical diameter and fertility is still poorly understood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">300402 Animal Reproduction</field><field name="subject">630103 Beef cattle</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158319</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the development of a talent identification and development program for coaches</field><field name="creator">O'Keeffe, Erin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Coach retention is a significant problem for sport at all levels. Coach turnover, especially of talented and experienced coaches, creates a multitude of operational complexities for many sport organisations. The importance of having quality coaches available to assist the development of high performing athletes has been identified by both sports administrators and elite athletes. However, the data indicate that in Australia, coach accreditation rates are decreasing by more than 9% each year (ASC, 2004). Although programs focusing on coach education and pathways have been developed, minimal research has addressed the elements involved in identifying and retaining talented coaches. The first step in developing a coach talent identification and development program is the formulation of a definition of coaching talent. Although definitions of 'talent' exist in the business and sport performance arenas, these are not directly applicable to the sport coaching context. This study used a multi-method approach through the combination of interviews and questionnaires to develop a comprehensive definition of a talented coach. Two research questions were addressed: What are the attributes of a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? What are the factors that identify a talented coach (and do perceptions of these differ between different stakeholders)? Information gathered from interviews with experienced personnel in sport (seven coaches and administrators and two senior athletes) was transcribed and coded using open, axial and reflective coding. Themes identified in the analysis were incorporated with the literature to inform construction of the Talent in Coaching Questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 100 items investigating three separate but related areas: Demographic Intbrmation (10 items); Attributes of a Talented Coach (77 items); and Identification of a Talented Coach (13 items). Within the Attributes of a Talented Coach section, items were allocated six different categories: Background (10 items); Knowledge (1 3 items); Athlete-Coach Interaction (1 1 items); Operational Practices (12 items); Motivation (7 items); and Attributes (24 items). TWO areas were addressed in the Talent Identification section: the populations in which a talented coach could be found (6 items) and the best possible selection methods to identify a talented coach (7 items). Items were answered using a 5-point Likert scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. The Talent in Coaching Questionnaire was piloted with nine experienced sport personnel and 21 high performing athletics coaches to obtain feedback on face validity, ease of understanding and readability prior to delivery to 300 coaches and administrators across Queensland. The sample incorporated beginner, experienced, retired and lapsed coaches fiom individual and team sports at club, state and national levels. Administrators were defined as involved in the coordination of coaching and support services at club, state or national level. Subjects were sourced fiom 38 different sports through their respective State Sporting Organisations. Within the time fiame allowed, 162 questionnaires were received (54% response rate), which included responses fiom 32 different sports. The sample comprised 27.7% female and 72.3% male subjects, 66.7% of whom were over the age of 40. Using SPSS, the data were analyzed through descriptive statistics, reliability and factor analysis, ANOVA, and Chi square. Items and categories were ranked according to the mean score fiom all participants. The top five attributes of a talented coach were considered to be an individual who; is aware of the individual differences among athletes (mean = 4.74), has an enjoyment of coaching (mean = 4.71), is always looking for improvement in his / her coaching (mean = 4-70), is willing to learn (mean = 4-69), and has knowledge of the fundamental skills required for the sport (mean = 4.65). Attributes considered less important in a talented coach were; one who is motivated by money (mean = 1-70), introverted (mean = 2.38), makes the athlete the first priority in life (mean = 2.42), has received awards for coaching (mean = 2.92) and coached as a head coach (mean = 2.40), State coach (mean = 2.96), or National coach (mean = 2.83). Results suggest that a talented coach may be found among those individuals already coaching or retiring athletes and may be effectively identified through observation at training and competition, possibly through the use of a talent scout. Significant differences were found when item scores were compared by age, gender, experience, and qualifications (National Coaching Accreditation Scheme). Female coaches considered nurturing and teaching attributes more important than did males, additionally career stage may affect consideration of the most important attributes.

While the potential monetary savings for nitrogen removal via nitrite are significant, the difficulty lies in achieving specific inhibition or removal of the nitrite oxidising bacteria (NOB; those that oxidise nitrite to nitrate) whilst retaining ammonia oxidising bacteria (AOB; those that oxidise ammonia to nitrite). In approaching this general problem, characterisation of NOBs (both Nitrobacter and Nitrospira) were used to determine, in conjunction with AOB data, reactor operating factors which may lead to NOB removal. From literature, the AOBs have been hypothesised to have a higher oxygen affinity (lower oxygen half saturation constant, K[subscript]o) than NOBs. The K[subscript]o values of both Nitrospira and Nitrobacter enrichments (NOBs) and a Nitrosomonas enrichment (AOB) were determined with floc size distributions that indicated oxygen mass transfer was negligible as 0.54 &#177; 0.14 mg.L&#175;&#185;, 0.43 &#177; 0.08 mg.L&#175;&#185; and 0.033 &#177; 0.003mg.L&#175;&#185;, respectively.

The growth rate values of the same Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter enrichments were determined using a novel nitrifier growth rate method (developed in this thesis) as 0.47 &#177; 0.09 day&#175;&#185; and 0.60 &#177; 0.03 day&#175;&#185;, respectively. Therefore, whilst the NOB maximum growth rate was determined as greater than that of the AOB maximum growth rate at saturated dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, at low DO concentration the maximum growth rate of AOBs was determined as greater than the maximum growth rate of the NOBs. Hence, washout of NOBs was achieved by operating a continuous reactor at a DO concentration (0.4 mg.L&#175;&#185;) and a sludge retention time of 2.4 days which allowed for AOB retention but not NOBs. The results from the continuous reactor experiments suggested that the growth rate of NOBs may not be exclusively greater than the AOB growth rate, contrary to previous thought. Therefore, if aeration is terminated at the end of ammonium oxidation in a batch process (such as a sequencing batch reactor; SBR) with accumulated nitrite remaining, then the relative population of AOBs would eventually dominate. Indeed this concept was investigated using an SBR treating domestic wastewater (TKN concentration of about 43 mgN.L&#175;&#185;) with a pre-denitrification configuration and only the termination of aeration at the end of ammonium oxidation (aerobic duration control) as the selection factor for AOBs. The process proved effective in achieving a steady state whereby 80% nitrification to nitrite (20% to nitrate) was observed. Investigation of the cause of nitrification to nitrite by a calibrated ammonium and nitrite oxidation model showed the aerobic duration control as the key selection factor for AOBs. The results of numerous simulations with the same computer model also verified the importance of a greater AOB growth rate than a NOB growth rate in achieving sustained nitrite as the product of nitrification. The processes developed in this thesis to remove NOBs, i.e. low DO concentration and aerobic duration control could theoretically be implemented in current operational wastewater treatment plants. The low DO concentration selection factor against NOBs would probably be more effective in combination with other selection factors against NOBs (e.g. high temperature) as this would enhance the effectiveness of such processes. However, the aerobic duration control could theoretically be implemented immediately in similar SBR processes treating similar domestic wastewater.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158272</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into electricity pool price trends and forecasting for understanding the operation of the Australian national electricity market (NEM)</field><field name="creator">Sansom, Damien</field><field name="description">This thesis reports findings from a number of modern machine learning techniques applied to electricity market price forecasting. The techniques evaluated were Support Vector Machines, Boosting, Bayesian networks, neural networks and a weekly average method. All techniques were evaluated on seven day into the future forecasting of the Regional Reference (pool) Prices (RRP) for the New South Wales (NSW) region of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Due to highly volatile and non-repetitive nature of the NSW RRP, all complex machine learning methods provided inferior accuracy forecasts compared to a weekly average method. The weekly average method was computationally less expensive and more transparent to the user than any of the machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen for its novel application to electricity price forecasting because it is considered to be the next generation to neural networks. The structured SVM training algorithm proved more consistent and reliable than the neural network algorithm. Bayesian networks offer the adaptability of a neural network with the advantage of providing a price forecast with confidence intervals for each half-hour determined from the actual data. The SVM and Bayesian techniques were found to provide acceptable forecasts for NSW demand. An investigation of international electricity markets found that each market was unique with different market structures, regulations, network topologies and ownership regimes. Price forecasting techniques and results cannot be universally applied without careful consideration of local conditions. For instance, price data for the Spanish and Californian electricity markets were investigated and found to have significantly lower price volatility than the NSW region of the NEM. An extensive examination of the NSW RRP showed that the price exhibited no consistent long-term trend. A stationary data set could not be extracted from the price data. Thus, making forecasting unsuited to techniques using large historical data sets. The strongest pattern found for NSW prices was the weekly cycle, so a weekly average method was developed to utilise this weekly cycle. Over 25 weeks of NSW RRP from February to July 2002, the seven day into the future price forecast mean absolute error (MAE) for the SVM technique was 27.8%. The weekly average method was more accurate with an MAE of 20.6% and with a simple linear price adjustment for demand, the error was reduced to 18.1%. The price spikes and uneven distribution of prices were unsuitable for the Boosting or Bayesian network techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">660301 Electricity transmission</field><field name="subject">660304 Energy systems analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158223</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power loss allocation methods for deregulated electricity markets</field><field name="creator">Lim, Valerie Shia Chin</field><field name="description">The deregulation of the electricity industry has introduced many opportunities as well as challenges to the once monopolised industry. This recent reform towards a competitive electricity industry advocates a need for charging energy losses to market participants through a more satisfactory and transparent mechanism. Market participants, whether they are generators or consumers, would want a loss allocation scheme that is able to reflect each market participants' contribution of generation or usage in the network. However, as electricity is an indistinguishable entity, there is no accurate method to trace the flow of electricity thus far. Hence, the issue of power loss allocation within the deregulated market still remains an unresolved setback to progress to a fully competitive electricity market. Many loss allocation methods have been introduced, however, none have been universally accepted. This thesis investigates existing power flow tracing and loss allocation methods in order to critically analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each method. They include loss allocation methods currently employed in Australia&#146;s National Electricity Market (NEM) and Great Britain Market, as well as a selection of better known loss allocation methods that are introduced in the academic research field. Understanding of these methods makes it easier to choose a method that is more suitable for each electricity market. Many researchers believe that a resolution is through a fair and equitable allocation of losses. However, the definition of &#147;fair and equitable&#148; varies from one literature to another. In general, a fair and equitable loss allocation method should meet electrical laws as well as economical laws. This is because market driven transactions have become the new independent decision variables that define the behaviour of electric power systems. This definition is then used as the basis to assess the results obtained from the implementation of each existing method analysed. It was found that a key limitation of existing methods is the lack of a method that is able to trace the usage allocation of each generator to each load in an electrically justifiable manner. Any improvement to existing loss allocation methods should address this limitation. Thus, the main objective of this thesis is to present two transaction based methods that have been developed and tested by the author of this thesis. Fundamentally, both methods hold the capability to analyse losses involved in the transfer of power from one point of the network to another point. The first investigated method is based on the network reduction method, where a system is reduced to the nodes of interest. The second method is based on the loop frame of reference. Instead of representing the network flows through the commonly accepted nodal frame of reference, power flows within the network are instead expressed as the sum of power flows around loops that links loads to active sources. This provides the loop-based method with an advantage in which it allows the power requirements of a load to be viewed as emanating from an active source and also the advantage of assessing the viability of contract agreements within a hybrid market model. The final objective of this thesis is to analytically compare selected existing loss allocation schemes with the proposed loop-based method. As there are no standard means of judging the accuracy of any loss allocation methods, the author of this thesis proposed a different way to distinguish different loss allocation methods. That is, through the type of competition that each method promotes. A wide range of results is obtained in which the loss allocations of some methods are dependent only on the real power injection at each bus. On the other hand, the loss allocations of other methods such as the loop-based method are dependent on network operation efficiency. The comprehension of the different type of competitions each method promotes aims to assist market regulators in recognising the feasibility of employing each loss allocation method.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290901 Electrical Engineering</field><field name="subject">660301 Electricity transmission</field><field name="subject">660304 Energy systems analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Longwall shearer cutting force estimation</field><field name="creator">Reid, Anthony Walton</field><field name="description">A methodology to monitor the real-time cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer is developed. Longwall shearers are the single productive element in an underground longwall coal mine, and are a major source of unscheduled system downtime. The cutting forces constitute the interaction between the longwall and the coal face. Knowledge of the forces can improve the reliability and productivity of longwall mines by providing a means of shearer condition monitoring. A Kalman filter based cutting force estimator is developed, and then tested using a comprehensive shearer simulation incorporating a dynamic representation of the cutterhead. Subsequently, prior work on autonomous shearer guidance with measured pick forces is extended by employing the estimated cutting forces to track changes to the shearer's horizon. This is validated by simulation. The force estimation methodology uses an extended Kalman filter to blend noisy measurement information with a nonlinear system model, the latter combining the dynamics of the shearer and its inputs. A detailed model is developed of the shearer rigid body dynamics, and of the measurements required for observability. The formulation avoids the use of sensors at the coal cutting interface. The methodology uses proven, practicable and reliable sensor technologies, making it suitable for longterm force monitoring. A comprehensive simulation of a longwall shearer is developed using the MATLAB(R) Simulink(R) and MSC.visualNastran 4DTM software environments. This incorporates dynamic representations of the major structures and inputs, including the interaction between the cutterhead and the coal face. The simulation is used to investigate the cutting forces in a number of different operational scenarios. This facilitates the construction of a basic dynamic model of the forces, and provides insight into the relationship between the cutting forces and the condition of the cutting interface. The cutting force estimator is tested using measurements from the shearer simulations. It is shown that the cutting force estimates track the fiducial forces well in each scenario. A number of modifications to the force models are also shown to improve the performance of the estimator. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the effect of tuned process noise covariance and model parameter errors on the estimates. The application to the problems of shearer condition monitoring and horizon tracking are considered. The first is demonstrated by detecting the effects of a worn pick and a seam hardness gradient on the force estimates, and the second by using the force estimates to track the motion of the cutterhead relative to an embedded stone band. The results show that it is possible, in principle, to estimate the cutting forces generated by a longwall shearer from indirect measurements using a Kalman filter methodology. Furthermore, the force estimates reveal changes to the cutting environment, and can track the vertical motion of the shearer as it operates. This thesis represents the first step in the development of a shearer cutting force estimator. The ultimate goal of the research is to improve the reliability and productivity of Australian longwall operations, using the estimated forces to monitor shearer condition. Autonomous horizon tracking with estimated forces can lead to further improvements to longwall productivity, and to the health and safety of mine personnel. A number of recommendations are made for future field validation, and development of an automated shearer condition monitoring system based on the cutting force estimates.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290502 Industrial Engineering</field><field name="subject">650202 Coal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158453</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance evaluation of advanced traffic control systems in a developing country</field><field name="creator">Sutandi, A Caroline</field><field name="description">Traffic congestion is increasingly becoming a severe problem in many large cities around the world. The problem is more complex in developing countries where cities are growing at a much faster rate than those in the developed world. Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) are one of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) technologies that have been recommended and used as a tool to ease congestion problems in many large cities in the developing world. However, it is unknown how specific local conditions commonly observed in these cities, such as poor lane discipline and complex road user interactions, affect the performance of these systems. GETRAM (Generic Environment for Traffic Analysis and Modeling) was used in this research as a tool to develop microscopic traffic simulation models for the city of Bandung in Indonesia. The field data in this research, comprising throughputs, queue lengths and travel times, were collected during peak and off peak periods from all 90 signalised intersections connected to SCATS (Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System). This field data is believed to comprise one of the largest sets of &#147;real world&#148; data available for the development and validation of microscopic traffic simulation models. Two data sets were collected for this research: the first was used to develop and calibrate the simulation model and the second was used for validation. A number of statistical tests were used to determine the adequacy of the model in replicating traffic conditions. The results of statistical tests clearly showed that all of the calibrated and validated models reproduced field conditions with an acceptable degree of confidence. Therefore, the models were accepted as accurate and valid replications of the &#147;real world&#148;. The validated models were then used to evaluate the performance of SCATS which was implemented in Bandung in June 1997 as a pilot project. The results of comparative evaluation of the models under SCATS and under the Fixed Time control (without SCATS) demonstrated that SCATS did not necessarily always produce better results than the Fixed Time control. Furthermore, the performance of SCATS was strongly influenced by specific local conditions in the city. The multiple regression method was used to investigate the relationship between the traffic performance measures and significant basic variables. Based on this analysis, the main findings were: first, throughput was found to increase at intersections with higher v/c (volume to capacity) ratios. Second, throughput was found to decrease at intersections with higher numbers of phases and movements, longer widths of leg intersections, and farther distances to adjacent intersections. Third, queue length was found to increase at intersections with higher numbers of phases and movements. Based on the above findings, a number of improvements were recommended to enhance the performance of SCATS. This research also used traffic simulation to evaluate the impacts of these recommended improvements in increasing the performance of SCATS. The main findings from this evaluation were: first, restricted number of phases and movements at selected intersections substantially increased the traffic flow (78%) and decreased the queue length (by 55 to 67%) at the intersection. Second, making leg intersections wider&#151;without physically building additional road capacity but by changing the stream with higher road hierarchy and higher v/c ratio from a two-way road into a one-way road&#151;has a great impact on enhancing the performance of SCATS. Traffic flows were found to increase between 7 and 106%, and queue lengths were found to markedly decrease between 77 and 100% at all the suggested intersections. Third, the application of SCATS at intersections which are not closely spaced was not effective. Therefore, it is recommended that intersections which are not closely spaced remain under the Fixed Time control. The results and findings from this study provide road authorities in developing countries with an appreciation and enhanced understanding of the factors that influence the performance of traffic management systems in cities with similar characteristics to those in Bandung. These findings will also assist traffic engineers determine the best practices for the implementation of advanced traffic control systems in their cities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290803 Transport Engineering</field><field name="subject">690101 Road safety</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158169</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of affect, fairness, and social identification in vertical and lateral exchange relationships</field><field name="creator">Tse, Ho-Man Herman</field><field name="description">Considerable research attention has been devoted to understanding the implications of leader-member exchange (LMX) theory over the last thirty years (see Graen &amp; Uhl-Bien, 1995, for a review). A review of research has suggested that LMX substantially influences employees' work attitudes and behaviours (e.g., see Gerstner &amp; Day, 1997; Janssen &amp; Van Yperen, 2004). Nonetheless, there is an important omission in LMX research; namely, how does LMX quality influence people outside of the dyadic relationships (Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995)? Sparrowe and Liden (1997), Liden and Sparrowe (in press) and Oh, Chung and Labianca (2004) suggest that interpersonal exchange relationships between leaders, subordinates, and coworkers are interconnected to constitute a larger social system that operates in teams and organisations. Similarly, based on a systems perspective, Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) call for more research to understand how LMX dyadic relationships influence employees' work attitudes, behaviours and perceptions in larger collectives of workgroups. This is because LMX quality is not only influenced by, but may also influence other exchange relationships within the larger system. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the characteristics of a dyadic relationship between a leader and a subordinate will also have implications for team member exchange (TMX), defined by Seers (1989) as the relationship quality between an individual and her or his team members (see also Sherony &amp; Green, 2002; Sias, 1996; Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995). In this thesis, therefore, my aim is to advance the research on interpersonal exchange relationships by addressing research questions that explore how vertical exchange relationships between supervisors and subordinates influence lateral exchange relationships among team members in organisations. Specifically, I have integrated social exchange theory (SET), social identity theory (SIT), emotional contagion theory (ECT), and climate research to develop and to test a multilevel model. At the individual level, I theorised that LMX quality influences individual team members' perceptions of TMX quality. I also hypothesised that social identification and affect act as cognitive and affective mechanisms that mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality. At the group level, I hypothesised that LMX differentiation fairness moderates the relationship between LMX quality and social identification, while affective climate moderates the relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality. In order to test the validity of my model, I adopted the post-positivist research position resting on a realist ontology (what is the nature of reality), an objective epistemology (the relationship between the knowledge and the inquirer), where both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate the hypothesised relationships in three studies. Study 1 was an exploratory study intended to identify the nature of TMX and the role of emotions within the team member exchange relationships. Personal in-depth interviews and surveys were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data in this study. The sample for this study was 25 employees working in five different teams in a private health service provider and a medium-sized construction material company in Australia. The qualitative results revealed that a variety of exchanges occur within the team member relationships, including relationship-oriented and task-oriented exchanges. Team members also reported that they experienced both positive and negative emotions in response to their TMX relationships. The quantitative results further indicated that positive emotions, rather than negative emotions, were associated with effective TMX relationships. These results support the findings of past research on TMX and emotions in teams, suggesting TMX relationship was an important outcome variable. Based on these results, only positive affect was included in the model to be examined in the remainder of the studies. Study 2 used a quantitative cross-sectional design to examine the relationships between LMX quality, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality at the individual level of the multilevel model. The sample for this study was 262 employees of an Australian bank and a national restaurant chain. A web-survey was developed and used to collect data from employees and structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the data. Results showed that LMX quality was positively related to social identification and TMX quality. Further, social identification was found to mediate the relationship between LMX quality and TMX quality, while positive affect mediated the relationship between social identification and TMX quality. These results are consistent with SET, SIT and ECT and support the individual-level relationships between the variables in the model. Study 3 was designed to test the group-level moderating effects of LMX differentiation fairness and affective climate on individual-level relationships between the variables. This study built on the results of Study 2 to evaluate the validity of the overall model. Manager-reported and self-reported questionnaires were used to collected data from 2 15 manager-employee matched dyads working in 36 teams for an Australian bank. Managers provided ratings on LMX quality for each of their subordinates within a team, while employees provided ratings on LMX differentiation fairness, affective climate, social identification, positive affect, and TMX quality. Hierarchical liner modelling (HLM) was used to analyse the multilevel data. Results confirmed that the individual-level relationship between individual team members' positive affect and TMX quality was moderated by group-level affective climate. Overall, findings from this research provide mostly supportive evidence for the hypothesised relationships in the model. The major findings demonstrate that employees enjoying high-quality LMX relationships tend to develop high-quality TMX relationships with their team members because they strongly identify with their teams, and that this identification induces positive emotions, which in turn enhances TMX quality. In addition, individual team members experiencing positive affect were found to be more likely to form high-quality TMX relationships with others when the affective climate in their teams is strong. To the best of my knowledge, this research is among the first to explore interpersonal exchange relationships in a larger social system in organisations by developing and testing a multilevel model. I have outlined the theoretical contributions of this research to SET, SIT, ECT, and climate research. In practical terms, this research increases our understanding of how managers use high-quality relationships with subordinates as a means of maximising individual and team effectiveness by demonstrating concern for subordinates' emotional well-being in the workplace.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720403 Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158266</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value relevance of superannuation disclosures for Australian companies 2002 and 2003</field><field name="creator">Crossman, Deborah Mary</field><field name="description">The focus of interest in this research is the value relevance of superannuation disclosures for corporate employers sponsoring Defined Benefit Plans on behalf of employees. For the period of this study, the two years 2002 and 2003, the relevant reporting requirements came within the accounting standard for employee benefits, AASB 1028. Prior Australian research on superannuation disclosures has already established that such disclosures were value relevant, at least based on an industrial sample in 1995, and more recently on a full sample for the period 2000 to 2003. The primary purpose of this study is to examine the hypothesis that this relationship between shareholder value and superannuation disclosures is asymmetrical i.e. significantly different depending on whether the company-sponsored fund represents a liability (deficit) or an asset (surplus) of the sponsor firm. The reason for investigating this conjecture was that, in light of the changed conditions in the Australian market for many firms, the net asset position of a number of superannuation plans deteriorated, providing the evidence to investigate this hypothesis for the first time. The research methodology used in this study investigates value relevance using the balance sheet valuation model developed by Landsman (1986) and since used in several studies. The findings of the study provide new evidence in support of this hypothesis, consistent with the view that the market will devalue the firm heavily when the fund is in deficit, but will appreciate the value of the firm significantly less heavily when the fund is in surplus. The study finds support for the observed market behaviour in prior research relevant to the impact of &#145;bad news&#146; and the consequent market reaction. The findings are particularly relevant at a time of change in the accounting regulations for superannuation disclosures for corporate sponsors with the move to adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards from January 2005.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350101 Financial Accounting</field><field name="subject">710401 Finance and investment services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158239</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effective information technology governance arrangements</field><field name="creator">Cheung, May-Yin Decca</field><field name="description">For many organisations Information Technology (IT) enabled business initiatives and IT infrastructure constitute major investments. If these investments are not managed properly or the technological initiatives are not integrated correctly within the business, the organisation&#146;s competitive position is impaired. Currently, both management and IT professionals are concerned with design, implementation, and assessment of IT governance strategies to ensure that technology truly serves the needs of the business. These strategies aim to align IT applications with the objectives of the business. The question addressed by this research is: How does a complex organisation devise, implement, and assess its IT governance arrangements? Devising IT governance arrangements is challenging because the success of IT strategies and procedures is contingent upon a variety of internal and external factors, such as workgroup interdependency and competitive strategy. Implementing an IT governance framework can be a complex endeavour because organisations must integrate the unique expertise of diverse stakeholders and service providers. This research explores the factors influencing the IT governance structures, processes, and outcome metrics. Using data from an in-depth case study conducted in a complex energy organisation, this research provides empirical evidence that increases our understanding of IT governance arrangements. Interview responses indicated that effective IT governance performance outcomes are characterised by a shared understanding of business and IT objectives; active involvement of IT steering committees; a balance of business and IT representatives in IT decision making; and comprehensive and wellcommunicated IT strategies and policies. IT governance plays a key role in fostering project success and delivering value. Effective IT project governance outcomes are characterised by the existence of executive leaders as project champions of IT, the use of appropriate measurement techniques during a priori and interim evaluations of IT projects, and extensive post implementation evaluation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280102 Information Systems Management</field><field name="subject">700200 Other Information Services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158160</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading conservatoria through change. New challenges for music institutions and their leaders, 1985-2005</field><field name="creator">Lancaster, Helen May</field><field name="description">Conservatoria in the past provided prospective musicians with training in performance, generally in the classical Western European tradition. Most of them were independent of universities, free from academic constraints, focused on performance, flexible in their practice, and desirous of (yet susceptible to) high profile individual leadership. The last two decades in particular have generated significant change, placing conservatoria under increasing pressure from new challenges. Now confronting those shifting boundaries which have reshaped the artistic climate and organisational environment, many are also compelled to broaden access whilst meeting the challenge of reduced government subsidy. New higher education policies and declining resources have caused the relocation of many conservatoria into the university sector, most particularly (but not exclusively) in Australia and the USA. This development has resulted in new systems of governance and different expectations of both the conservatorium and its leaders. Thus government policy impacts on the potential shape of the conservatorium. Changing funding structures in higher education and the arts further complicate the influence government policy might have on conservatoria. For autonomous conservatoria, government arts and education policies directly effect institutional policy and financial stability. Where conservatoria exist within universities, a domino effect devolves the impact of higher education policy to internal units like the conservatorium. Compounding these circumstances is the reality that traditional performance is diminishing in social relevance and the professions into which future music graduates will move are now more diverse than ever before and clearly less dependent solely on conventional music training. Consequently contemporary conservatorium leaders now confront a different, less compliant musical environment. Decisions made by these leaders have the potential to impact well beyond conservatorium walls. Therefore, for those conservatoria which have evolved as part of the cultural infrastructure of their respective communities, internal conservatorium choices may obscure the broader ramifications these choices have for the wider community. From inside the university sector, some conservatoria are challenged to give priority to the needs of the university community, with resultant effects on their individual conservatorium characters. The time-honoured preference for conservatorium leaders to be renowned musicians does not necessarily meet all of the contemporary criteria relevant to the role. Traditionally, leaders in conservatoria were selected for their artistic profile, ostensibly to enhance that of the institution. As spokespersons and figureheads of their institutions, leaders once made more artistic considerations and connections than strategic decisions. Whereas in years past they may have maintained high profile roles as conductors, performers, composers, or musicologists, now leaders are expected to provide varying degrees of artistic direction, academic leadership, curriculum design, administration, financial management, facilities management, event production, marketing, public relations, and community liaison. These diverse roles make an external career unrealistic for most. This dissertation examines the challenges confronting conservatoria as they appear through the eyes of conservatorium leaders around the world. By analysing the leaders&#146; comments in parallel with surveys, case examples, and documentary research, I aim to develop an understanding of the impact these challenges have on conservatoria and those who lead them. Through continual reporting of the emerging results back to the field during the period of the research, I build on their credibility, shedding light on those policies which both shape the conservatorium condition and elicit resilience among some who lead them. The thesis argues that each conservatorium is distinctive, and that the challenges confronting a conservatorium must be viewed in the light of its specific, often unique context. Among conservatoria, uniqueness emerges from the common ground that all such institutions share: within the context of conservatorium family resemblances, it may be that one conservatorium has a mix of quite distinctive attributes or conditions. It is that idiosyncratic set of circumstances shaping each institutional environment which generates this uniqueness, making generalisations problematical and inappropriate to the conservatorium condition. Each context is further complicated by constant change which is both evolutionary and imposed. For these reasons, there is no single profile fitting a conservatorium leader. Rather, leadership style needs to align to shifting circumstances, which implies that conservatorium leaders need to understand how to adjust their approach to leadership as the individual setting evolves. The argument is consistent with the findings that purposive preparation is crucial for leaders of contemporary conservatoria, to give them the diversity of skills required for the role and the flexibility necessary to adapt to changing circumstances. Because a conservatorium has the potential to be part of the cultural infrastructure of the community in which it resides, these conditions carry implications which extend beyond the conservatorium and have the capacity to impact on future generations. The conservatorium culture implies natural intersections with the community through the provision of performance and teaching services. Conservatorium facilities in their turn become part of the repertoire of community performance and recording resources. The extent to which this relationship might develop relies on each conservatorium&#146;s perception of its place within its own community, and each leader&#146;s interpretation of this positioning.

The popularity of these books, combined with some of his own statements and his unconventional and adventurous life, have given him a reputation as a whimsical and lightweight writer who stood aside from mainstream Victorian life. Recent criticism, especially of Jekyll and Hyde, has done much to redress this, and to show Stevenson as an essentially Victorian figure. It has not, however, shown the extent to which Stevenson internalised ideas of deviation from the normal and envisioned himself as constrained by a degenerative ethos. Stevenson's fiction came to be formed in a matrix of deep anxiety caused by chronic illness, social and familial pressure, censorship, and onerous financial burdens. The thesis assesses Stevenson's fictional works in light of his belief that he was deformed, both as an artist and as an individual, by what he saw as the degenerative power of the age in which he lived. Drawing heavily on Stevenson's correspondence, and that of his personal and literary circle, this work contends that the associated motifs of deformity, disguise and degeneration are widespread in Stevenson's fiction, and that they frequently refute the prevailing cultural attitudes of his time. The thesis explores representations of deformity in a variety of forms, including physical, social and artistic depictions. It shows that Stevenson, one of the most experimental and broad-ranging writers of his era, was forced by the dictates of an age increasingly obsessed with control and delineation to produce fiction that conformed to rigid codes of genre and style. It demonstrates that when Stevenson violated these codes - as he did with heightening determination - he was forced either to temper or to abandon the works he had created. Finally, the thesis assesses Stevenson's Pacific fiction in relation to his failed escape from - as he saw it - the oppressive and corrosive effects of the Old World, and it considers how, ultimately, notions of deformity overwhelmed the writer entirely.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420201 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158219</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy. The final poem, a sequence of versions of lesser known works of Rilke, attempts to negotiate the portal separating such extremes through grace. My critical essay &#8211; A Psychoanalytic Discourse on Creation, Destruction, Perversion, Reparation and Creation in the Works of John Scott &#8211; addresses the problems of such creation by means of a psychoanalytic literary discourse.

The critical essay is an investigation into the nature of narrative suspense, its operation, and the techniques by which an author can develop it. Narrative suspense requires that readers care for characters and feel uncertain about events. An author can use a number of story-telling techniques to make the most of this emotion and uncertainty. Readers may embark on a variety of activities including imagining outcomes and piecing together clues, and these too can be utilised by the author to build suspense. Following the examination of the subject, I explore the development of the drafts of Frantic with particular emphasis on how my research into suspense changed my approach to characterisation, structure, and the process of writing. The creative project is the manuscript Frantic, a crime thriller set in present-day Sydney. When Paramedic Sophie Phillips&#146; husband Chris is shot and their baby kidnapped, Detective Ella Marconi struggles to solve the case. Evidence suggests the act may be revenge by a bereaved father for Sophie&#146;s failure to save a mother and her newborn, and equally that senior constable Chris may have been involved in the police corruption that increasingly appears rife. Distraught Sophie knows what she believes, and when the police fail to find her son she takes matters into her own hands.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400103 Professional Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158213</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design guidelines for indoor comfort in row houses in hot-humid climates.</field><field name="creator">Takkanon, Pattaranan</field><field name="description">Many countries in hot-humid regions cope with rapid urbanisation. Land cost becomes higher especially in high-density areas. There is a demand of residential and commercial buildings due to the economic growth in the cities. Row house became a popular building type since it combines both functions in one place. A large amount of row houses are found in Bangkok, Thailand. Despite their versatility, they are not properly designed for the climate and urban conditions. The occupants adopt air conditioning systems to control indoor comfort whereas row houses are not properly designed for the installation of the airconditioners. This increases the energy demand. This research aims to establish appropriate design guidelines and recommendations to ensure indoor comfort in urban row houses in hot-humid climates. Thermal comfort is the main concern apart from others such as visual, acoustic and indoor air quality. Thermal stress should be minimised by primarily passive means as long as possible and the building design should also provide the flexibility for operating active systems whenever they are required. To achieve this aim, it is important to assess indoor conditions in existing row houses to provide a basis of comparison. A case study in Bangkok has been selected for a field investigation during the hottest month of the year to examine how the case study responds to the critical condition. Flow visualisation tests have been conducted to compare the results of indoor air velocity to those of the field investigation. Computer simulations have been carried out to investigate and compare the performance of design variables affecting indoor comfort such as orientation, zone location, roof and wall materials, aperture schedules, and shading devices. Two blocks of 4-level row houses have been simulated and three units: an intermediate and two units at the both ends of the row have been examined. There are two sets of the simulations: naturally ventilated and air-conditioned cases. Then, the design guidelines and recommendations are developed based on the results from the two series of simulations. Results from the 3-day field investigation show that indoor conditions of the case study are overheated. The indoor temperatures are slightly lower than To during the day while they are higher than To during the night. These results correspond to those of simulation runs for a verification study. The wind tunnel test shows low indoor air velocities. It is recommended to install ceiling fans to increase the wind speed enough to generate cooling effect. The level of interior illuminance drops with distance from the window. It should be improved by installing artificial light sources in the area far from the opening. The sound levels exceed the noise control limit at all times. Results from the simulations for the naturally ventilated and air-conditioned row houses show some similarities. In the former, internal conditions of the occupied units are above the comfort limit almost all day. Orientation is a crucial factor affecting the indoor thermal condition. The front of a row house should face either north or south and the end unit with east-facing side wall performs better than that with west-facing side wall. The worst orientation is generally west but the east could be worse for the end unit with south-facing side wall at such an orientation. The effect of zone location is also related to the orientation. The intermediate unit is more sensitive to design variables since it generally shows the biggest T difference between the variants with the best and the worst design factors. Aperture schedule has a great effect on indoor conditions for naturally ventilated cases. Closing windows during the day could keep the zone cooler than opening the windows which would admit the hot air from the outside. Concrete flat roof with ceiling insulation gives the best results while metal sheet roof gives the worst. Concrete block with acoustic board performs best for both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings while the worst wall type is aerated concrete in cases of the naturally ventilated buildings and common brick wall in cases of the air-conditioned ones. However, the results from the effect of roof and wall material study show that adding insulation could improve the indoor condition more effectively than changing the roof and wall materials. An additional height from the mezzanine floor only affects the thermal performance of the room on ground floor. In comparison to the row house without mezzanine floor, the presence of mezzanine slightly increases indoor temperature in naturally ventilated cases while increases cooling load of the room on the ground floor drastically in air-conditioned cases. Shading devices should be designed particularly for each orientation since their effects are tremendous once applied to the opening to protect it from solar radiation. The limited distance between the front of row houses and the street as allowed in the existing building regulations should be extended for the devices to provide enough shading for the building.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310201 Building Science and Techniques</field><field name="subject">680200 Design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158307</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chinese EFL Learners' Pragmatic Competence in Requests</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xian</field><field name="description">This study examines the development of pragmatic competence in requests in two groups of Chinese EFL learners (advanced and intermediate) in a tertiary institute in Macau, China. The learners answer a written discourse completion test that contains ten scenarios where they request common services or ask for favours. The request behaviours are examined in terms of utterance length, strategy types, formulaic expressions, and modifications (internal and external). It is found that, compared with a group of native speakers of English, the learners have not developed native-like pragmatic behaviours. Although the advanced and the intermediate learner groups reach native-like distribution in STRATEGY TYPE for the scenarios taken together, statistically significant differences from the native group are observed in several individual scenarios (particularly with the intermediate learners). In addition, the two groups of learners employ formulaic expressions sharply differently from the native group in types and according to scenario. The learners do not use internal modifiers as frequently or situation-differentially as the native group: they do not show a strong preference for bi-clausal structures and conditionals in the scenarios of substantial favour asking. The learners employ elaborated external modifications and are verbose in requests. According to Bialystok&#146;s (1993, 1994) two-dimensional model of pragmatic competence, the learners are missing analytical knowledge of the scenario-specific behaviours, and their control ability is not fully developed. This study examines adult Chinese learners of English in a foreign language environment, and extends our knowledge of the development of request behaviours in children in second language environments (Achiba, 2003; Ellis, 1992). It also relates to the research on formulae in SLA (Wray, 2000, 2002; Kecskes, 2002) by providing empirical data on formulaic expressions in learners&#146; requests. It is further argued that further examination of interlanguage pragmatics should be (a) scenario-based, and (b) formulae-based.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158270</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating re-purchase intention in an experiential context using operations and marketing perspectives</field><field name="creator">Hume, Margee</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to undertake theory development and testing particular to re-purchase intention in an experiential service context, specifically the cultural performing arts. Services researchers suggest implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to research that uses theories and methods from several of the management fields will advance the domain of services research. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of service research by drawing from methods and theories offered in both service operations and services marketing fields. To date, service research has been preoccupied primarily with consumer behaviour aspects of services marketing such as satisfaction but underestimates the importance of constructs such as re-purchase intention and the subsequent implications for strategy formulation and implementation. Further to this, the current approach to services research has overlooked the nexus between marketing and operations and the importance of the implementation of strategy to achieve objectives. It is argued that failing to integrate service operations both practically and theoretically into the re-purchase intentions research framework confines its potential effectiveness. In addition, the lack of specific service context application has been identified as a significant oversight in previous services research. Construct measurements and findings have been difficult to replicate across contexts and contextual examination of constructs and relationships has been suggested as a solution. One such context deserving of attention is that of the experiential services, specifically the performing arts. Therefore, using measures and theories developed specifically for this context, this thesis will offer a more comprehensive approach to re-purchase intention research in a performing arts setting. This thesis adopts a mixed method approach by implementing a series of three integrated studies, which amalgamates both operations and marketing fields. This thesis aims to identify the aspects of a performing arts encounter that are relevant to the customer by conducting a two-staged set of qualitative interviews. This process is based on the operations technique Service Transaction Analysis (STA). First, consultant consumers and organisational personnel were used to formulate a consensus definition of a typical performing arts experience and, second, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with potential future consumers of the performing arts based on this description of the offering. These two studies, coupled with extant literature, informed the research instrument designed for the main survey. This instrument was conducted on 273 potential future consumers of the performing arts. Qualitative work undertaken in Study 1 identifies the service experience description. Study 2 highlights the service management and marketing issues relating to re-purchase intention especially focusing on value, customer satisfaction, show experience and service quality and discloses a set of specific issues incorporated into the wording of the survey instrument. Study 3 measures and tests the key constructs of service quality, show experience, value, satisfaction and the significance of the hypothesised pathways to re-purchase intention. The proposed model is then analysed using the AMOS 5.0 Structural Equation Modelling package. This thesis is structured in the journal paper format with each of the chapters representing each of the five journal papers. In addition, an introductory and concluding chapter are appended with the concluding chapter providing an in-depth discussion of the contributions of this thesis. The papers are based on the progressive results of the research program and offer an integrated set of findings and discussions. The papers are not mutually exclusive but interrelated to comprehensively illuminate the central research theme of the thesis and discuss many aspects of marketing and operations significant to re-purchase intention. The entire thesis is drawn from the data set generated from the three integrated studies developed to address the overall research theme. The central research theme is to investigate the nature of re-purchase intention in an experiential setting using marketing and operations theories as platforms of analysis. Interestingly, the tested model of this thesis found empirically that the subjective and experiential aspects of the service, such as the emotional and artistic quality of the show, did not have a significant and direct relationship with re-purchase intention. This finding is of interest, in particular, to scholars of experiential consumption and marketing practitioners offering these types of services. Previous research has supported the desire to fulfil experiential needs as driving the initial purchase. Conversely, this finding suggests that the desire to visit again is driven by utility and value. As customer maintenance and repeat patronage are of utmost importance to practice, this is an exciting development. Offering further support, the tested model found service quality and show experience were mediated by value to satisfaction, with satisfaction inturn mediating the relationship between value and re-purchase intention. Collectively, these findings have lead to several developments and contributions for both scholarship and practice. The contributions to knowledge of this thesis highlight five main theoretical contributions and four main managerial implications. These encompass: &#183; Advancing the &#145;service management trinity&#146;, specifically strengthening the importance of the relationship between service marketing and service operations. &#183; Advancing service management theory by understanding the service offering more intricately and the importance of service description. &#183; Clarifying the roles of experiential and utilitarian attributes of the service experience in an experiential setting extending knowledge related to re-purchase intention. &#183; Particularizing and measuring the construct of re-purchase intention to the performing arts and clarifying the predictors of this construct in the context of experiential performing arts. . &#183; Testing and clarifying the relationships of value and satisfaction to re-purchase intention extending the understanding of re-purchase intention in this field and elaborating the approach and understanding of this construct for future research. This thesis further contributes to knowledge by offering several managerial contributions. These incorporate: &#183; Market segmentation and targeting strategies as critical for performing arts management. &#183; Operations service design and creation strategies in the performing arts by including important aspects of the service experience as highlighted by customer driven research. &#183; Specific recommendation for streamlining delivery through standardised mass customisation. &#183; Offering value frameworks for creating value in service delivery and targeting customer perceptions of superior value. This extending the understanding of the customer perceived value equation. By contributing to the field of service management and advancing enquiry in the field of services marketing and service operations, this thesis offers a new perspective and practical approach to service marketing context analysis making a valuable contribution to scholarship. This approach is based on improving organisational performance in experiential services specifically by applying operations and marketing theory from a customer-perspective. By doing this, findings inform organisations of ways to better meet the needs and wants of consumers through design, delivery and marketing. Moreover, the findings assist researchers in further advancing the field of services research. This research positions the future research program to focus on continuing the advancement of service management by examining the higher order constructs of service quality and show experience and examining the impact of additional customer motivations such as emotional goal attainment and involvement in experiential settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">services marketing</field><field name="subject">services operations</field><field name="subject">performing arts</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158043</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategic management framework for reformed electricity generation firms in Eastern Australia.</field><field name="creator">Skoufa, Lucas A.</field><field name="description">Strategy formulation for electricity generation firms in Eastern Australia in the environment of restructuring is the focus of this thesis. The ideological basis of electricity industry restructuring around the world has been based on neo-classical economics and the specific notion that firms in competitive markets are more efficient than vertically integrated government-owned monopolies. From a strategic management perspective it is assumed that firms will attempt to create a competitive advantage and accrue above normal profits, which contrasts with the requirement of the electricity regulatory regime view that no firm will make above normal profits or exercise market power. A review of literature on the economics of electricity markets is covered in Chapter 2, and Chapter 3 discusses the key aspects of strategic management including the concepts of competitive advantage and added value; among other matters the discussion in both chapters focuses on the various generation technologies available. For a commodity such as electricity there are limited options for firms to differentiate themselves and use of appropriate technology is seen as one of the best methods to achieve this. A Governance-Strategic Choice framework is proposed in Chapter 4 from the literatures in Chapters 2 and 3 and the propositions derived in these two chapters. A background case on the restructuring and privatisation of the UKESI is included as Appendix A and provides useful material for the development of the nine propositions and this in turn has assisted in the formulation of the GSC Framework in Chapter 4. The qualitative research design of the thesis is discussed in Chapter 5. The design is based on case studies of three electricity supply industries (specifically focused on the generation sectors); Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales in the Australian National Electricity Market. The first case study, in Chapter 6, encompasses the restructuring and privatisation of the Victorian ESI generation sector. The second case study, in Chapter 7, encompasses the restructuring and corporatisation of the Queensland ESI generation sector and the final case study, also in Chapter 7, encompasses the corporatisation of the New South Wales ESI generation sector. It is important to note that the Queensland and New South Wales governments have not yet privatised their respective electricity supply industries. A consequence of this is that some worthwhile comparisons to the privatised Victorian Lucas Skoufa - A Strategic management framework for reformed electricity generation firms in Eastern Australiaindustry have been provided with regards to the strategic behaviours and choices made by electricity generation firms in these industries. Chapter 8 provides analysis of the Governance-Strategic Choice framework (derived in Chapter 4) and the nine propositions (derived in Chapters 2 and 3) by drawing on the three case studies presented in Chapters 6 and 7. Chapter 8 concludes by presenting a section on two strategic scenarios (use of appropriate generation technologies, including environmental considerations, and bundling of products) that are based on the GSC Framework, which provides guidance for strategy formulation for use by generation firms. Chapter 9 sets out the major conclusions of the thesis. In general, generation firms have maintained a majority of coal-fired technologies since privatisation/corporatisation; this situation has changed slightly but not enough considering that in the future greenhouse gas emission limits will most likely be imposed which will disadvantage the coal-fired technologies. Furthermore, risk management has been an important managerial tool for generation firms due to the price volatility experienced in the pool based trading system; in addition, the amount of regulation and regulatory change has been excessive in some cases. The main theoretical contribution of this thesis has been to provide a framework for generation firms to make strategic choices, and highlights two scenarios emanating from this framework for creating and maintaining a competitive advantage in the restructured electricity supply industry environment. For practitioners/senior management the contribution of this thesis is that they will have a better understanding not only of their strategic choices but also the strategic choices of competitors and have the knowledge that, apart from competing on price, there are several other strategic ways through which to create and sustain a competitive advantage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350299 Business and Management not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">660100 Energy Transformation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158062</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service recovery: A re-conceptualisation</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Doan Thuy Thi</field><field name="description">Despite considerable effort by organisations to provide excellent service, service failures occur. Increasingly, as the business environment becomes more dynamic and complex, it is unrealistic to expect service delivery to be completely error free (Bansal and Taylor 1999; Keaveney 1995a). When service failure occurs, firms are advised to put in effort to recover customers, because lost customers typically result in substantial financial and reputational loss (Hogan, Lemon and Libai 2003). Moreover, building relationships with customers is always considered as an ideal approach to avoid customers&#146; dissatisfaction with the recovery attempt. However, it appears that the majority (81%) of customers who complain are not happy with the complaint handling process (TARP 2001). The high percentage of dissatisfied customers suggests that current approaches to recovery are largely ineffective (Davidow 2003). In searching for explanations for the ineffectiveness of service recovery strategies, a programmatic research study was conducted. Study 1 is a qualitative study, including Study 1A and Study 1B. Study 1A was conducted on 199 consumer complaint letters, and Study 1B was conducted using 22 in-depth interviews. Study 2 is a quantitative study conducted on a consumer sample of 431 respondents. Study 2A is a scale development study and Study 2B is a structural equation modelling study. The research program is reported in seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the thesis. Chapter 2 reviews service recovery literature. Chapter 3 outlines the methodology. Chapter 4 reports the results of Study 1. Chapters 5 and 6 report results of Study 2. Finally, Chapter 7 presents the conclusions, key theoretical and managerial implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research. In sum, the thesis proposes a conceptualisation of service recovery by providing a model that highlights the different aspects of the relationships between the following constructs: (1) Customer Recovery Expectations; (2) Purchase Deliberation Recollection; (3) Customer Emotional Attachment; and (4) customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation. Customer Recovery Expectations concept reflects the customer&#146;s perception of an appropriate recovery attempt that they prefer in a particular service recovery context. Purchase Deliberation Recollection reflects the customer&#146;s recalled time and effort invested in the purchase deliberation process. Customer Emotional Attachment captures the emotional connection between the customer and the service provider that motivates the customer to act in the provider&#146;s interest. Lastly, the customer&#146;s Recovery Expectation Disconfirmation describes the customer&#146;s comparison between their preferred recovery solution and their received recovery solution. The relationships between these constructs significantly influence the two dependent variables: the customer&#146;s satisfaction with recovery and their repurchase intention. The findings highlight that, in service recovery, creating a customer&#146;s positive perception of recovery expectation matching attempt is the key. To affect this, employees should understand that the customer has a recovery expectation which the organisation should attempt to match. In addition, customers with a good and long term relationship with the organisation tend to have more sympathy when service failure occurs. However, long term customers may also be more demanding and have higher expectations than short term customers. When the organisation fails to recover the service failure for a long term customer, the negative effect of not appropriately recovering may outweigh the positive benefits of having a relationship. Therefore, once a good relationship has been built, organisations should be prepared to invest more resources to maintain it through time. That is, a relationship should be maintained in normal as well as in service failure situations. The findings thus have significant theoretical and managerial implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158081</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of enacted capabilities on adoption and utilisation of innovative information systems : a study of small- and medium-sized enterprises.</field><field name="creator">Salleh, Noor Akma Mohd</field><field name="description">This thesis is motivated by the need to establish a model covering innovative information systems (IS) adoption behaviours within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Studies on adoption behaviour related to innovative IS are devoting increasing attention to SMEs. Most prior studies, however, have still relied on models developed from studies of large firms. The applicability to SMEs of findings and models developed from large firm studies is not without question as SMEs are not miniature versions of large firms. SMEs face different challenges and opportunities from large firms. This thesis empirically examined issues on the adoption behaviours of innovative IS by SMEs. In line with this objective, two research questions were established. First, what are the critical determinants that allow SMEs to overcome inhibiting factors and adopt an innovative IS? Second, what are the critical determinants that ultimately activate and stimulate them to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS? The conceptualisation of enacted capabilities, adapted from the resource-based view of the firm is introduced. This thesis postulates that appropriate enacted capabilities facilitate SMEs to become enabled and actively utilise an innovative IS. These enacted capabilities include the level of IT skills and knowledge of the enterprises&#146; members, trust in technology, trust in trading partners, external experts&#146; support, and organisational culture Models incorporating aspects of the theory underlying the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989), the diffusion of innovation theory (Rogers, 1995), and the resource-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) were developed to describe the causal linkages between the determinants that activate and stimulate innovative IS adoption behaviour (i.e., from adopting to enabling to utilising innovative IS). One model was developed for the adoption stage and a second for the enablement and utilisation stages. The adoption stage model contains three main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities have a positive direct effect on both perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective. The third hypothesis proposes that perceived net benefits have a positive effect on attitude towards adoption form a competitive advantage perspective. The enablement and utilisation stages model contains four main hypotheses. The first two hypotheses propose that enacted capabilities and attitude have positive effects on perceived net benefits. The last two hypotheses propose that perceived net benefits and attitude towards adoption from a competitive advantage perspective have positive effects on the extent of enablement and usage of innovative IS. The hypotheses are tested using data obtained via a survey and follow-up interview. Responses were received from 206 SMEs of varying industries and sizes from the survey. Out of these 206 SMEs, follow-up interviews were conducted with twenty-one SMEs. The interviews utilise a combination of both open and closed questions. The questions for the follow-up interviews were based on findings derived from the survey. The innovative IS examined was the Malaysian government&#146;s electronic procurement system, known as ePerolehan. All government suppliers must register for the system and become enabled for use before they can start utilising the system. The results indicate that enacted capabilities possessed by SMEs affect perceived net benefits at all stages of adoption behaviours of SMEs (i.e., adoption, enablement and utilisation). More significantly, two aspects of enacted capabilities, top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in trading partners dominate the effect on perceived net benefits. Support from external experts dominates the effect on attitude at the adoption stage. Top management IS skills and knowledge and trust in technology have a negative effect on attitude at the time of adoption. Enacted capabilities also contribute to the extent of enablement and usage within SMEs. Furthermore, different categories of adopters differ in the set of enacted capabilities underlying their innovative IS adoption behaviour. Results also indicate that when SMEs perceived higher net benefits in adopting innovative IS, they have a positive attitude. The positive attitude generated at the time of adoption has a direct effect on the extent of enablement and usage. The influence of perceived net benefits differs at the different stages of adoption behaviour. At the utilisation stage, usage is affected by perceived net benefits, however, perceived net benefits do not affect the extent of enablement at the enablement stage. In conclusion, this thesis found that enacted capabilities display important roles as antecedents to perceived net benefits, and that perceived net benefits act as a mediator from enacted capabilities to attitude at the adoption stage. Enacted capabilities also display important roles as stimulators of the extent of enablement and usage. Thus, apart from requiring good ideas and financial resources, SMEs also require appropriate enacted capabilities when adopting, enabling and utilising innovative IS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350213 Electronic Commerce</field><field name="subject">700299 Information services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">medium business</field><field name="subject">technological innovation</field><field name="subject">organizational behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158058</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling unplanned landscape change: A Colombian case study</field><field name="creator">Etter, Andres</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this study is, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the patterns, processes and drivers of unplanned land cover change in the tropics, using Colombia as a study case.

This has a major impact on natural ecosystems and their function at the local (hundreds of square kilometers) and global scales. The understanding of extent and rate of land cover change is an important issue confronting biodiversity conservation, land use planning, protected area management, and global climate change analysis. Tropical deforestation is the major source of global land cover change, with the highest absolute rates occurring in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where government planning is an important driver of deforestation. However, unplanned deforestation for cropping and ranching is also occurring in Colombia. This is of international concern because Colombia&#146;s diverse ecosystems support high levels of species richness and endemism. Improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers ofland cover change (both deforestation and regeneration) is an important step in developing planning and conservation strategies to address this problem. I applied a spatial and temporal statistical modelling approach to predict changes in land cover in Colombia at the local (100 km2), regional (104 km2) and national (106 km2) levels, with a timeframe spanning from decades to centuries. As dependant variable data, binary forest/non-forest data are used. Explanatory variables comprise biophysical and socioeconomic data sourced from a broad range of information sources, including remotely sensed data from aerial photographs and satellite images, secondary sources of biophysical and socioeconomic data, and historical data. At the local-level, I addressed the deforestation process over the last 60 years using six case studies of 100 km2 of humid lowland forests, by applying logistic regression and spatial analysis. At the regional-level, I studied the deforestation in the Caquet&#225; colonization front of the Colombian Amazon region from 1988-2004 by applying a forest-cover zoning method and logistic regression models to predict deforestation and forest regeneration from biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables. At the national level, I quantified and analysed patterns and drivers of land cover change over the past 500 years for key periods of Colombian history, and identified the extent and duration of impacts on broad ecosystem types. At the national and regional-levels, I also modelled current landscape transformation patterns and predicted areas at a high risk of future deforestation using a joint logistic regression and regression tree approach. I discovered that the rate of deforestation across several lowland regions of Colombia follows a simple sigmoid pattern composed of four phases of transformation: an initial phase of gradual forest loss; an intermediate phase of rapid loss; a second intermediate phase where the rate of decline slows; and a final phase where the forest loss stabilises and is balanced by forest regeneration creating a dynamic equilibrium. At the end of this final phase, the landscape is in a highly transformed state with forest cover stabilizing at 2 to 10% of the original extent and an average forest patch size of 15.4 (&#177; 9.2) ha. As a general rule, the transformed landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of remnant mature tropical forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages that is repeatedly cleared. A second important discovery was that unplanned deforestation in the Colombian Amazon moves as a colonisation wave, extending from population centres. The rate of movement was 0.84 km.yr-1 between 1989 and 2002. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between &#150;1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%. The parallel deforestation and regeneration processes operating within the colonization front showed consistent patterns and rates directly related to the proportion of forest in the neighbourhood, with the highest rates of deforestation occurring in the areas with intermediate (40-60%) forest cover, following an overall quadratic function, and therefore confirming the sigmoid pattern across an entire colonization front. Landscapes with intermediate forest cover also have the highest density of edge habitat, with the deforestation process mimicking the spread of disease. At the national-level, the study reveals two important outcomes. First, there are significant regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of land cover change. The importance of such regional differences in factors explainingland cover change is highlighted by the greatest discrimination ability shown by a regional-level classification tree model. The coefficients and significance of variables in a regional logistic regression model confirmed these differences. Overall, factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) had the strongest influence on the probability of deforestation. The second national-level outcome highlights the need for a longer-term historical perspective spanning centuries to understand present-day landscapes and their level of human impact. The historical analysis reveals that the main drivers of landscape change varied in the early colonial period, with cattle grazing becoming increasingly important, and finally the high impact of economic globalization in the 1990s. The historic land cover maps show the transformed areas increasing from approximately 15 million ha in 1500 to 42 million ha in 2000. Also, during this period, the transformed areas changed from predominantly cropping land uses in 1500 to predominantly (&lt; 75%) grazing in 2000. The research outcomes collectively provide an understanding of the spatial dynamics of unplannedland cover change in tropical forest landscapes, by showing how deforestation and regeneration processes vary along a transformation gradient, and linking the amount of remnant forests is related to the rate of change. The work has implications for policy and management. For example, the method of calculating the movement speed of a colonization front provides a spatially explicit prediction of threat that can be used in conservation planning. The improved understanding of the deforestation and regeneration dynamics over an entire colonization fronts permits more accurate calculation of carbon budgeting for climate change applications. I recommend that future work test of the generalities presented here in both, countries with unplanned deforestation and countries with planned land clearing, to evaluate the effects government controlled planning has on the end result of human transformed landscapes in tropical and subtropical forest regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158178</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isan deformation, magmatism and extensional kinematics in the Western Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Ricky James</field><field name="description">The Mount Isa and May Downs Faults are part of a network of significant faults that define, control, or partition deformation in the Early to mid-Proterozoic Mount Isa Inlier. The middle Proterozoic deformation history includes at least two extensional basin-forming events (Leichhardt Superbasin: ~1800 Ma to ~1700 Ma and Isa Superbasin: ~1700 Ma to ~ 1600 Ma) and a major protracted contractional orogenic event (Isan Orogeny: ~1585 Ma to ~ 1500 Ma). Uplift between the Mount Isa and May Downs Faults during the Isan Orogeny has exposed mid to upper amphibolite facies rocks of the structurally deeper levels of the early rift systems. Also exposed is the Sybella Granite, a composite batholith of variably deformed gneissic granite, which, at ~1660 Ma, is broadly coeval with inception of the Isan Superbasin basin. Two prevailing kinematic models had been proposed for the fault systems during Isan Superbasin formation. The traditionally accepted model involves episodic E-W or NW-SE extension with the N-S Mount Isa Fault, but Southgate et al (2000b) presented an alternative sinistral strike-slip model in which the May Downs Fault acted as a releasing bend fault associated with motion on the Mt Isa Fault. In the Southgate model, the Sybella Granite was interpreted as syn-tectonically filling the dilational releasing bend. This study provides a detailed structural analysis of the 100 km by 40 km area west of Mount Isa City lying between the Mount Isa and May Downs Faults. The aim was to resolve a number of outstanding issues, including those outlined above. The resultant 1:250 000 structural map of the area is based on: reconnaissance-scale mapping; aerial photography, satellite, magnetic and radiometric image interpretation; field observations at locations throughout the area; and local detailed mapping (1:12000 scale or less). The mapping and associated geometrical analysis of the area has shown that the Sybella Batholith consists of two granite sills and a more globular body of microgranite. The deepest, gneissic, sill is up to 5 km thick and was emplaced at about 15 km below the basal Mount Isa Group unconformity (palaeosurface). The other, less deformed, sill formed higher in the crust, and the microgranite intruded to within 1-2 km of the palaeosurface. The two sills are located between two major fault systems (Mount Isa and May Downs Faults) that developed from inherited basin margin faults. The fault systems dip toward each other and the rocks between them have been folded into a single large antiform and uplifted as a wedge. Previous interpretations of the area have suggested that the batholith consists of a single sill folded by tighter, shorter wavelength folds. A cross-sectional reconstruction of the study area suggests that thin-skinned processes dominated much of the Isan Orogeny, contrary to previous interpretations. A three-dimensional reconstruction of the area, evaluated by comparing the predicted strain and amount of shortening with measured strain and shortening estimates, suggests deformation was driven by a rigid block to the west of the May Downs Fault moving toward the northeast. In the restored pre-Isan geometry, both the margins of the lowermost gneissic granite sill and its immediate country rocks have a strong, horizontal, layer-parallel, shear foliation with top-to-the-east asymmetry. The fabrics are strongly constrictional and 2 Abstract the stretching lineation trends east-west. Field observations and thin sectional analysis of these fabrics provide positive evidence that the Sybella Batholith was syn-tectonically emplaced in a basin-forming environment. A kinematic model is presented to show that these features are consistent with granite emplacement into a dilational jog in a sub-horizontal shear zone with a top-to-the-east shear sense. A component of east-west directed horizontal simple shear across the dilating zone explains the strongly constrictional fabrics in the granite. Under these conditions significant north-south shortening in the deforming zone leads to the initiation of folds parallel to the stretching direction (as observed). The shear zone into which the granite was emplaced developed at about fifteen kilometres depth and was probably at or near the brittle-ductile transition. The consistent shear sense, very high strains and implied 30 km of translation required to accommodate the sill indicates that this was a major crustal structure, rather than a simple detachment at the brittle-ductile transition in a crustal pure shear extension. The results are consistent with the east-west extensional model for basin development and totally inconsistent with the sinistral strike-slip model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260107 Structural Geology</field><field name="subject">780104 Earth sciences</field><field name="subject">Mount Isa</field><field name="subject">Sybella Granite</field><field name="subject">Mount Isa Fault</field><field name="subject">May Downs Fault</field><field name="subject">Basin reconstruction</field><field name="subject">kinematics</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158030</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Respect for the world: Universal ethics and the morality of terraforming</field><field name="creator">York, Paul Francis</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to develop an ethical system that can properly frame such questions as the morality of large-scale efforts to transform inanimate parts of nature, for example, proposals to terraform Mars. Such an ethics diverges from traditional approaches to ethics because it expands the class of entities regarded as morally considerable to include inanimate entities. I approach the task by building on the environmental ethical theory of Paul W. Taylor, as developed in his 1986 book Respect for Nature: A Theory of Environmental Ethics. I discuss various criticisms of Taylor and propose two extensions to his theory: an expansion of the scope of moral considerability to include all concrete material objects and the introduction of the concept of variable moral significance (the notion that all entities have inherent worth but some have more than others). Using Taylor&#146;s modified and extended theory as a foundation, I develop something I call universal ethics. This is an ethical framework whose key elements are a fundamental ethical attitude of respect for the world and a principle of minimal harm. Universal ethics regards all concrete material entities, whether living or not, and whether natural or artefactual, as inherently valuable, and therefore as entitled to the respect of moral agents. I offer a defence of this ethical framework and discuss a number of practical applications, including criticism of proposals for the terraforming of Mars. I conclude that terraforming Mars or any other celestial body at this point in our history would be morally wrong. I also suggest that universal ethics provides an ethical foundation for efforts to protect Antarctica, and that it has implications for our relations to other inanimate parts of our world, including artefacts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="subject">440103 Ethical Theory</field><field name="subject">environmental philosophy</field><field name="subject">environmental ethics</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">inherent worth</field><field name="subject">complexity</field><field name="subject">integrity</field><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">moral considerability</field><field name="subject">moral significance</field><field name="subject">moral standing</field><field name="subject">principle of minimal harm</field><field name="subject">imperative to knowledge</field><field name="subject">Mars</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">inanimate nature</field><field name="subject">artefacts</field><field name="subject">vandalism</field><field name="subject">extraterrestrial</field><field name="subject">Paul W Taylor</field><field name="subject">anthropocentrism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First-principles quantum simulations of many-mode open interacting Bose gases using stochastic gauge methods</field><field name="creator">Deuar, Piotr Pawel</field><field name="description">The quantum dynamics and grand canonical thermodynamics of many-mode (one-, two-, and three-dimensional) interacting Bose gases are simulated from first principles. The model uses a lattice Hamiltonian based on a continuum second-quantized model with two-particle interactions, external potential, and interactions with an environment, with no further approximations. The interparticle potential can be either an (effective) delta function as in Bose-Hubbard models, or extended with a shape resolved by the lattice. Simulations are of a set of stochastic equations that in the limit of many realizations correspond exactly to the full quantum evolution of the many-body systems. These equations describe the evolution of samples of the gauge P distribution of the quantum state, details of which are developed. Conditions under which general quantum phase-space representations can be used to derive stochastic simulation methods are investigated in detail, given the criteria: 1) The simulation corresponds exactly to quantum mechanics in the limit of many trajectories. 2) The number of equations scales linearly with system size, to allow the possibility of efficient first-principles quantum mesoscopic simulations. 3) All observables can be calculated from one simulation. 4) Each stochastic realization is independent to allow straightforward use of parallel algorithms. Special emphasis is placed on allowing for simulation of open systems. In contrast to typical Monte Carlo techniques based on path integrals, the phase-space representation approach can also be used for dynamical calculations. Two major (and related) known technical stumbling blocks with such stochastic simulations are instabilities in the stochastic equations, and pathological trajectory distributions as the boundaries of phase space are approached. These can (and often do) lead to systematic biases in the calculated observables. The nature of these problems are investigated in detail. Many phase-space distributions have, however, more phase-space freedoms than the minimum required for exact correspondence to quantum mechanics, and these freedoms can in many cases be exploited to overcome the instability and boundary term problems, recovering an unbiased simulation. The stochastic gauge technique, which achieves this in a systematic way, is derived and heuristic guidelines for its use are developed. The gauge P representation is an extension of the positive P distribution, which uses coherent basis states, but allows a variety of useful stochastic gauges that are used to overcome the stability problems. Its properties are investigated, and the resulting equations to be simulated for the open interacting Bose gas system are derived. The dynamics of the following many-mode systems are simulated as examples: 1) Uniform one-dimensional and two-dimensional Bose gases after the rapid appearance of significant two-body collisions (e.g. after entering a Feshbach resonance). 2) Trapped bosons, where the size of the trap is of the same order as the range of the interparticle potential. 3) Stimulated Bose enhancement of scattered atom modes during the collision of two Bose-Einstein condensates. The grand canonical thermodynamics of uniform one-dimensional Bose gases is also calculated for a variety of temperatures and collision strengths. Observables calculated include first to third order spatial correlation functions (including at finite interparticle separation) and momentum distributions. The predicted phenomena are discussed. Improvements over the positive P distribution and other methods are discussed, and simulation times are analyzed for Bose-Hubbard lattice models from a general perspective. To understand the behavior of the equations, and subsequently optimize the gauges for the interacting Bose gas, single- and coupled two-mode dynamical and thermodynamical models of interacting Bose gases are investigated in detail. Directions in which future progress can be expected are considered. Lastly, safeguards are necessary to avoid biased averages when exponentials of Gaussian-like trajectory distributions are used (as here), and these are investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780102 Physical sciences</field><field name="subject">Bose-Einstein condensate</field><field name="subject">quantum mechanics</field><field name="subject">stochastic methods</field><field name="subject">positive P representation</field><field name="subject">Bose gas</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158009</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deepening democracy? A study of democracy education programs in Thailand</field><field name="creator">King, Deborah</field><field name="description">The constitution enacted in 1997 in Thailand contains many provisions for the Thai people to participate in decision making processes, exercise their civil rights and hold elected and public officials accountable. However, the people most in need of these reforms have little practical knowledge of their rights and liberties under this constitution. This thesis investigates the potential of democracy programs to enhance levels of citizen participation and awareness of democratic rights, and in this sense, deepen the procedural democracy established with the constitution in Thailand. Existing democratisation literature largely takes a macro, institutional approach. There is limited academic analysis of the micro aspects of how people acquire practical knowledge about their democratic rights in a way that can be of assistance in their daily lives. This thesis elaborates some of the relatively minute aspects of democratic deepening, of which there is a paucity within existing research. The dissertation pursues these concerns by investigating questions about how democracy is taught, who is doing the educating and why. Two different democracy education programs located in Isan, the northeast of Thailand, are examined as case studies. These programs are analyzed employing criteria drawn from an analysis of the characteristics of democratic deepening. A subsidiary line of inquiry is also applied to investigate whether there is a better general approach to take in democracy education, top down or bottom up. The first case study looks at the activities of two centres under the Parliament-Social Community Collaborative Activities Centre program of King Prajadhipok&#146;s Institute. The second case study examines two of the pilot courses of the Civic Participation in Local Governance curriculum. The research establishes the potential for democracy education programs to contribute to democratic deepening in Thailand. Nevertheless, enhancement of citizen participation and awareness of rights in a manner that is effective at personal and community levels is contingent upon a number of conditions. While the research confirms the importance of bottom up approaches to democracy education, it demonstrates that these approaches can emerge in a top down structure. Conversely, it was found that bottom up project design has the capacity for distortion. Contrary to the expectations of the research it was observed that the individual attitudes of the trainers or facilitators were as, if not more, important than project design. As well as providing another contribution to contemporary Thai studies, this research extends that part of the democratisation literature that focuses on the practical aspects of democratic deepening. It will also help inform public policy makers and debates over social capital, civil society and the appropriate boundaries of the public sphere.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360100 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Local Information Center for Development (LICD)</field><field name="subject">informal institutions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158004</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists: From systems design to a randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Russell, Trevor Glen</field><field name="description">High quality health services are often difficult to access in rural and remote areas of Australia. This is due to a shortage of health care professionals and specialists, inadequate and poorly distributed resources, and the tyranny of distance. The result is a reduced level of health and a higher mortality rate than seen in urban communities. Telemedicine, which is the use of various technologies to deliver a range of health care services over a distance, has the potential to increase equity and access to health care in rural and remote areas. To date there has been a poor uptake of telemedicine technology within the profession of physiotherapy. This undoubtedly stems from the perceived, and indeed, real difficulty of performing what is traditionally &#145;hands on&#146; therapy, via an electronic medium. Added to this is a paucity of rigorous clinical outcome studies to demonstrate the efficacy of performing successful treatment via this delivery method. The aim of this thesis was to establish the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. To achieve this, the first major undertaking was the development of a telemedicine system to meet the unique needs of clinical physiotherapists and their patients. A series of studies was then performed to calibrate the system and establish its validity and reliability as a clinical assessment tool. Finally, a randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The telemedicine system was constructed using a human systems development approach, with close consultation with senior clinical physiotherapists and potential users of the system. The personal computer-based system was designed to connect patients in their home with physiotherapists in the hospital, via low-speed and low-cost communications. The system incorporated real-time videoconferencing and physical measurement tools to enable the remote assessment of patients. The validity and reliability of the telemedicine physical measurement tools were established through a series of five studies. The results demonstrated these measurements to be accurate and reliable, under various measurement conditions, when compared to reference instruments. A prospective randomised controlled trial was conducted to assess the treatment efficacy of the telemedicine system. The research model chosen for this study was the rehabilitation of subjects who had undergone total knee replacement surgery. Block randomisation was used to assign 65 participants to either a traditional face-to-face therapy group or a telemedicine rehabilitation group. Participants in both groups received treatment over a six week period. Data analysis focussed on comparing physical and functional rehabilitation outcomes achieved in each treatment group. The results of this study demonstrated that the rehabilitation outcomes produced via the telemedicine system were similar to those achieved in the traditional manner. Additionally, the telemedicine therapy was found to produce greater improvements in a number of functional outcome measurements. A high level of satisfaction was expressed by participants who received treatment via the telemedicine method. This thesis provides evidence of the efficacy of telemedicine as a clinical tool for physiotherapists. Furthermore, the work detailed in this thesis represents one of the first randomised control trials in telerehabilitation and makes a significant contribution towards the knowledge of low-bandwidth telemedicine in general. This thesis provides a framework upon which further research and telemedicine applications may be developed, with the ultimate goal of improving equity and access to high quality health services in rural and remote areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">telerehabilitation</field><field name="subject">telehealth</field><field name="subject">physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">physical therapy</field><field name="subject">rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">total knee replacement</field><field name="subject">total knee arthroplasty</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">remote</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157964</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater dynamics and the salinity structure in sandy beaches</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Nick</field><field name="description">Groundwater dynamics in beaches have been investigated through field and laboratory experiments. The observations have been used to test the ability of currently available mathematical and numerical models to adequately account for the influence of processes such as vertical flow and capillarity. New 1D sand column experiments have been conducted to examine the influence of a truncated capillary fringe on periodic water table oscillations. As the fringe becomes increasingly truncated the aquifer storage term, the complex effective porosity n &#969;, is substantially reduced in agreement with previous findings under steady flow conditions. The findings are a useful starting point for an investigation of the dynamics of the water table exit point in beaches where the water table lies just below the sand surface. A simple 2D laboratory aquifer, influenced by finite-depth and capillarity effects, subject to simple harmonic periodic forcing has been used to investigate the dispersion of the water table waves. The performance of existing dispersion relation theories, accounting for both capillarity and finite-depth effects, deteriorates at higher oscillation frequencies suggesting that other, neglected processes have some influence. Horizontal flow in the capillary fringe is suggested as such a process. The generation of higher harmonics due to a sloping beach face is also investigated in the laboratory. The observations reveal that the generation process is strongest near the sand surface, likely to be due to vertical flows into the aquifer being strongest near the sand surface. A 2DV numerical model is applied to the data and does well in predicting the nature of the generation process, qualitatively reproducing the variation in oscillation amplitude with depth in the inter-tidal zone. Application of a modified Boussinesq equation to estimate aquifer recharge due to infiltration from wave runup is critically applied to field and laboratory measurements. Finite amounts of flux across the water table are seen at, and landward of, the runup limit where there is zero infiltration at the sand surface. This suggests that the capillary fringe and vertical flows in this region are significant and that application of the model be undertaken with care. Field observations of the salinity structure and its response to ocean forcing reveal no response to tidal forcing but a significant response to a wave-induced pulse in groundwater levels. The infiltration of salty ocean water due to infiltration from wave runup is shown to reverse the traditional &#147;salt-wedge&#148; scenario in the surficial aquifer with a thin salty layer overlying the fresh water.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290801 Structural Engineering</field><field name="subject">680203 Civil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158177</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the epidemiology and molecular biology of Koala retrovirus (KoRV)</field><field name="creator">Tarlinton, R.

While endogenous viruses are very common with up to 8% of the human genome consisting of retroviral material they are usually mutated and inactive (Gifford and Tristem 2002). KoRV possessed a full length replication competent genome, was actively transcribed and produced viral particles. KoRV was also very closely related to the exogenous (horizontally transmitted) retrovirus of Gibbons (Gibbon ape leukaemia virus or GaLV). Normally closely related viruses are found in closely related species. This unusual similarity between KoRV and GaLV raised the possibility of a recent host species jump (Hanger et al 2000). This thesis makes a case for the recent introduction of KoRV into the koala genome and ongoing endogenisation into the koala genome. KoRV is demonstrated definitively as an endogenous virus but present at a mixed prevalence within the Australian koala population. The thesis also further characterizes KoRV&#146;s activity and establishes an association between KoRV and disease in koalas. It is difficult to prove that a virus present in all animals in a population (as is the case for most endogenous viruses) is the cause of a particular disease syndrome. Here real time PCR was used to quantify the level of viraemia and proviral DNA load in the blood of individuals. A significant association between high viral load and leukaemia and lymphoma was demonstrated. This was further confirmed in a follow up study of a group of animals where those with a high viral RNA level were at a greater risk of dying from neoplasia. The real time PCR study also indicated that animals suffering from clinical chlamydiosis had higher viral RNA levels than their healthy counterparts though this was not significant. This disease association was further strengthened when KoRV free populations were identified and were shown to have lower incidences of these diseases. The real time PCR studies demonstrated a considerable variation in the proviral copy number in individual animals. With most endogenous retroviruses the proviral copy number is fixed within the species or population (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Southern blotting was used to confirm this variation in copy number and also demonstrated variation in the pattern of these proviral inserts between unrelated animals. The random insertion pattern of KoRV provirus loci was further confirmed using cytogenetics. Sequencing of the KoRV envelope gene revealed marked variation in sequence within individual animals. These sequences despite considerable mutation in some cases were all potentially functional and indicate positive selection pressure for active virus within the individual animals. Inverse PCR was used to identify the koala genomic sequence interrupted by the proviral loci. While koala genomic sequence was successfully amplified no potential oncogenes were found. This study did however demonstrate the presence of truncated KoRV sequences missing a large part of the gagpro- pol gene. Electron microscopy also demonstrated KoRV viral particles in the bone marrow of a leukaemic animal. KoRV had originally been classified as an endogenous virus based on the fact that it was present in all animals tested and in all tissues of individual animals. However the accepted definition of an endogenous virus is one that is present in the germ line DNA and is inherited over several generations (Boeke and Stoye 1997). Single cell PCR of koala sperm was used to demonstrate that KoRV is present in germ line DNA. This was confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. Southern blotting of blood obtained from a group of related captive animals showed the inheritance of proviral loci over several generations. To determine whether all koalas carried KoRV loci, samples from geographically diverse populations were obtained. As expected all animals in Queensland were positive for KoRV using PCR techniques. Unexpectedly animals from Kangaroo Island in South Australia were free of KoRV. Samples obtained from Victorian animals demonstrated a mixed KoRV status. The animals on Kangaroo Island have been isolated from other populations since the 1920&#146;s and this raises the possibility that KoRV has integrated into the mainland koala population during the last 100 years. This is unprecedented for an endogenous virus with the most recent estimate for integration in other species being the type C viruses of pigs 5000 years ago (Mang et al 2001). The mixed prevalence of KoRV and its high activity indicate that this virus is still undergoing the process of endogenisation and provides a unique opportunity to study this process in a wild animal population.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270303 Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158074</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of molten metal surface properties on the formation of surface defects on vertical direct chill cast aluminium alloy products.</field><field name="creator">Bainbridge, Ian Frank</field><field name="description">The DC casting process used for the production of cast aluminium alloy products intended for processing by rolling, extrusion or forging is an economically important process with approximately 10 million tonnes of DC cast product being produced annually world wide [1]. Process productivity, particularly with respect to elimination of casting defects and hence process scrap is an important factor to DC cast product producers. The literature reporting the DC casting process, particularly with respect to the formation of defects on the cast surface, is reviewed and the mechanisms for the formation of such defects examined. A universally understood and accepted explanation was found for only one of the normal surface defects encountered in practice. A number of samples of commercially cast DC products were subject to detailed cast surface examination, particularly surface microstructures. The results of this examination and the literature survey identified molten metal surface tension as a possible contributing factor affecting the molten metal meniscus stability within the DC casting mould. Meniscus instability is linked with the formation of surface defects. The literature on surface tension of aluminium alloys provided only limited information hence the surface tension of a range of binary and ternary alloys, including commercial alloys was determined, producing data hitherto not available. Of the common alloying elements used in commercial aluminium alloys, iron and magnesium were found to significantly reduce the surface tension. Surface fracture also resulted in a reduction in surface tension for the majority of alloys tested. The surface tension data is combined with mould thermal and physical model calculations to propose a mechanism for the formation of the cast surface defects. The model proposes a maximum stable size for the meniscus according to the alloy and mould conditions. Conditions outside these limits result in meniscus instability and the formation of cast surface defects. The model suggests possible operating changes that may reduce the incidence of surface defect formation. The work also identifies a number of areas requiring further investigation before major practical process changes aimed at cast surface defect elimination, may be formulated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DC Casting</field><field name="subject">Surface Tension</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158035</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Micro-Intonation and the viola: a study of just intonation, the pythagorean scale and equal temperament in relation to the performance of unaccompanied viola repertoire.</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Linda Catherine</field><field name="description">This discussion examines just intonation, the Pythagorean scale and equal temperament in relation to string playing and explores ways that intervals from these systems of temperament can be used to enhance the acoustic and expressive qualities of an unaccompanied performance on viola.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158386</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control of an articulating flexible structure using MIMO QFT</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Murray Lawrence</field><field name="description">Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is a control system design methodology founded on the premise that feedback is necessary only because of system uncertainty. Articulating flexible structures, such as flexible manipulators, present a difficult closed-loop control problem. In such servo systems, the coupling of the rigid and flexible modes and the non-minimum phase dynamics severely limit system stability and performance. The difficulties in controlling these structures is exacerbated by the denumerably infinite number of flexible modes and associated difficulties in developing accurate dynamic models for controller design. As such, the control of articulating flexible structures presents a non-trivial testbed for the design of QFT based robust control systems. This dissertation examines the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) QFT based control of an articulating flexible structure and presents an enhancement of the theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT design methodologies. The control problem under consideration is the active vibration control of an articulating single-link flexible manipulator. This is facilitated by an actuation scheme comprised of a combination of spatially discrete actuation, in the form of a DC motor to perform articulation, and spatially distributed actuation, in the form of a piezoelectric transducer for active vibration control. In the process of developing and experimentally validating the QFT based control system, shortcomings in the theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT design methodologies are addressed. Robust stability theorems are developed for the two main MIMO QFT design methodologies, namely the sequential and non-sequential MIMO QFT design methodologies. The theorems complement and extend the existing theoretical basis for the MIMO QFT design methodologies. The dissertation results expose salient features of the MIMO QFT design methodologies and provide connections to other multivariable design methodologies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230119 Systems Theory and Control</field><field name="subject">671401 Scientific instrumentation</field><field name="subject">QFT</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Multivariable Control</field><field name="subject">Robust Control</field><field name="subject">Flexible Manipulator</field><field name="subject">Piezoelectric</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158000</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Validation of a CFD Solver for Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Elford, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">In this thesis the validation of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code against published experimental data and alternative CFD results is explored. Six case studies are presented with flow speeds ranging from mid supersonic to hypersonic. The studies include complex compressible flow phenomena such as the interaction of shockwaves with boundary layers, vortices and other shockwaves. Two of the six validation cases also consider complex thermodynamic behaviour such as vibrational and chemical nonequilibrium. The problems chosen are limited in scope to flows which are planar or axisymmetric and remain laminar throughout the region of flow studied. This allows the studies to focus on simulating the fundamental behaviour of the flow without the added complication of turbulence or the need for large scale computing facilities. The problems which arose during the validation studies and a background to why they occurred and, wherever possible, strategies to avoid their occurrence are discussed. General modelling strategies in compressible CFD are also discussed. In this thesis the software suite CFD-FASTRAN is used to construct and analyse the CFD models.

Understanding these two processes is crucial for the conservation of wildlife populations in landscapes impacted by human land-use. Approximately 50% of the subtropical rainforest in South East Queensland, Australia has been lost to deforestation over the last 100 years. While large areas of rainforest are reserved, little is known about the distribution and population status of rainforest birds within smaller remnants in the region. The overall research problem for this thesis was to understand how deforestation and fragmentation of subtropical rainforest affects the occurrence of rainforest birds and the effective dispersal of a rainforest-restricted species, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Understanding why some bird species are lost from habitat patches while others remain will lead to improved conservation of extinction prone species in fragmented landscapes. Although the mechanisms underlying local extinctions are well established in temperate systems, the relative importance of local and regional processes on species occurrence in subtropical and tropical rainforests is poorly understood. Chapter 2 investigated the relative effects of life history and scale of habitat modification on avian site occupancy using observational data collected at 46 rainforest sites in South East Queensland. A probabilistic model for the joint site occupancy of 29 bird species was used to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of avian life history traits on the occurrence of multiple species. The single-species occurrence models incorporated habitat effects on detection, which may be especially important in rainforests because dense vegetation and idiosyncratic occurrence of species can interfere with sampling. Occupancy rates for each species were modelled to determine the relative influence of process operating at the stand, landscape and patch scales. The life history analysis indicated taxonomic Family, body mass, migratory strategy and feeding strata had large effects on avian site occupancy, whereas abundance traits such as mean density and extent of occurrence showed little predictive ability. After accounting for correlated extinction risk attributed to life history, the degradation of stand structure at the local scale was more important for species richness than habitat modification at landscape or patch scales. While individual species showed various responses to the different scales of habitat modification, the distribution of many species was limited by vegetation structure at the landscape scale. Maintaining stand basal area and restoring degraded rainforests at the local scale will increase the probability of occupancy for members of the rainforest bird community. However, revegetation and retention of forest cover at the landscape scale may be necessary for the successful colonisation of many species. Chapter 3 introduced a predictive hypothesis-driven approach for quantifying the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. Current analytic frameworks in population genetics have difficulty evaluating meaningful hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. Confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes allowed the identification of dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. Two measures of indirect gene flow were estimated from microsatellite polymorphism among 11 logrunner populations. Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in a reconstructed historic landscape and a contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from non-independent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternate hypotheses. The historic and contemporary landscapes explained an equal proportion of variation in genetic differentiation and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. Migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. Landscape heterogeneity appeared to facilitate gene flow prior to European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal. Understanding asymmetric dispersal is becoming an important consideration for the conservation metapopulations. Populations acting as net exporters of dispersing animals may be able to rescue local populations from extinction and allow metapopulations to persist in degraded landscapes impacted by habitat loss. In Chapter 4, I estimated bidirectional migration rates from genetic data to infer dispersal among 11 logrunner populations. The first question posed was, does logrunner dispersal correspond to the source-sink or balanced model of dispersal? The second question involved determining the strength of evidence for two hypotheses about how landscape structure has affected asymmetric dispersal. Hypothesis one proposed that asymmetric dispersal was primarily influenced by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Hypothesis two asserted that asymmetric dispersal was predominantly influenced by anthropogenic landscape change. The data were confronted with the alternate hypotheses using linear mixed models and landscape covariates extracted from digital maps. The results showed the direction of asymmetric dispersal was consistent with source-sink population structure. I also discovered that the asymmetry in dispersal was influenced more by anthropogenic landscape change than by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Intact landscapes were net exporters of dispersing logrunners while landscapes heavily impacted by rainforest clearing were net importers of individuals. Elevated immigration rates into landscapes impacted by rainforest clearing appeared to arrest population declines in accordance with the rescue effect. The primary conclusion emerging from the study of patch occupancy and dispersal was that logrunner populations in South East Queensland conformed to a mainland-island metapopulation. Asymmetric dispersal from the largest expanse of upland rainforest appeared to prevent fragmented rainforests in close proximity from going locally extinct. While the distribution of logrunners was limited by the spatial configuration of rainforest patches, other rainforest birds exhibited variable responses to scale of habitat modification. The most consistent pattern was several species dropping-out of the community in degraded stands affected by selective timber harvest. Deforestation at the landscape scale also played a role in the extremely low patch occupancy rates of Albert&#8217;s lyrebirds (Menura alberti) and green catbirds (Ailuroedus crassirostris).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric dispersal, bird conservation, coalescent theory, forest fragmentation, gene flow, habitat loss, life history, migration, notophyll vine forest, species richness.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159461</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What Happens to &#8216;Big Ideas&#8217; at the Front Line of Human Services : The Case of Service User Rights</field><field name="creator">Crane, Phil R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">370000 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165168</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories from the Hidden Heart of &#8220;sacred violence&#8221;: An exploration of violence and Christian faith in East Timor in dialogue with Ren&#233; Girard's mimetic insight</field><field name="creator">Joel Hodge</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores how Christian faith affected the hope and resistance of an oppressed people in their response to violence orchestrated against them. It undertakes this task through stories collected from the people of East Timor, a half-island nation located in South-East Asia that was brutally ruled by Indonesia from 1975 to 1999. The nature of Christian faith is a vexed question for the modern world particularly when this faith has grown in countries like East Timor where suffering, violence and oppression were inflicted on the people. This lack of understanding of the nature and development of Christian faith is evident in academic studies of East Timor. Moreover, the difficult nature of this question is compounded by the fact that the violence and oppression, such as that inflicted on the East Timorese, is often orchestrated by the nation-state, which itself is a creation of the modern West. Faith in these circumstances of violence is often explained away as a circumstantial reaction after which the people will return to the path of reason. Yet, this attitude is problematic in the way it juxtaposes reason and faith. It ultimately exposes an unsound anthropological understanding of the human person as well as a view of reason that is narrow and insufficient as it sees reason as unable to cope with the circumstances of violence. This dissertation argues for an understanding of faith and violence through an analysis of the experiences of the East Timorese. This analysis is undertaken from an anthropological and theological understanding of the human person, primarily based on the insights of Ren&#233; Girard which provide clarity in understanding the relationship between human being, reason and faith. This dissertation argues that Christian faith helped the East Timorese people confront the existential and anthropological challenges posed by violence, and so, enabled them to overcome the illusions and false transcendence of violence, which Girard (1977, 31) says &#8220;&#8230;is the heart and secret soul of the sacred&#8221;. The dissertation shows that Christian faith helped form purpose, hope and non-violent resistance to state-sanctioned violence in East Timor through the anthropological, existential and imaginative resources fostered in relationship with Christ. The dissertation proposes an explanation of the experiences of the East Timorese recounted in this dissertation that posits that relationship with and faith in Christ, as the self-giving and victimised &#8220;Other&#8221;, had a discernible and plausible effect on the East Timorese particularly in the circumstances of violence. This faith commitment seemed to change and free persons and cultural structures in East Timor from the violent transcendence imposed by the dictatorial state that presents itself as &#8220;sacred&#8221;. This freedom emerged as the oppressed and victimised East Timorese, through their experience of the violent depths of human relations, were directed toward the pacific transcendence located around the victim, Christ, the substance of which is Christ&#8217;s self-giving love originating from and shared with the Father through the Spirit. East Timorese people were directed and responded to Christ in faith as they encountered the self-giving mimesis of the Trinity sacramentally and through the martyrs. This faith formed a new ontological way, or direction, which fostered resistance to the sacred violence of the state and their supporters. Through the enactment of their faith in this new and pacific way of being in self-giving mimesis, the Christian community in East Timor sought to resist and transform the state into a more benign and responsive entity by exposing and removing its ability to arbitrarily and indiscriminately victimise and oppress. This ecclesiological stance sought to expose the truth in the midst of the lies of sacred violence through a pacific way of being that was learnt from communion with the risen Christ as self-giving victim.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Girard</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Christian faith</field><field name="subject">Mimetic theory</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178623</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anti-pronation tape: Initial effects on neuromotor control of gait, foot posture and foot mobility and the influence of continual use</field><field name="creator">Melinda Franettovich</field><field name="description">Anti-pronation taping is commonly used by clinicians in the management of lower limb musculoskeletal pain and injury. Despite its frequent use in the clinical setting the mechanism(s) underlying its efficacy is not completely understood. For example, there is evidence that anti-pronation taping produces a biomechanical effect, but there has been little investigation of other mechanisms such as neurophysiological or psychological effects. Additionally, studies to date have been performed in mostly asymptomatic populations and have focused on the initial effect of tape (i.e. immediately following application and through a short duration of activity). Improved understanding of the underlying physiological mechanism(s) of anti-pronation tape is likely to facilitate improved knowledge of the technique, which may optimise its clinical application and contribute to clinical selection guidelines. The aims of this thesis were developed to address several of the limitations in the current anti-pronation taping literature. To facilitate an investigation of the comparative initial physiological effect of anti-pronation tape in a symptomatic and asymptomatic population, the first aim of this thesis was to compare neuromotor control (control of muscle activation and movement patterns) of gait, foot posture and foot mobility between asymptomatic individuals and individuals with a history of exercise related leg pain. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate the initial physiological effects of anti-pronation tape, specifically its neurophysiological (i.e. effect on muscle activation patterns) and biomechanical (i.e. effect on movement patterns, foot posture, foot mobility) effects. Thirdly this thesis aimed to investigate the duration of these initial physiological effects following tape removal. The fourth and fifth aims were to investigate the long term biomechanical and neurophysiological effects of anti-pronation taping i.e. following continual use over a clinically relevant period. In the first instance our aim was to investigate the effect of continual use on neuromotor control of gait, foot posture and foot mobility, and secondly to investigate the effect of continual use on the technique&#8217;s initial neurophysiological and biomechanical effects. Individuals with exercise related leg pain demonstrated lower activation of gluteus medius and lateral gastrocnemius during gait, but we observed no differences in lower limb movement patterns or foot posture and foot mobility between the two groups. The initial effect of tape was similar in individuals with and without exercise related leg pain. Specifically application of tape produced a reduction in activation of tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius, and increased activation of peroneus longus. There was a reduction in foot mobility, ankle plantarflexion and abduction excursion and an increase in ankle dorsiflexion and adduction excursion. Reduced muscle activation and increased motion was also observed at more proximal segments (knee, hip, pelvis), but were of smaller magnitude than at the foot and ankle. Changes in foot mobility, ankle kinematics and leg muscle activity did not continue following the removal of tape, but at more proximal segments (i.e. pelvis, hip and knee) small changes in kinematics and muscle activity were observed following the removal of tape. In regards to long term effects, continual use of tape for approximately 12 days produced a small increase in arch height when compared to a control. We did not observe a change in muscle activation or motion patterns, nor did continual use of the technique influence its initial neurophysiological or biomechanical effects (i.e. reduction in muscle activity, reduction in foot mobility, altered lower limb motion). The studies from this thesis provide evidence that anti-pronation tape should be considered in the management of individuals where reduced midfoot mobility, control of ankle motion or reduced activation of the leg muscles is desired, regardless of symptomatic status. When applied for approximately 12 days, anti-pronation tape produced a small increase in arch height ratio, but no alteration in neuromotor control. We are not aware of any definitive data on what constitutes a clinically meaningful increase in arch height, but results from a published case series suggests that our findings of a small increase in arch height may be clinically relevant for the treatment of lower extremity overuse injuries. Continual use of tape for a clinically relevant period does not alter its initial effects on foot posture and mobility or neuromotor control during gait. It would appear that the initial effects of anti-pronation tape are robust even after continuous use over a period of 11 days.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lower Limb</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Gait analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200607</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the potential of mesenchymal stromal cells to attenuate graft-versus-host disease</field><field name="creator">Melinda Elise Christensen</field><field name="description">Survival of patients with poor prognosis or relapsed haematopoietic malignancies can be markedly improved by allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT reconstitutes the immune and haematopoietic systems after myeloablative conditioning and inhibits the recurrence of the malignancy by a graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) response mediated by donor T cells. However, significant post-transplant complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) continue to plague the event-free survival of this curative procedure. GVHD is facilitated by donor T cells that recognise histocompatibility antigens on host antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC). Current treatment options for GVHD are focused on these T cells. However, these treatments result in an increased incidence of infection, graft rejection and relapse. A novel means of immunosuppression in GVHD is the use of multi-potent, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). MSC are non-immunogenic cells that actively suppress T cell function in vitro, and can resolve steroid-refractory GVHD in the clinic. Despite their use in the clinic, there is a paucity of pre-clinical data. Our aim was to investigate the in vivo efficacy of MSC to control GVHD while maintaining the beneficial GVL effect, and to begin to understand the mechanism by which MSC exert their immunosuppressive effects. We isolated and characterised MSC from murine bone/bone marrow and demonstrated that they suppressed T cell proliferation in vitro, even at low ratios of 1 MSC per 100 T cells. This was true of both donor-derived MSC, and MSC derived from unrelated donors (third party). Importantly, we observed that MSC significantly reduced T cell production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; in culture supernatants and that IFN&#947; plays a key role in the ability of MSC to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, we examined the effects of donor-derived MSC on GVHD severity and onset in two myeloablative murine models of HSCT. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used as a proof&#8211;of-principle model [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB/c (H-2d)], and an MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used to mimic MHC-matched sibling transplantation [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB.B (H-2b)]. We examined a number of variables related to MSC infusion including timing, dose and route of injection. We found that early post transplant infusion of MSC by the intraperitoneal injection was most effective at delaying death from GVHD, compared to pre-transplant infusion or intravenous injection. Furthermore, we found that the dose of MSC was critical, as infusion of too few MSC was ineffective and infusion of too many MSC exacerbated the development of GVHD. Taken together, these results suggest that timing, dose and route of injection are all important factors to be considered to ensure successful therapeutic outcome. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of action, we conducted timed sacrifice experiments in the MHC-mismatched model to determine if MSC altered cytokine secretion and cellular effectors, such as DC, known to play a key role in GVHD. Despite the fact that MSC given post-HSCT enter an environment full of activated DC and IFN&#947; levels, by day 3 and 6 post infusion, these activated DC and IFN&#947; levels are decreased compared to controls or mice infused with MSC pre-transplant (p&lt;0.05). This confirmed our in vitro data that IFN&#947; played an important role in MSC-mediated immunosuppression. In addition, when we removed a major source of IFN&#947; production in vivo by administering the T cell depleting antibody KT3 to mice with or without MSC, we found that although T cell depletion prolonged survival, MSC were unable to further enhance this effect. This was also true when MSC were used in combination with the conventional immunosuppressant cyclosporine. Finally, we examined whether the infusion of MSC would compromise the GVL effect. We found that whilst MSC could delay the onset of GVHD, in our model they did not alter the anti-tumour effects of the donor T cells. Overall, we have shown that MSC can delay but not prevent death from GVHD when administered at an appropriate time and dose and that IFN&#947; is required for MSC-mediated immunosuppression in our model. These data suggest that patients undergoing HSCT should be monitored for IFN&#947;, and administered MSC when high levels are reached. Whilst MSC may be a promising therapy for patients with severe GVHD, we highlight that further investigation is warranted before MSC are accepted for widespread use in the clinic. The risks and benefits for transplant recipients should be carefully considered before utilising MSC to treat or prevent GVHD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</field><field name="subject">Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)</field><field name="subject">Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)</field><field name="subject">Interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205786</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Pathways for Elite Coaching: A Study of Australian Softball Coaches</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Horton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the attributes and experiences that are perceived priorities for recruitment to become a high performance coach in the sport of Softball in Australia. The study was undertaken in the form of 10 cases of nationally identified coaches and administrators (men and women). Each participant was interviewed using semi-structured questions. The interpretive study gave an intensive description and analysis of coach experiences, attributes and qualifications that are perceived as highly desirable for coach selection by Softball Australia for high performance coaches. The basis for collection and analysis of information was via individual cognitive perspectives and perceptions (through interviews) and individual behaviours (through observation) with the intention to interpret and consider the presence of common themes. Findings may serve to identify, support and direct potential high performance coaches and contribute to the effectiveness of formal coaching education programs. The study focused on the sport of softball which has had a mixed profile over time, from one of almost obscurity to that of an Olympic sport. Australia has had an extremely impressive record internationally. It is currently ranked as the world&#8217;s best softball nation based on international performances by the Australian under 19 Men, Open Men, under 19 Women and Open Women&#8217;s Teams (SA 2008). Australia was the only country ranked in the top three in all age groups competing in World Championships. The importance of this study to softball coaches was to encapsulate the reality of how selectors make determination on performance coaching selections, and was this in line with what performance coaches perceive as the priorities. This may have two direct effects on the performance coach. Firstly, it may allow the coach to develop a career path that may best suit their qualities and attributes. Secondly, it may allow the coach to undertake further learning and development in the areas that the selectors perceive the coach does not meet the required standard of merit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elite sports coaching, career pathways, Australian softball</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206303</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROLE OF HABITAT STRUCTURE AND COMPETITION IN THE ECOLOGY OF LISTERIA SPECIES IN FOOD-RELATED AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTS</field><field name="creator">Sally Chiu</field><field name="description">Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen with a high mortality rate in susceptible populations and is of great public health concern with regard to food safety. The ability to grow at refrigeration temperatures during storage and at low pH levels during food processing has enabled the species to establish and sustain growth on processed food. Some food products particularly at risk of contamination by L. monocytogenes are deli or processed meat products, seafood, processed vegetables, dairy products and other food that do not require heating or reheating before consumption. The aims of this study are therefore to investigate firstly the prevalence rates of the species in high risk food products and a food processing plant in Brisbane. Secondly, to determine whether food isolates are better than environmental isolates at surviving the stress factors in food processing environments, or if their lineage groupings are a better indicator of their survival. Thirdly, to compare the survival of food and environmental isolates under temperature stress in co-cultures. A survey of more than 100 high-risk food products at supermarkets was carried out to investigate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes and other Listeria species in food. Isolates were also obtained from a food processing plant during routine tests. This study has found a low prevalence rate (under 10%) of L. monocytogenes in the processed vegetables and meat products tested. Other products tested included processed and raw seafood and processed fresh fruit. More L. monocytogenes isolates were isolated from the food processing plant (101) than from the food survey (25). Listeria grayi (73 isolates), a non-pathogenic species, was more frequently isolated from the food survey. The characterisation of those isolates has revealed their lineage groupings and REP-PCR profiles, which did not appear to be related to their sources. A selected group of 25 isolates were also serotyped for further identification. A larger number of lineage II isolates (70) were found compared to lineage I isolates (25), and were more common in food than the environments; while some (7) produced inconclusive results in the lineage PCR. The REP-PCR did not separate isolates of different sources, lineages or serotypes. In order to investigate the survival fitness of L. monocytogenes isolates whilst under environmental stress relevant to food safety, ten isolates from the food survey and food processing plant were chosen. Five isolates each from lineages I and II were subjected to temperatures ranging from 4&#186;C to 30&#186;C and pH levels from 4.0 to 6.0 for two weeks continuously, with their growth monitored by either optical density or plate counts. It was found that the isolates were most susceptible at the combination of pH 4.0 and 4&#186;C, where the growth of the isolates was completely inhibited. Again no relationship was observed between the lineage or the sources and the survival fitness of the chosen isolates. Due to the frequency of L. monocytogenes being co-isolated with other Listeria species as well as other food-borne pathogens, the relative competitive fitness of four of the isolates from the survival fitness experiment were compared in co-cultures at 4&#186;C and 30&#186;C at pH 7.4 in a small-scale preliminary study. The four isolates from food and environments were grown in broth cultures in pairs with the plate counts performed on antibiotic-supplemented selective TSA agar. The isolates were distinguished on agar supplemented with tetracycline which the isolates had acquired resistance to for this purpose. No significant difference (P&gt;0.05) was observed between the lineages or the sources and the competitive fitness of the isolates in this study. The isolates always produced slightly more colonies in the antibioticresistant form compared to the wildtype form but did not seem to relate to the competitive fitness of the isolates. It would seemed that within the scope of this study, neither the lineage, serotype nor source of the isolates indicated any isolate with a better ability of survival while at low temperatures and low pH levels in pure and mixed cultures. However, other classifying groups such as serotypes, RAPD profiles may reveal possible co-relations, as well as a wider isolate pool. Furthermore, different stress factors could be included as part of an investigation on the survival of L. monocytogenes, as this study focused on food safety during processing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Listeria species</field><field name="subject">Listeria monocytogenes</field><field name="subject">processed meat</field><field name="subject">food survey</field><field name="subject">growth</field><field name="subject">cold temperature</field><field name="subject">low pH</field><field name="subject">mixed cultures</field><field name="subject">tetracycline</field><field name="subject">lineage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206368</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CD4+ T cells provide help to CD8+ T cells in immune recall responses in skin.</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Broom</field><field name="description">Immune responses to antigens presented at skin, or other epithelial surfaces such as the cervix, are important for the clearance of viral infections, such as human papillomavirus (HPV) that infect epithelial cells [13]. Elucidation of the components of an effective immune response to antigens presented in this manner will potentially aid in design of immune modulatory techniques or therapeutic vaccine strategies to treat conditions such as cervical cancer. This thesis addresses the role of CD4+ T lymphocytes in immune responses to antigens presented in skin. CD4+ T cells have a well established role in the priming of CD8+ T cells, such that priming without help results in defective CD8+ T cell memory response [15]. The role of CD4+ T cells in the immune response subsequent to priming is less well delineated [15, 16]. Murine skin grafting is a model of antigen presented at an epithelial surface. The model used in this thesis utilises grafts transgenically expressing neo-antigens (human growth hormone=hGH, ovalbumin=OVA) under the control of a keratin promoter (K14 or K5) in the graft. The corresponding mice are termed K14hGH and K5mOVA. With hGH as the antigen, rejection of such skin grafts were shown to require CD4+ T cells [1]. The most surprising finding was that this requirement for CD4+ T cells was maintained even in an antigen-experienced host (in the recall immune response to hGH). CD4+ T cells are required by graft-primed recipients to reject hGH-expressing grafts, but are not required to reject grafts expressing alternative antigens such as OVA. In an adoptive transfer model into lymphopaenic hosts, when high numbers of CD8+ T cells were transferred, any addition of CD4+ T cells was superfluous. However, with low numbers of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells, the addition of CD4+ T cells resulted in a significantly faster rate of K5mOVA skin graft rejection. This helper enhancement of K5mOVA skin graft rejection is maintained, even 7 when CD8+ T cells were previously activated to a memory phenotype prior to transfer, indicating that CD4+ T cells do have effects after CTL priming in vivo. The requirement for CD4+ T cells in the rejection of C57.K14hGH grafts is abrogated by the addition of a local inflammatory stimulus (TLR7 agonist, imiquimod). This is a local rather than systemic effect, suggesting an influence on trafficking or local effector function. Administration of agonist anti-CD40 antibody also partially abrogates the need for CD4+ T cells in rejection of C57.K14hGH grafts by primed hosts. Although CD40 has a well established role in priming of na&#239;ve CTL responses, our findings indicate that CD40 can alter events after priming, and suggests a possible mechanism for the role of CD4+ T cells in this system. With these data, we speculate that CD4+ T cells may provide help by altering the state of APC cross-presenting antigen to experienced CD8+ T cells, and that this can be substituted by TLR or CD40 mediated activation of APC. The result may be an increased number of effector CD8+ T cells, as we demonstrate that high numbers of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells can abrogate this effect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cd4 T Cells</field><field name="subject">secondary immune response</field><field name="subject">Skin Graft</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206479</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Tyrian purple and its precursors from Australian molluscs.</field><field name="creator">Baker, Joseph Thomas.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Purple.</field><field name="subject">Dyes and dyeing.</field><field name="subject">Mollusks.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215452</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some studies in protein chemistry</field><field name="creator">Augusteyn, Robert Cornelis.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="subject">Proteins.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215522</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generation X and television current affairs: Journalism and youth culture in the 1990s</field><field name="creator">Sternberg, Jason, 1971-</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">Generation X -- Intellectual life.</field><field name="subject">Youth -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="subject">Leisure -- Cross-cultural studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216903</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gendering the podium : the journeys of professional women conductors</field><field name="creator">Bartleet, Brydie-Leigh.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">Women conductors (Music)</field><field name="subject">Women musicians.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216899</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new MOSFET's metallurgical channel length extraction method based on gate-to-substrate capacitance</field><field name="creator">Jiang, C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105618</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fruit fly (diptera.

Halford et al. propose that the relational complexity metric forms an ordinal scale along which both task complexity and an individual&#146;s processing capacity can be ranked. However, the underlying quantitative structure of the RC metric is largely unknown. It is argued that an assessment of the measurement properties of the RC metric is necessary to first demonstrate that the scale is able to rank order task complexity and cognitive capacity in adults. If in addition to ordinal ranking, it can be demonstrated that a continuous monotonic scale underlies the ranking of capacity (the natural extension of the complexity classification), then the potential to improve our understanding of adult cognition is further realised. Using a combination of cognitive psychology and individual differences methodologies, this thesis explores the psychometric properties of RC in three high level reasoning tasks. The Knight-Knave Task and the Sentence Comprehension Task come from the psychological literature. The third task, the Latin Square Task, was developed especially for this project to test the RC theory. An extensive RC analysis of the Knight-Knave Task is conducted using the Method for Analysis of Relational Complexity (MARC). Processing in the Knight-Knave Task has been previously explored using deduction-rules and mental models. We have taken this work as the basis for applying MARC and attempted to model the substantial demands these problems make on limited working memory resources in terms of their relational structure. The RC of the Sentence Comprehension Task has been reported in the literature and we further review and extend the empirically evidence for this task. The primary criterion imposed for developing the Latin Square Task was to minimize confounds that might weaken the identification and interpretation of a RC effect. Factors such as storage load and prior experience were minimized by specifying that the task should be novel, have a small number of general rules that could be mastered quickly by people of differing ages and abilities, and have no rules that are complexity level specific. The strength of MARC lies in using RC to explicitly link the cognitive demand of a task with the capacity of the individual. The cognitive psychology approach predicts performance decrements with increased task complexity and primarily deals with aggregated data across task condition (comparison of means). It is argued however that to minimise the subtle circularity created by validating a task&#146;s complexity using the same information that is used to validate the individual&#146;s processing capacity, an integration of the individual differences approach is necessary. The first major empirical study of the project evaluates the utility of the traditional dual-task approach to analyse the influence of the RC manipulation on the dual-task deficit. The Easy-to-Hard paradigm, a modification of the dual-task methodology, is used to explore the influence of individual differences in processing capacity as a function of RC. The second major empirical study explores the psychometric approach to cognitive complexity. The basic premise is that if RC is a manipulation of cognitive complexity in the traditional psychometric sense, then it should display similar psychometric properties. That is, increasing RC should result in an increasing monotonic relationship between task performance and Fluid Intelligence (Gf) &#150; the complexity-Gf effect. Results from the comparison of means approach indicates that as expected, mean accuracy and response times differed reliably as a function of RC. An interaction between RC and Gf on task performance was also observed. The pattern of correlations was generally not consistent across RC tasks and is qualitatively different in important ways to the complexity-Gf effect. It is concluded that the Latin Square Task has sufficient measurement properties to allows us to discuss (i) how RC differs from complexity in tasks in which expected patterns of correlations are observed, (ii) what additional information needs to be considered to assist with the a priori identification of task characteristics that impose high cognitive demand, and (iii) the implications for understanding reasoning in dynamic and unconstrained environments outside the laboratory. We conclude that relational complexity theory provides a strong foundation from which to explore the influence of individual differences in performance further.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380199 Psychology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">780108 Behavioural and cognitive sciences</field><field name="subject">intelligence</field><field name="subject">relational complexity</field><field name="subject">cogntive complexity</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">processing limitations</field><field name="subject">comprehension</field><field name="subject">cognitive psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157930</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'third way' in action: Inclusion at a cost</field><field name="creator">Begg, Clive</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750504 Law enforcement</field><field name="subject">third way</field><field name="subject">sociology</field><field name="subject">political science</field><field name="subject">Giddens</field><field name="subject">Etzioni</field><field name="subject">third wave</field><field name="subject">political imperative</field><field name="subject">moral imperative</field><field name="subject">civil society</field><field name="subject">partnerships</field><field name="subject">NGOs</field><field name="subject">political activism</field><field name="subject">dissent</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157926</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these

name="creator">Koh, Tieh Koun</field><field name="description">In this study, a strategic thinking and planning model known as Synergy Value Index (SVI) model was developed for estimating the synergy value in MandA. The SVI (QE) from the confirmed SVI model allows quick estimation of synergy between two companies in a merger and acquisition. SVI (QE) is expressed as a percentage, which is a measurement of synergy between two companies in an MandA. This confirmed SVI model evolved from the theoretical model through a process of model building. The study took a holistic approach of understanding synergy value drivers from different schools of thought found in the literatures. A theoretical strategic thinking and planning model was developed and confirmed by expert panelists, from which a conceptual model was created. The conceptual model was tested in two case studies and modified to the preliminary model. The preliminary model was further tested in two case studies to arrive at the confirmed model. During the process of model building, the concepts of synergy value and synergy value drivers become clearer. The study found that 39 synergy value drivers are important in estimating synergy value for MandA. However, only 11 synergy value drivers need be considered for quick computation of Synergy Value Index. In addition, the study offers insight to the study of synergy in MandA. Approaching the study from various different schools of thought was significant because it contributes to a holistic understanding of the behavior of the various synergy value drivers. The study proposed a model identifying synergy value drivers that was confirmed by both expert panelists and case studies. By using the SVI as a unit of measurement of synergy, synergy value drivers of different importance can be measured relative to each other for comparison. The model allowed for a quick evaluation of synergy fit in MandA, especially when the time frame for making a good decision with minimum error during the pre-acquisition phase can be very short. In practice, the SVI model can be used with other financial evaluation tools to provide a strategic perspective of the potential merger and acquisition to the acquirer. Hence, the model can be a very useful platform for the acquirer to think and discuss internally and quantitatively in terms of SVI of the various takeover candidate companies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business and management</field><field name="subject">mergers</field><field name="subject">acquisitions</field><field name="subject">synergy value index</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28281</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28281</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encounter with society : a social justice course for adults in Catholic Parishes in Japan</field><field name="creator">McCartin, Paul</field><field name="description">Thesis (MReligion)--University of South Australia, 2001.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Religion and sociology</field><field name="subject">Baptism</field><field name="subject">Catechetics</field><field name="subject">Social justice</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80001</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43557</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a "first flush" tank for use in Adelaide residential catchments</field><field name="creator">Watson, Steven</field><field name="description">Two catchments were investigated to determine whether the "first flush" effect was likely to occur in metropolitican Adelaide, South Australia.

In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Objective Linear Programming in Radiotherapy Treatment Planning</field><field name="creator">Shao, Lizhen</field><field name="description">The aim of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is to kill tumor cells while at the same time protecting the surrounding tissue and organs from the damaging effect of radiation. To achieve these goals computerized inverse planning systems are used. Given the number of beams and beam directions, beam intensity profiles that yield the best dose distribution under consideration of clinical and physical constraints are calculated. This is called beam intensity optimization problem. In this thesis, we first review existing mathematical models and computation methods for the beam intensity optimization problem. Next, we formulate the beam intensity optimization problem as a multiobjective linear programme (MOLP) with three objectives. For clinical cases this optimization problem involves thousands of variables and tens of thousands of constraints and existing methods such as multiobjective simplex methods can not handle it. The rest of the thesis is dedicated to developing methods to solve this large MOLP efficiently and to the application in the beam intensity optimization problem. Benson (1998c) argues that solving an MOLP in objective space needs less computation time than solving it in decision space if the number of objectives of the MOLP is much smaller than the number of variables. Moreover, the constraint matrix of the problem relies on the calculation of dose deposited in tissue. Since this calculation is always imprecise solving the MOLP exactly is not necessary in practice. This motivates us to develop algorithms for solving an MOLP in objective space approximately. We summarize Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm for solving MOLPs in objective space and propose some small changes to improve computational performance. Then in order to approximate the true nondominated set we propose a modification of Benson&#8217;s algorithm which is called an approximation version of Benson&#8217;s algorithm. Our approximation algorithm computes an inner and an outer approximation of the nondominated set. We prove that the inner approximation provides a set of &#949;-nondominated points. The geometric duality theory of Heyde and L&#168;ohne (2006) defines a dual to an MOLP and it assures us to be able to find the nondominated set of the primal MOLP by solving its dual MOLP. Based on this we develop a dual variant of Benson&#8217;s outer approximation algorithm to solve the dual MOLP in objective space. We prove that solving the dual provides a weight set decomposition. We compare the primal algorithm and the dual algorithm on small illustrative and on radiotherapy examples. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to solve the dual MOLP approximately but within specified tolerance. This approximate solution set can be used to calculate an approximation of the nondominated set of the primal MOLP.We show that this set is an &#949;-nondominated set of the original primal MOLP and provide numerical evidence that this approach can be faster than solving the primal MOLP approximately. Considering that the set of nondominated points is infinite, it is not very useful from the planners&#8217; point of view. We address the problem of finding well distributed nondominated points for an MOLP.We propose a method which combines the global shooting and normal boundary intersection methods. By doing so, we overcome the limitation of normal boundary intersection method that parts of the nondominated set may be missed. Discrepancy analysis of the nondominated points from a geometry point of view shows that this method produces evenly distributed nondominated  points. Moreover, the coverage error and the uniformity level can be measured. Finally, we apply the algorithms developed to the beam intensity optimization problem of 3D clinical cases with voxel size of 5mm and 3mm. A technique of reducing the resolution in normal tissue has been used to reduce the computation time. The results clearly illustrate the advantages of our methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2478</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chemical gradients across porous silicon sensors</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Corrina</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the formation of compositional gradients across 0.5 &#8211; 1 cm of porous silicon layers which had thicknesses of 2 &#8211; 10 &#956;m. These compositional gradients were then characterised, and their potential use as vapour sensors was probed. Surface composition gradients have been reported on flat surfaces, but this is the first time that they have been reported on a three-dimensional material with controlled pore geometry. Chemical gradients have been generated across the surface of porous silicon by performing electrochemical attachment of organohalides with an asymmetric electrode arrangement, and by chemical hydrosilylation of alkenes in the presence of a diffusion gradient of diazonium salts across the porous silicon surface. Samples with electrochemical gradients of methyl, pentyl acetate, and decyl and using chemical hydrosilylation with gradients of undecanoic acid and decyl groups. The latter four gradient-modified porous silicon types have been &#8216;endcapped&#8217; with methyl groups to give improved stability and greater hydrophobicity. The pentyl acetate and undecanoic groups have been converted into pentanol and undecanoate groups respectively to increase the hydrophilicity of these porous silicon surfaces. The gradients have been characterised using two-dimensional FTIR microspectrophotometry and water contact angle measurements. The interaction of these gradient porous silicon samples with ethanol, heptane, toluene and 2-hexanol vapours have been monitored either by UV-Vis reflectance spectroscopy at selected points across the surface or more globally using a digital camera. The undecanoate gradient porous silicon sample showed a large difference in optical response between the undecanoate end and the methyl end of the gradient when exposed to water vapour, showing that imposition of a chemical gradient can alter the sensing character of porous silicon in a controllable manner.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5167</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface properties and finishing of aluminium casting alloys</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Chuong Luu</field><field name="description">Aluminium alloys are materials of huge practical importance. However their use is dependent on surface oxides and hydroxides which are critical in protecting the highly reactive underlying metal. The stability and integrity of the oxides and hydroxides are also crucial in finishing and bonding applications. Better understanding of these surfaces has significant implications in enhancing their application. LM6 and LM25 aluminium-silicon casting alloys were studied as these materials show a particularly inhomogeneous phase structure and complex surface behaviour. This complexity is of fundamental interest and leads to considerable practical difficulties, especially in surface finishing. The surfaces were characterised, subjected to thermal treatments and modified with Ion Assisted Deposition coatings of TiN. A characterisation method for these surfaces was also developed based around the layered structure of aluminium hydroxides. It was observed that the thermally induced surface segregation of minor elements, such as Mg and Na, is availability-limited. Surface concentrations of these elements are determined by the net effect of enriching via surface segregation and depleting through surface evaporation. The inhomogeneous phase structure of the alloys used in this study enables the observation of two migration processes driven by different forces. Below the oxide dominated surface layer, the migration of Mg is driven by chemical potential gradient and is primarily perpendicular to the surface. Closer to the surface, concentration driven horizontal diffusion of the element occurs. The deposition of a thin TiN layer has been used to probe the interface. While the deposition conditions of TiN coatings affect the chemistry of the coatings, substrate surface conditions determine how well bonding is achieved between the film and substrate. The height difference between silicon particles in the eutectic phase and the primary aluminium phase of the casting alloys provides surface roughening and optimal adhesion through mechanical interlocking with the coating. This height difference is achieved by preferentially removing the surface exposed primary aluminium phases with ion bombardment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5633</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intracellular trafficking of cannabinoid receptor 1: a thorough characterisation and investigation into the role of the intracellular pool</field><field name="creator">Grimsey, Natasha Lillia</field><field name="description">Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1), an abundant G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) in the central nervous system, is currently of significant interest as a therapeutic target. The cellular control of receptor trafficking is intimately linked with drug effects, however in comparison with other GPCRs, the study of CB1 trafficking is in its infancy. Although the existing literature suggests CB1 should be classified as a &#8220;dual-fate&#8221; receptor, some conflicting evidence exists as to the conditions under which CB1 recycles or degrades. Of particular interest is the widely noted intracellular pool which has been speculated to form part of a constitutive internalisation and recycling pathway. This study performs a detailed quantification of CB1 trafficking in four cell lines, one of which expresses CB1 endogenously. A novel high-throughput immunocytochemistry-based approach is applied to quantitatively measure receptor trafficking. An important advance on previous studies is the use of a proteolytic method to directly quantitate intracellular receptors. Contrary to previous reports, the data suggests that CB1 does not recycle following constitutive or agonist-induced internalisation but instead exhibits a primarily degradative phenotype. Evidence is obtained through antibody &#8220;live-feeding&#8221; protocols and the effects of protein synthesis inhibitors, among other approaches. In addition, the data suggests that the intracellular pool does not traffic to the cell surface and therefore does not contribute to CB1 signalling via classical paradigms. The effects of Rab GTPase dominantly-acting positive and negative mutants on basal CB1 localisation corroborate these results. The findings of this thesis have significant implications for the interpretation of CB1 biochemical studies and call for a revision of the currently held theories of CB1 intracellular trafficking. The study provides a foundation for further mechanistic studies and may impact the design and application of cannabinoid therapeutics.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5888</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative and qualitative study of lifestyle and obesity in Asian adolescents in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Foroughian, Shirin</field><field name="description">Overweight and obesity in childhood is a major and growing public health concern with short and long term physical and psychological consequences. Historically obesity was seen as a non-Asian phenomenon, hence this research focused on looking at issues of overweight and obesity in twelve to eighteen year old Asians in New Zealand. Particular emphasis was given to investigating the nutritional and exercise behaviours of young New Zealand Asians, in order to suggest a health promotion approach to empower and improve the health of young people. The research was based on both quantitative (structured individual interviews and anthropometry measurements with 821 students) and qualitative approaches (semistructured interviews with 12 focus groups comprising 46 students) of South Asian, East Asian and European ethnicity who lived and attended high schools in South Auckland. The findings suggest that being overweight is a concern faced by Asian adolescents at the same level as European adolescents. The results show no significant difference in mean body mass index or mean waist to height ratio amongst the three ethnic groups; and no difference in fat mass between South Asian and European adolescents when using same cut-off points for all ethnicities. Additionally, there are a number of other risk factors affecting the weight status of Asian adolescents including: missing breakfast or lunch; consumption of junk food such as chips, biscuits, chocolates and pies while at school or at home before dinner; purchasing food from school canteens or dairies; discrimination of traditional foods at school; high consumption of sugary drinks, fried and fast foods; having access to more food and more variety than in their traditional cultures; lack of exercise and opportunities to be active; and hours spent watching television or playing computer or electronic games. There are also a number of factors that play a protective role for all adolescents in maintaining a healthy weight including: having breakfast and lunch; bringing food from home; walking to school; and doing sports at school or being involved in an organised or team sport. Empowering and culturally appropriate &#8216;educational and physical activity interventions&#8217; for young people and their families are recommended; but to deal with the issue of obesity in Asian adolescents, family, school, community and government all have to play a role.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5891</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Caregiver support following the disclosure of child sexual abuse</field><field name="creator">van Toledo, Annik</field><field name="description">Children who have been sexually abused generally have better outcomes if they receive support from their caregivers. However, in the literature to date there has been little focus on the needs of the caregivers supporting their child and the ways these can be addressed. In New Zealand, the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) introduced a pilot programme in 2006 that aimed to support caregivers in their parenting following the disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA) by providing education about CSA, assisting in management of their children, and teaching them coping skills. This thesis presents the findings of a programme evaluation carried out on the Parenting Support Pilot Programme implemented by ACC. This evaluation is the first large-scale study that has investigated an individual caregiver intervention that provides more than just psychoeducation. The programme was evaluated using an action research framework that included a needs assessment, process evaluation, outcome evaluation, and feedback given to ACC both during and at the completion of the pilot. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used, with an emphasis on interview data from consumers of the programme. The needs assessment was conducted on 60 paper files supplied by ACC and confirmed that support for caregivers is indicated following the disclosure of CSA. The process evaluation consisted of face-to-face semi-structured interviews with two ACC managers, two ACC peer reviewers, 11 ACC counsellors, and 10 caregivers. This evaluation produced recommendations to improve awareness and access to the programme, and identified the need for more sessions than prescribed for some caregivers. Despite some ongoing programme delivery issues, the impact evaluation, conducted via 57 telephone interviews with caregivers, showed that the programme was beneficial for most caregivers and their children. Specifically, the programme increased caregivers&#8217; understanding of the impact of CSA on their child, improved caregivers&#8217; ability to help their children, and helped them manage their own responses to the sexual abuse disclosure.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5894</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of biotransformation in the antitumour activity and toxicology of the hypoxia-activated pre-prodrug PR-104</field><field name="creator">Gu, Yongchuan</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is a characteristic of tumours and an attractive therapeutic target. PR-104, a  hypoxia-activated prodrug in clinical trial, is a phosphate ester which is rapidly  converted to the alcohol PR-104A, and then activated by reduction to hydroxylamine  (PR-104H) and amine (PR-104M) metabolites selectively in hypoxic cells. This thesis  explores the pharmacology of PR-104. The primary objectives were to define  relationships between metabolic transformation of PR-104, its toxicity to normal  tissues, its clearance from the body, and its antitumour activity in preclinical models.  DNA damage responsible for cytotoxicity of PR-104A was characterised by comparing  sensitivity of repair-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with their repair-competent  counterparts. The activated metabolites PR-104H and PR-104M showed a  repair profile similar to typical DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, including  dependence on the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease (implicated in unhooking DNA  interstrand crosslinks at blocked replication forks) and Rad51D (required for  homologous recombination repair). PR-104A cytotoxicity under hypoxia is accounted  for by DNA crosslinking by these reduced metabolites. This study showed that hypoxia, reductase activity, and DNA interstrand crosslink repair proficiency are key  variables that interact to determine PR-104A sensitivity.  PR-104 was rapidly excreted in mice, with approximately equal excretion in urine and  faeces. Investigation of pathways of biotransformation in mice, rats, dogs and humans  identified major species difference in biotransformation of PR-104 in that N-dealkylation  and subsequent metabolites from the mercapturic acid pathway was major  in rodents, while O-glucuronidation of PR-104A much more extensive in dogs and  humans. The nitroreduction pathway was found in all species, with different patterns in  that PR-104M was prominent in rodents but PR-104H was higher in humans. Overall,  the results suggest that rodents may not be appropriate for modelling human  biotransformation and toxicology of PR-104.  A rapid and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for quantitation of the  major metabolites of PR-104 in humans. Application to plasma samples from phase I  clinical trials demonstrated approximately dose-linear pharmacokinetics but high variability between individuals in concentrations of the glucuronide. The species and  individual difference in glucuronidation were further examined using a microsomal  metabolism model. Glucuronidation was fastest in dog liver microsomes, followed by  human then rodent microsomes. UGT2B7 appeared to be the only human isoform able  to conjugate PR-104A, which was further confirmed by a strong correlation between  UGT2B7 protein content and glucuronidation activity in microsomes from different  individuals. The results suggest that differences in UGT2B7 activity may contribute to  individual differences in PR-104A pharmacokinetics, and that the role of this enzyme in  the toxicology of PR-104 warrants further investigation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5907</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-pressure-induced starch gelatinisation and its application in a dairy system : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Doctor of Philosophy in Food Science at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Oh, Hyunah Eustina</field><field name="description">This study investigated pressure-induced starch gelatinisation in water and milk suspensions. A rheological method, termed &#8216;pasting curves&#8217;, provided an objective and analytical means to determine the degree of pressure-induced starch gelatinisation. In addition, a polarised light microscope was used to observe birefringence of the starch granules and the degree of starch swelling was measured. The preliminary investigation into pressure-induced gelatinisation of six different starches showed that potato starch was the most pressure resistant and was not gelatinised after a pressure treatment of 600 MPa for 30 min at 20 &#176;C. Waxy rice, waxy corn and tapioca starches showed complete gelatinisation after the same treatment while normal rice and normal corn starches were only partially gelatinised despite the disappearance of birefringence. Based on the preliminary study, two starches (normal and waxy rice starches) were selected for more detailed studies. The effects of treatment conditions (pressure, temperature and duration) on the gelatinisation were investigated with these selected starches. The degree of gelatinisation was dependent on the type of starch and the treatment conditions. The results also indicated that different combinations of the treatment conditions (e.g. high treatment pressure for a short time and low treatment pressure for a longer time) could result in the same degree of gelatinisation. Both starch types exhibited sigmoidal-shaped pressure-induced gelatinisation curves and there was a linear correlation between the degree of swelling and the apparent viscosity of the starch suspension. After treatments at =500 MPa for 30 min at 20 &#176;C, both starches lost all birefringence although the apparent viscosity and the degree of swelling of normal rice starch did not increase to the same extent as observed in waxy rice starch. Pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch was retarded when starch was suspended in skim milk. This was attributed to the effect of soluble milk minerals and lactose present in the milk whereas milk proteins (casein and whey) did not affect the degree of gelatinisation at the levels present in 10% total solids skim milk. The presence of soluble milk and/or lactose may lead to less effective plasticising of starch chains by the suspension medium. Interactions between milk components and starch molecules may also play a role in retarding gelatinisation by reducing the mobility of starch chains. The functionality of starch in a dairy application was tested using acid milk gels as a model system. Skim milk with added starch (waxy rice or potato starch) was either pressure treated (500 MPa, 20&#176;C, 30 min) or heat treated (80&#176;C, 30 min) and subsequently acidified to form acid milk gels. The addition of waxy rice starch resulted in firmer acid milk gels, and increasing the amount of starch caused an increase in the firmness of both pressure-treated and heat-treated samples. However, pressure-treated samples with added potato starch did not show significant changes in the firmness whereas the heat-treated counterparts showed a marked increase in the firmness as the level of potato starch increased. The difference between the effects of the two different starches can be explained by the extent of starch gelatinisation in skim milk. Starch granules absorb water during gelatinisation whether induced by pressure or heat which effectively increases milk protein concentration in the aqueous phase to form a denser protein gel network on acidification. The firmness of acid milk gels can be increased by adjusting the pH at pressure or heat treatment to higher than the natural pH of milk. The effect of pH at pressure or heat treatment and addition of starch on the acid milk gel firmness was additive and independent of each other up to a starch addition level of 1%. This study provided an insight into pressure-induced gelatinisation of starch by showing gelatinisation properties of starches of different botanical origins and the effects of the treatment conditions (treatment pressure, treatment temperature and duration) on the degree of gelatinisation. Furthermore, the results from the pressure treatments of starch in dairy-based suspensions showed that pressure-induced gelatinisation was affected by other components in the system. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding the gelatinisation properties of starch in complicated food systems in which a number of other components are present. In terms of the application of starch in dairy systems, when starch was added to milk and gelatinised by pressure treatment, the acid milk gel produced by subsequent acidification was firmer than the acid milk gel made from skim milk alone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">birefringence</field><field name="subject">skim milk</field><field name="subject">rice starch</field><field name="subject">potato starch</field><field name="subject">acid milk gel</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1075</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing general motor ability and tests for talent identification of Malaysian adoloescents</field><field name="creator">Ibrahim, Halijah</field><field name="description">[Truncated astract] Talent Identification (TI) in sports begins by mass screening individuals' motor abilities. du Randt (2000) wrote that, as test items from one country might not necessarily suit another, appropriate basic motor skill test items are important for developing a TI mass screening instrument. Three hundred and thirty Malaysian adolescents aged from 12-15 years were tested on three motor skill test batteries: the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND, McCarron, 1982); the Australian Talent Identification Test (AIS, Australian Sports Commission, 1998); and a Balance and Movement Coordination Test which was specifically developed for this project. In the current research, the motor performance data recorded from the adolescents underwent several types of analyses. Principal Component analyses were conducted on the MAND, AIS and BMC motor skill instruments to understand what the three motor skill instruments were assessing globally in the Malaysian adolescents. Then, first-order and higher-order factor analyses were conducted on the 13 parameters making up the AIS+BMC motor skill instrument to examine the concept of general motor ability (GMA). After descriptive analyses of the adolescents' motor skill performances, age and gender differences were examined using two (gender) by four (age) ANOVAs. Finally, stepwise discriminant function analyses were conducted on a combined AIS+BMC motor skill instrument to determine the best sub-set of motor skills that reliably classified the Malaysian adolescents into three levels of motor performance.... Two stepwise discriminant analyses were undertaken to find the best set of motor skills for classifying Malaysian adolescents into three motor coordination groups based on scores on the MAND and three motor ability groups derived from scores on the motoric 'g'. The ability of a combined AIS+BMC motor skill instrument to classify Malaysian adolescents into the three groups was good for those classified as Normal, not so great for those adolescents classified as High, and poor for those adolescents classified as Low. The motor skills consistently reported across both sets of analyses were Balance-Eyes-Open, Balance-Eyes-Closed, Dynamic Balance, Hopping Speed, Quadrant Jump, Hopping-in-Square, Basketball Throw and Shuttle-Run-with-Object. Hence, motor skills assessing static balance, dynamic balance and postural control appeared to reliably discriminate the Malaysian adolescents into three motor performance groups. Finally, an examination of the misclassifications found in the discriminant analyses revealed two things. Those individuals being predicted into a lower group performed a large number of the motor skills to a lesser standard when compared with their correctly classified cohorts. Conversely, those predicted into a higher group performed a number of motor skills to a standard higher than their correctly classified cohorts. Thus, at a global level, certain individuals could be overlooked for further athletic development and is a concern when developing a rigorous TI program. Therefore, practitioners need to be cautious of any single ability score, and how that represents an individual's athletic potential. These results are discussed, limitations noted, and directions for future research provided.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motor ability -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Motor ability -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Teenagers -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Sports -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Athletic ability -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Talent identification</field><field name="subject">Motor skill testing</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0109</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and characterization of novel secreted factors involved in bone remodeling</field><field name="creator">Chim, Shek Man</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Bone remodeling is an important process to maintain mechanical integrity. It is accomplished by two important steps, bone resorption followed by new bone formation. Osteoclasts and osteoblasts are the principal cells in bone resorption and bone formation, respectively. A multitude of local and systemic factors regulates this process by controlling the cellular activities in bone remodeling compartments (BRC). An imbalance of osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic bone destruction will result in the development of skeletal diseases. Recent studies suggested that angiogenesis is closely associated with bone remodeling. The vasculature in bone is important for skeletal development, growth and repair. During endochondral ossification, cartilage is invaded by blood vessels which bring in osteoblast and osteoclast precursor cells, nutrients, growth factors and differentiation factors. During fracture repair, it has been demonstrated that mature osteoclasts produce heparanase which can degrade heparin sulfate proteoglycans, a major component in extracellular matrix (ECM). The process leads to the release of heparin-binding growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor which contributes largely to local angiogenesis. In recent studies, endothelial cells have been found to produce bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and BMP-4 when they are subjected to mechanical stimuli, or a hypoxia environment. Conversely, inhibition of angiogenesis has been shown to prevent fracture healing. In a distraction osteogenesis model, either inhibition of angiogenesis or disruption of the mechanical environment prevents normal osteogenesis and results in fibrous nonunion. .... A total of 42 mice from F1 and F2 generations were genotyped as transgene positive. Preliminary analysis using radiography did not reveal any difference between the gross structures of transgenic and wild type mice. Interestingly, the preliminary histology revealed a decrease in trabecular bone and an increase of lipid space in metaphysis of transgenic mice overexpressing EGFL6. However, further studies will need to be carried out to investigate the role of EGFL6 in angiogenesis and adipogenesis using a transgenic mice model. This will be a prime focus of future work. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis have identified EGFL6, a member of the EGF-like family, as a potential angiogenic factor which may play an important role in bone remodeling. EGFL6 has been found to be expressed highly in calvarial osteoblasts and upregulated during primary murine osteoblast differentiation. EGFL6 has been 8 characterized to be a secreted homomeric complex. More importantly, EGFL6 has been shown to induce angiogenic activity in endothelial cell migration, tube formation and in vivo chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. Furthermore, conditioned medium containing the EGFL6 recombinant protein was shown to induce phosphorylation of ERK in endothelial cells. Inhibition of ERK impaired EGFL6-induced ERK activation and endothelial cell migration. Taken together these studies raise the possibility that EGFL6 has a potential role in angiogenesis, and mediates a paracrine mechanism of cross-talk between vascular endothelial cells and osteoblasts during osteogenesis. An understanding of this process offers the potential to facilitate the development of therapeutic treatments for bone disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bone remodeling</field><field name="subject">Neovascularization</field><field name="subject">Epidermal growth factor</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Blood-vessels -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Bone resorption</field><field name="subject">Vascular endothelial growth factors</field><field name="subject">Bones -- Growth</field><field name="subject">Bone remodelling</field><field name="subject">EGF</field><field name="subject">Angiogenesis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0110</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising and improving a magnetic gradiometer for geophysical exploration</field><field name="creator">Sunderland, Andrew</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Magnetic gradiometers are powerful tools for mineral exploration. The magnetic field contains valuable information about the mineral content of the surveyed terrain. The magnetic gradient specifies the amount of spatial variation in the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field. Surveys that measure the magnetic gradient provide vastly more information about geological targets than the magnetic field alone. This technology could have enormous benefits in terms of new discoveries and lower exploration costs. The magnetic gradient is normally calculated by subtracting the outputs of two total field magnetometers which are separated by a baseline. In 1997, a direct string magnetic gradiometer (DSMG) was developed that directly measures magnetic gradients using only a single string as its sensing element. This thesis describes research conducted to improve the sensitivity and performance of the DSMG. The main advantage of the DSMG is that only gradients can induce second harmonic vibrations in the string. Thus, the DSMG is insensitive to uniform magnetic fields that we are not interested in, such as the global magnetic field of the Earth. By using inductive electronics to measure second harmonic string vibrations, we can select to measure the magnetic gradient of nearby targets. Recent work has shown that a magnetic gradiometer with a noise floor of 0.01 nT/m/ v Hz should be sufficiently sensitive for geophysical exploration. In order to reach this goal, this thesis presents an investigation of all noise sources affecting the DSMG. ...  Gas damping is negligible in high vacuum and no vibration isolation is required. This means that longer strings with low resonant frequencies can be used. Using theoretical modelling, I show that a space borne DSMG should be able to match the white noise level of SQuID based magnetic gradiometers and have a lower 1/f noise corner. Deployment in space could be the most viable application of the DSMG because of the ease of operation and enhancement of sensitivity. If the thermal noise level is reduced then other sources of noise will start to become more important. When rotated in the Earth's magnetic field, the DSMG detects a pseudo magnetic gradient despite the field being almost uniform. A possible cause is magnetically susceptible parts which are magnetically aligning with the Earth's field. I have conducted a thorough investigation of magnetic susceptible parts in the DSMG and reported the results in this thesis. In the DSMG, a pair of inductive pickup coils are used to measure the string's displacement with a root mean square accuracy of 1011 m/ v Hz. This is adequate at present but the inductive electronics may not be sensitive enough after other improvements in the DSMG are implemented. Here, I present a new capacitive displacement readout with a high sensitivity of 1013 m/ v Hz. The thesis also presents some magnetic gradient measurements in the lab and the results of a ground survey in the field. These trial measurements are used to characterise the DSMG and demonstrate its effectiveness for airborne surveying.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetometer</field><field name="subject">Aeromagnetic prospecting</field><field name="subject">Minerals -- Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Prospecting -- Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Magnetic gradient</field><field name="subject">Gradiometer</field><field name="subject">String</field><field name="subject">Magnetometer</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0111</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A porosity-based model for coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical processes</field><field name="creator">Liu, Jianxin</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Rocks, as the host to natural chains of coupled thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes, are heterogeneous at a variety of length scales, and in their mechanical properties, as well as in the hydraulic and thermal transport properties. Rock heterogeneity affects the ultimate hydro-carbon recovery or geothermal energy production. This heterogeneity has been considered one important and difficult problem that needs to be taken into account for its effect on the coupled processes. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of rock heterogeneity on multi-physical processes. A fully coupled finite element model, hereinafter referred to as a porosity-based model (PBM) was developed to characterise the thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) coupling processes. The development of the PBM consists of a two-staged workflow. First, based on poromechanics, porosity, one of the inherent rock properties, was derived as a variant function of the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical effects. Then, empirical relations or experimental results, correlating porosity with the mechanical, hydraulic and thermal properties, were incorporated as the coupling effects. In the PBM, the bulk volume of the model is assumed to be changeable. The rate of the volumetric strain was derived as the difference of two parts: the first part is the change in volume per unit of volume and per unit of time (this part was traditionally considered the rate of volumetric strain); and the second is the product of the first part and the volumetric strain. The second part makes the PBM a significant advancement of the models reported in the literature. ... impact of the rock heterogeneity on the hydro-mechanical responses because of the requirement of large memory and long central processing unit (CPU) time for the 3D applications. In the 2D PBM applications, as the thermal boundary condition applied to the rock samples containing some fractures, the pore pressure is generated by the thermal gradient. Some pore pressure islands can be generated as the statistical model and the digital image model are applied to characterise the initial porosity distribution. However, by using the homogeneous model, this phenomenon cannot be produced. In the 3D PBM applications, the existing fractures become the preferential paths for the fluid flowing inside the numerical model. The numerical results show that the PBM is sufficiently reliable to account for the rock mineral distribution in the hydro-mechanical coupling processes. The applications of the statistical method and the digital image processing technique make it possible to visualise the rock heterogeneity effect on the pore pressure distribution and the heat dissipation inside the rock model. Monitoring the fluid flux demonstrates the impact of the rock heterogeneity on the fluid product, which concerns petroleum engineering. The overall fluid flux (OFF) is mostly overestimated when the rock and fluid properties are assumed to be homogeneous. The 3D PBM application is an example. As the rock is heterogeneous, the OFF by the digital core is almost the same as that by the homogeneous model (this is due to that some fractures running through the digital core become the preferential path for the fluid flow), and around 1.5 times of that by the statistical model.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porosity</field><field name="subject">Coupled problems (Complex systems)</field><field name="subject">Rocks -- Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics</field><field name="subject">Weibull distribution</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Porosity-based model</field><field name="subject">THM coupling effect</field><field name="subject">Rock heterogeneity</field><field name="subject">Poromechanics</field><field name="subject">Weibull distribution</field><field name="subject">X-ray CT images</field><field name="subject">2D and 3D application</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0113</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and forecasting cultural and environmental changes</field><field name="creator">Sinay, Laura</field><field name="description">Much of the discourse on cultural change has been descriptive and explanatory, with few attempts to be predictive. Where indicators of and buffers to change are identified, they tend only to be post-event assessable. The need for a tool with strong predictive power is fundamental to cultural (and environmental) impact assessment and the rationale behind this developmental work. Focusing on traditional cultures and their environmental context, and based on a case study of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, Brasil, this research advances knowledge on modelling cultural and environmental changes, and how to manage these changes for accepted goals. A heuristic tool is presented for assessing the impacts of pressures on a culture and its related environment as well as the efficacy of management responses. This tool is associated with methods to assist in developing predictive models representing the change processes. The change model building process involves consulting stakeholders as a way of integrating different perceptions, to identify pressures, responses and links associated with cultural and environmental change. This assists in creating a co-learning environment, which facilitates communication between stakeholders. The change modelling approach permits incorporation of the complexity and uncertainty of the system represented, and enables scenario analyses. These allow expected local and flow-on impacts of management interventions to be tested. This approach is more efficient than stand-alone performance indicators that do not allow for the synergic impacts of management interventions to be observed and assessed. Using the models representing the cultural and environmental change processes of the Cai&#231;aras of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, this research identifies that tourism is a major pressure for change (at that locality). This study also identified that tourist numbers at new and small tourism destinations, as well as on a continental scale, can be forecast using exponential and polynomial functions. Yet, tourism flow may be perturbed at any given time by, for example, acts of violence and when the type of marketing changes. In addition, tourist numbers cannot be greater than the total population, therefore it cannot grow indefinitely as exponential and polynomial functions suggest. Hence, the use of exponential and polynomial functions to forecast tourist numbers is more reliable for short periods, such as four or five years, and when based on six or more sets of data points. The greatest contribution of this research to the cultural change discourse is its innovative approach to study, forecast and manage cultural and environmental changes. The continuation of this research may lead to identifying general theories relating pressures and responses to indicators of cultural and environmental changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">cultural changes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131277</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models and frameworks that enhance systematic planning for coral reef biodiversity conservation</field><field name="creator">Beger, Maria</field><field name="description">The global decline of coral reef biodiversity requires rapid, efficient and practical solutions. No-take marine reserves and reserve systems and other managed marine conservation areas are currently considered one of the most effective management methods to deal with this ongoing decline. Although the effects, design, and establishment of coral reef reserves have been widely debated in the literature, few examples of systematic approaches to the design of reserve systems exist. Systematic conservation planning is a procedure to prioritise sites for their inclusion in reserve systems based on data and a set of conservation principles. For coral reefs the systematic design of reserve systems has been hampered by the lack of spatially explicit data, and the lack of practical recommendations to resource managers of how to apply new scientific findings. This thesis fills critical gaps at the interface between theory, planning, and implementation of coral reef reserve systems, and provides practical guidance to reef managers. In the first chapter, literature on marine reserves is discussed and the implications for coral reef reserves are considered. Chapter 2 discusses the lessons learned in the design and implementation of a community-based marine reserve in the Philippines. Reviewing relevant literature, a framework of &#8216;lessons learnt&#8217; during the establishment of local protected areas is presented, highlighting the importance of a number of factors that are vital to the success of these reserves: (a) an island location; (b) small community population size; (c) minimal effect of land-based development; (d) application of a bottom-up approach; (e) an external facilitating institution; (f) acquisition of title; (g) use of a scientific information database; (h) stakeholder involvement; (i) the establishment of legislation; (j) community empowerment; (k) alternative livelihood schemes; (l) surveillance; (m) tangible management results; (n) continued involvement of external groups after reserve establishment, and (o) small-scale project expansion. To manage coral reef species it is important to understand the processes that influence their distribution. Chapter 3 identifies the environmental factors most influential in determining coral reef fish species distributions on a regional scale. Logistic regression models for 227 fish species related presence-absence data to four remotely determined environmental predictor variables: depth 500 m away from a reef, presence of a land-sea interface, exposure, and the distance to the nearest estuary. A novel method of evaluating model significance identified suitable models for 134 species. All four predictor variables were important for the distributions of the chosen suite of fishes. Depth was the most frequently significant variable in single variable models, and the proximity of a reef to an island was the least frequently important variable. For combinations of two predictor variables, depth and exposure as well as depth and distance from the nearest estuary were the prevalent predictors of fish distributions. Several fish species responded to the combination of the distance from an estuary and the presence of the terrestrial-marine interface, indicating that these species depend on intact coastal reef habitat, which is in decline near the main sediment-laden rivers. Significant models were predominantly developed for habitat specific species. These habitat specific species are of greater conservation concern than widespread species because of their restricted range, or because threats affect them more severely if they are selectively affecting their habitat. For this reason, species distribution modelling may be an efficient method to inform reserve design. The relevance of cross-taxon congruence to the suitability of taxa as conservation representation surrogates of coral reef biodiversity across the Indo-Pacific is tested in Chapter 4, using species lists of fishes, corals, and molluscs. Congruence is identified with a linear regression analysis of dissimilarity values. The utility of a surrogate was determined by the degree to which each taxon can represent the others in a marine reserve network using a greedy reserve selection algorithm. None of the taxonomic groups examined was capable of acting as a general conservation representation surrogate. Even a data-rich taxon like fishes could be severely under-represented in reserve systems designed based on a surrogate taxon such as corals, implying that data-deficient taxa are unlikely to be represented adequately where surrogate taxa are used for planning. Despite the high cross-taxon congruence between fishes and corals, and between corals and molluscs for some regions, cross-taxon congruence was not always a reliable indicator of conservation representation surrogacy. Consequently, in Indo-Pacific coral reef ecosystems one can only be sure that a target taxon is represented fully in a marine reserve network when data on this taxon are used to select reserve sites. The fifth chapter provides a theoretical and practical framework for incorporating ecological processes that span terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environmental realms into systematic conservation planning. Firstly the types of processes are classified as interactions that exist: a) on narrow interfaces such as inter-tidal zones; b) on broad interfaces such as mangrove swamps; c) along constrained connections such as corridors used by amphibian movements between natal ponds and adult habitat; and d) through diffuse connections like bird migrations. A framework of conservation planning approaches to promote the persistence of these types of processes and examples of how they might be implemented is developed. The framework focuses both on problem formulations consistent with existing decision support tools, such as the conservation planning software MARXAN, and on new methods. The review is aimed at a broad audience of scientists, planners, and managers and takes a practical and illustrative approach, providing examples of existing work and pointing readers to tools that are available to enhance conservation planning across realms. In the concluding chapter ideas from all chapters are synthesised. This chapter discusses how the approaches and frameworks presented here could be extended, and profitable areas for future research are suggested. Overall this thesis provides new insights, concepts, and tools that can assist reef managers and scientists struggling to minimise the loss of coral reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:132162</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of bud outgrowth in sugarcane</field><field name="creator">Karno</field><field name="description">Bud outgrowth plays a major role in plant productivity. In sugarcane, where yield is determined by tillering, bud outgrowth becomes critically important. The regulation of bud outgrowth has been studied intensively using branching mutants in many plants, particularly in pea and Arabidopsis. Models illustrating the nature and control of bud outgrowth have been developed accordingly. In sugarcane, in contrast, branching mutants are not yet available and studies on the regulation of bud outgrowth are limited. This thesis evaluates the agronomic importance and possible controls of bud outgrowth in sugarcane. A limited number of Australian commercial varieties for selection of high and low tillering varieties and two segregating populations were used to provide genetic variation in sugarcane. Sugarcane genotypes that show different degrees of tillering were identified. Shoot architecture components such as stalk diameter, length and weight, as well as sucrose content were analysed in the context of tillering among these genotypes (Chapter 2). Eleven sugarcane varieties with different purported tillering behaviours were collected from different regions in Queensland and grown and evaluated under varying conditions. The results showed that tillering, as expected, is modulated by both genetic and environmental factors. Tiller number was found to negatively correlate with stalk diameter and stalk weight, but had little relationship to stalk length and sucrose content. Also, early tiller numbers were found to correlate with millable stalk numbers at harvest. High (Q207A) and low (Q127) tillering varieties were utilized for further studies. More detailed analyses of the relationships between stalk traits and sugar content were performed using two segregating populations (Chapter 3) grown in two consecutive years. Siblings in each population showed large variation in tillering capability. These siblings were also used to test if sugarcane yield can be optimized by altering plant architecture traits. Several important points are highlighted in this work. Firstly, sugar content was not affected by millable stalk number at harvest. Therefore, the modification of stalk number to an optimal number could increase cane yield without adverse effects on commercial cane sugar (CCS), thus increasing sugar production. Secondly, increasing stalk diameter could increase cane yield, but may also decrease CCS. Thirdly, because stalk length is positively correlated with CCS, increasing stalk length could increase both cane yield and CCS. Under the given experimental conditions, optimum yield could be achieved by arranging a millable stalk number of approximately 20 stalks m-1. Environmental conditions greatly affect sugarcane production. The effects of temperature, photoperiod and light intensity on tillering in sugarcane were investigated and presented in Chapter 4. The results demonstrated that bud outgrowth and tillering in sugarcane were indeed modified by environmental factors. Sugarcane grown at lower temperature required less thermal time to produce a tiller, so that tillering was increased at colder temperatures (23/18oC day/night), although the plants produced less dry mass under these conditions. Vigorous plants growing at high temperatures (33/28oC) had reduced tillering and plants grown under extended photoperiods (16 h and 24 h) produced more biomass, however, tiller production was inhibited by a 24 h photoperiod. Decreasing light intensity decreased both biomass production and tiller production. Environmental factors did not mask genetic effects as in most cases, the high tillering variety consistently produced more tillers than moderate and low tillering varieties, except under low light intensity, where all varieties did not tiller. Optimum growth conditions were achieved at 28/23oC, under full light, during a 16 h photoperiod. The regulation of bud outgrowth in sugarcane was investigated by monitoring the expression of several branching genes (SoMAX2, SoMAX3, SoMAX4-1, SoMAX4-2 and SoTB1) in selected high and low tillering varieties (Chapter 5). Decapitation and low light intensity were applied to alter bud outgrowth. The results demonstrate that SoMAX4-1 is an auxin regulated gene in sugarcane. As for the homologous gene in pea, SoMAX4-1 exhibits depleted expression following decapitation, which is restored to intact levels by exogenous auxin application to the decapitated stump. However, SoMAX4-2, which is homologous to SoMAX4-1, was not responsive to auxin, suggesting that SoMAX4-2 may have other functions. It is proposed that SoMAX4-1 and SoMAX3 work cooperatively to control branching, but through different mechanisms: SoMAX4 is regulated by auxin while SoMAX3 acts independently of auxin, but is sensitive to light intensity. Expression of SoTB1, acting inside the axillary buds, also increased under low light. The results suggest that regulatory mechanisms similar to those controlling bud outgrowth in pea and Arabidopsis also exist in sugarcane. Manipulation of the expression of these genes provides a new strategy to regulate bud outgrowth that may be used in crop improvement in sugarcane.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135076</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microbial ecology of equine laminitis of alimentary origin</field><field name="creator">Milinovich, Gabriel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equine, laminitis, hindgut, microbiology, microbial ecology, Streptococcus, oligofructose.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159339</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and Biology of benedeniine capsalid monogeneans</field><field name="creator">Deveney, Marty R.</field><field name="description">Abstract The Benedeniinae, the largest of nine capsalid subfamilies, includes genera with an aseptate, apapillate haptor and a pair of discrete testes.

Tareenia Hussey, 1986 is synonymised with Benedenia because characters used to differentiate the two genera do not indicate discontinuities at the generic level. Benedeniella Johnston, 1929, Calicobenedenia Kritsky and Fennessy, 1999 and Trimusculotrema Whittington and Barton, 1990 are considered to belong in Entobdellinae Bychowsky, 1957, pending further studies on that group. The anatomy of Calicobenedenia is outlined briefly; the other genera are not discussed here in detail. Lachishia n. g. is described, based on the structure of the male copulatory organ and a species is transferred to it from Dioncopseudobenedenia. I describe four new species of benedeniines from teleosts caught at Heron and Green Islands, Australia namely: Benedenia ernsti n. sp. from the gills of Symphorus nematophorus; Benedenia fieldsi n. sp. from the fins of Cephalopholis boenak, C. cyanostigma and C. miniatus; Benedenia haywardi n. sp. from the skin of S. nematophorus and Dioncopsudobenedenia ancoralis n. sp. from the gills of Siganus lineatus. Benedenia akaisaki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. ovata (Goto, 1894) Johnston, 1929, B. kintoki Iwata, 1990 is synonymised with B. elongata (Yamaguti, 1968) Egorova, 1997, B. sargocentron Zhang, Yang and Liu, 2001 is synonymised with B. hawaiiensis Yamaguti, 1968 and Pseudallobenedenia arabica Timofeeva, 1995 is synonymised with P. opakapaka Yamaguti, 1966. Benedenia madai Ishii and Sawada, 1938, B. pagrosomi Ishii and Sawada, 1938 and Allobenedenia pedunculata Raju and Rao, 1980 are considered species inquirendae. I examined an outbreak in aquaculture of the pathogenic benedeniine, Neobenedenia melleni (MacCallum, 1927) Yamaguti, 1963 and report this species for the first time in Australia. I examined the pathogenesis caused by this parasite by histology of host tissue. Possible routes of introduction to the farm in question are investigated and studies are detailed that should be undertaken in Australia to manage future outbreaks of N. melleni. Capsalids usually colonise new hosts by an infective ciliated oncomiracidium. An experiment was conducted to ascertain whether cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus could transfer adult skin-parasitic monogeneans from one host fish to another. I have shown that transmission of adult monogeneans between two individuals of Hemigymnus melapterus by cleaner fish can occur. In coral reef environments, frequent contact between unrelated hosts involved in cleaning interactions might create previously unsuspected evolutionary pressures. I discuss the implications of this discovery for host-specificity and lateral transmission of monogeneans. General biological studies of monogeneans are necessary to understand the evolution, pathology, epidemiology, phylogeny and taxonomy of these parasites. My study provides a taxonomic system which, when applied to other capsalid subfamilies, should help prevent errors and create a clear system of classification for the entire family.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270299 Genetics not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Benedeniinae</field><field name="subject">Capsalidae</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">parasite</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157960</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins and Evolution of the North-Eastern and Central Polabian (Wendish) Religious and Political System</field><field name="creator">Zaroff, Roman</field><field name="description">The term Polabian Slavs is a generic name applied to the westernmost branch of the Western Slavs, now almost extinct. Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of Arabidopsis DRGs : Clues from the DRG2 interactor PDL1</field><field name="creator">Plume, Andrew Michael</field><field name="description">The GTP hydrolases (GTPases) are a ubiquitous superfamily of proteins with diverse cellular roles. Members of the recently-discovered DRG subfamily have been implicated in human disease and may play a role in cell division, differentiation or death. While recent work in our laboratory has focused on the expression and subcellular localisation of DRG1 and DRG2 in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Etheridge et al., 1999; Etheridge, 2002), our understanding of the role of these proteins in planta remains unclear. A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) library screen using Arabidopsis DRG2 as bait identified 16 interacting proteins, 75% of which are predicted to reside in cellular compartments other than the cytoplasm. Since DRG2 has previously been localised to cytoplasmic vesicles, this observation suggests that DRG2 could be involved in the trafficking of these proteins to their correct cellular locations. A single DRG2 interactor, DRGIP4, was selected for detailed study and its interaction with DRG2 was confirmed in vivo and in vitro. Based on sequence similarity to Pseudomonas PCD/DCoH, DRGIP4 was renamed PDL1 (PCD/DCoH-like protein 1). Members of the widespread PCD/DCoH family are bifunctional proteins which possess catalytic and transcriptional coactivation functions in different cellular compartments and in different oligomeric states. PDL1 is encoded by a single-copy gene in Arabidopsis and shares remarkable secondary and tertiary structural conservation with members of the PCD/DCoH family and is also capable of homomeric associations. PDL1 contains an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide (cTP) which is functional in planta and is important for interaction with DRG2, suggesting that these proteins interact in the cytoplasm prior to the import of PDL1 into the chloroplast. PDL1 lacks most of the residues important for PCD/DCoH enzymatic activity but may retain a transcriptional coactivation function in the chloroplast. PDL1 homologs in other plants also contain an N-terminal cTP and a PCD/DCoH domain. pdl1 mRNA is expressed at moderate to high levels in the aerial tissues but not in the roots. Accumulation of pdl1 transcripts is light-inducible, and the pdl1 promoter contains several cis-elements which may be responsible for light-responsive transcription. Expression of the intron-GUS reporter gene under the control of the pdl1 promoter generally correlates with mRNA accumulation but reveals tight spatial control of gene expression. Overexpression of pdl1 in transgenic plants does not result in an obvious phenotype. However, downregulation of pdl1 in transgenic plants results in a pale green leaf phenotype associated with a reduction in photosynthetic pigment content and chloroplast numbers per cell. Leaf internal architecture and chloroplast ultrastructure are unaffected in these plants. This phenotype is similar to the arc (accumulation and replication of chloroplasts) mutants and mutants in the chloroplast division and protein import machinery. PDL1 may therefore be involved in the process or regulation of chloroplast division in Arabidopsis. The pdl1 downregulation phenotype is also associated with pleiotropic effects on plant growth. A second PCD/DCoH-like protein, PDL2, was identified in the Arabidopsis genome sequence. Like PDL1, PDL2 shares limited primary sequence similarity to members of the PCD/DCoH family but retains characteristic secondary and tertiary structural features. PDL2 contains an N-terminal mitochondrial transit peptide (mTP) and is expressed at low levels in all plant tissues. PDL2 homologs in other plants also contain an N-terminal mTP and a PCD/DCoH domain. The significance of PDL2 for the function of PDL1 and DRG2 is not yet clear. Overexpression of drg1 in transgenic plants does not result in an obvious phenotype, while downregulation of drg1 in transgenic plants affects general aspects of plant growth which may be unrelated to DRG1 function. To investigate the role of DRGs in a different model system, homologs of drg1 and drg2 were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker&#146;s yeast) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). Knockout of either or both genes in transgenic yeast is non-lethal and results in sensitivity to agents which disrupt intra- and inter-molecular protein interactions. This phenotype is consistent with a role in protein trafficking. Overexpression of drg1 or drg2 in S. cerevisiae does not result in an obvious phenotype, while overexpression of either gene in S. pombe results in a slow growth phenotype. DRG1 and DRG2 are localised in the cytoplasm in S. pombe. The results presented here suggest that DRGs may be involved in the trafficking of proteins to different subcellular compartments. This research has provided a foundation for the detailed functional characterisation of plant and yeast DRGs and of the novel PDL family in Arabidopsis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158746</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inconsistencies in the rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions</field><field name="creator">Thackeray, Vincent Gregory</field><field name="description">Government intervention in the financial and social affairs of citizens has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. As a result, government administrative decisions continually affect the everyday lives of people. Many of these decisions are discretionary. Modern administrative law has grown to meet the need for governments, rather than the courts, to supervise the exercise of administrative power so that injustice resulting from misuse of power can be avoided. The merits review system is an integral part of this administrative law. The effectiveness of the merits review system is dependent upon how Parliament makes provision for merits review in the legislative process. The object of this thesis is to analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of the scope of the Commonwealth administrative law merits review system. An evaluation of the availability of rights of review of the merits of Commonwealth administrative decisions will determine the extent to which Commonwealth law provides for merits review of administrative decisions. This thesis makes such an evaluation by undertaking an empirical study of the merits review provisions in Commonwealth legislation. The empirical study analyses 1,070 Commonwealth statutes and establishes that there are 340 statutes that confer power to make a reviewable decision or decisions. However, only 30 percent of these statutes provide for merits review of all reviewable decisions, while 44 percent provide for merits review of some decisions and 26 percent do not provide for merits review of any decisions. Consequently, the empirical study identifies inconsistencies in the provision of merits review of Commonwealth administrative decisions. The Australian parliamentary executive system of government has permitted a breakdown in the legislative drafting process that has allowed these inconsistencies to develop. Moreover, the executive arm of the Commonwealth government has diminished its accountability to Parliament for some of the administrative decisions made by it. A person affected by an unreviewable administrative decision may be treated unjustly as a result.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="subject">Inconsistencies</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">merits</field><field name="subject">review</field><field name="subject">Commonwealth</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">administrative</field><field name="subject">decisions</field><field name="subject">Kerr</field><field name="subject">Executive</field><field name="subject">unaccountable</field><field name="subject">Parliament</field><field name="subject">injustice</field><field name="subject">empirical</field><field name="subject">study</field><field name="subject">statutes</field><field name="subject">legislation. breakdown</field><field name="subject">legislative</field><field name="subject">drafting</field><field name="subject">process</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary</field><field name="subject">Counsel</field><field name="subject">Administrative</field><field name="subject">Review</field><field name="subject">Tribunal</field><field name="subject">Council</field><field name="subject">Attorney-General</field><field name="subject">appeal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157885</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical approaches to improve the value of the Falkland Islands' sheep and wool industry</field><field name="creator">Miller, Sean Michael</field><field name="description">Studies were conducted to determine basic aspects of intake and digestion of native pastures by young sheep in the Falkland Islands, and to evaluate practical methods to improve the productivity of these animals. The studies were conducted in support of Industry and Government initiatives to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture. The current industry is based on broad diameter wools harvested from sheep grazing poor quality native pastures, and sheep suffer low growth rates, poor productivity and high mortality, and farmers rely on small flocks to produce a single commodity for their total income. The dramatic collapse of wool markets in the 1980&#146;s crippled the Falklands&#146; wool industry and farmers have relied heavily on subsidies for more than 12 years. The studies in this thesis were initiated to support the efforts to reinvigorate Falklands&#146; agriculture, and they examined basic aspects of the nutrition provided to sheep by native pastures and evaluated practical methods to improve the survival of sheep, their subsequent rate of growth and productive value to the economy. Five studies examined specific hypotheses posed at the outset of the research programme and they were broadly supported by the data presented in the thesis: &#183; A wether trial was used to benchmark the productivity of wool sheep in the Islands, and the trial demonstrated that substantial genetic variation exists within the national flock that may be exploited in the future to improve the productivity of the wool industry, &#183; Microhistological techniques were used in conjunction with n-alkane marker technology to investigate the diets consumed by sheep grazing native pastures. The diet studies concluded that the low quality of native pasture in the Falklands during autumn, winter and spring restricts growth and productivity of young sheep, &#183; Studies with weaner sheep treated with controlled release anthelmintics established that infection with gastrointestinal nematodes exacerbates poor nutrition of young sheep consuming native pastures, &#183; A short-term metabolism study demonstrated that native pasture hay fortified with molasses and urea, or winter forage crops may be used as supplements to enhance sheep productivity, and &#183; Forage crops were grown and evaluated under Falklands&#146; conditions, and when lambs were fed the resulting highly productive and nutritious forages, the study demonstrated that lamb growth can be increased significantly, and lamb carcasses offer local farmers the potential to diversify farm income by using existing Falklands&#146;-bred lambs to develop an export meat industry The data presented in this thesis demonstrate that the potential to improve the productive and financial position of Falklands&#146; farmers is substantial. If both the local Industry and Government maintain their joint commitment to industry-restructure, pastoral development and enterprise diversification, the Falklands&#146; agricultural economy stands to benefit considerably by adopting low risk solutions to address widespread problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630102 Sheep-wool</field><field name="subject">native pasture</field><field name="subject">alkanes</field><field name="subject">wool quality</field><field name="subject">sheep diets</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal parasitism</field><field name="subject">urea-molasses treatment</field><field name="subject">brassicas</field><field name="subject">carcass quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157933</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer production from synthetic carbonaceous wastewater using glycogen accumulating organisms</field><field name="creator">Dai, Yu</field><field name="description">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters produced and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy by a wide range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175-180&amp;degC. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non-3HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3HB and 3HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3- hydroxyalkanoate (3HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3HMV) and 3-hydroxy-3- methylbutyrate (3HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3HB, 3HV and minor amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &amp;sup1H and &#185;&amp;sup3C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non-3HB monomers (30&#177;5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3HV fraction. The 3HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28% of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41% based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both the quantity and quality of the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3HB-co-3HV-co-3HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380-460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95&#177;3%) copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3HMV and 3HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3HB and 3HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390-560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 &amp;degC, glass transition temperatures between -8 and 0 &amp;degC, and melting enthalpies (&#916;Hm) between 9.1 and 31.5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3HV&amp;3HMV-rich copolymers and 3HB&amp;3HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158279</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc></add>
